Espenilla Jr. blamed the lower September remittances figure to the 11.7-percent drop in cash remittances from land-based workers which offset the 6-percent increase in transfers from sea-based workers.There are reports that a number of global correspondent banks have closed their service facilities on money service business, reflective of the increasing global trend to reduce correspondent banking relationships and focus more on home market. This may have partly affected remittances flows during the month, Espenilla explained.Espenilla said the largest drops in cash remittances that month were recorded from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Australia.For Saudi Arabia, the decline in remittances could partly be the result of the continued repatriation of overseas Filipino workers under the Saudi Arabian amnesty program which started last March. On Sept. 26, the Saudi government extended the amnesty program anew and a total of 8,467 undocumented Filipinos already availed of the initial offer, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Espenilla noted.From January to September, cash remittances reached $20.781 billion, up 3.8 percent from $20.025 billion in the same nine-month period last year.As of end-September, cash remittances from land-based and sea-based workers grew by 3.8 percent and 3.5 percent to reach $16.4 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, according to Espenilla.The top sources of cash remittances at end-September were Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, with these 10 countries accounting for almost three-fourths of the nine-month total.ADVERTISEMENTCash remittances are projected to hit a record $28 billion by yearend.The BSP had kept the 4-percent remittances growth target for 2017, although the value of the updated projection made in June was higher than the earlier forecast of $27.7 billion.Last year, cash sent home by overseas Filipinos through banks reached a record-high $26.9 billion, 5-percent higher than 2015s $25.6 billion.Remittances are the countrys largest source of foreign exchange income, insulating the domestic economy from external shocks by ensuring the steady supply of dollars into the system.Also, these cash transfers are a major driver for domestic consumption, hence contributing to strong economic growth. /je",Remittances down 8.3% in September

The Japanese side thinks that the premiers first visit to Japan for a trilateral summit meeting among Japan, China and South Korea would be a step toward realiSing reciprocal visits by the two countries leaders, Abe and Xi, according to a senior Foreign Ministry official.The Japanese government is therefore accelerating efforts to arrange the schedule with China and South Korea, in order to hold the trilateral summit as early as possible.The meeting between Abe and Xi that was held in Vietnam on Saturday prior to the talks between Abe and Li was carried out in the best mood so far, according to an official who attended the Abe-Xi meeting. When discussing the issue of North Korea, the two leaders were able to exchange honest views without looking at response guidelines prepared in advance. They also confirmed that they would hold telephone conferences more frequently in the future.Abe is accelerating efforts to improve the relationship with China because he hopes to cooperate with China on strengthening bilateral economic cooperation and dealing with North Korea. Since Xi established his position as a single, powerful leader at the Communist Party of Chinas National Congress in October, there are expectations among Japanese government officials that he can now more easily make a decision to improve ties with Japan.However, given the situation in the East China Sea, including the regular incursions by Chinese government vessels into Japanese waters around the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture and Chinas unilateral development of gas fields, many believe it will not be easy to resolve the confrontation between the two countries, according to a senior Foreign Ministry official.Another reason behind Abes inclination toward diplomacy with China appears to be the fact that it will take time to produce results in talks with Russia.Abe aims to conclude a peace treaty that will include the resolution of the northern territories issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has held many summit meetings with him for this purpose.However, Putin said at a press conference on Saturday that it is not important, for the purpose of concluding a peace treaty, whether the leaders are Abe, Putin or other people, revealing a difference of opinion with Abe.",Abe aims to boost own govt by improving ties with China

As well, another aide, Carter Page, told Congress in private statements that he had alerted Sessions about a meeting he planned in Russia during the campaign.Sessions said he had no recollection of the conversation with Page. And he said that though he did not initially recall a March 2016 conversation with Papadopoulos, he now believes after seeing media reports about it that he told Papadopoulos that he was not authorized to represent the Trump campaign with the Russian government or any other foreign government.Papadopoulos was arrested by the FBI and pleaded guilty to lying to authorities about his own foreign contacts during the campaign.I pushed back, Ill just say it that way, Sessions said under questioning, later adding that he was concerned that he not go off somewhere pretending to represent the Trump campaign.Sessions insisted that his story had never changed and that he had never been dishonest.

1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"BEIJING  Following President Donald Trumps visit to Beijing, China said Wednesday that it would send a high-level special envoy to North Korea amid an extended chill in relations between the neighbors over Pyongyangs nuclear weapons and missile programs.Song Tao, the head of Chinas ruling Communist Partys International Department, will travel to Pyongyang on Friday to report on outcomes of the partys national congress held last month, the official Xinhua News Agency said.Xinhua said Song, as president and party leader Xi Jinpings special envoy, would carry out a visit in addition to delivering his report, but gave no details about his itinerary or meetings. It also made no mention of Trumps trip to Beijing or the Norths weapons programs, although Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to do more to use its influence to pressure Pyongyang into altering its behavior.ADVERTISEMENTForeign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang downplayed any connection between Songs trip and Trumps visit, saying it was common practice for the Communist Party and North Koreas ruling Workers Party to exchange views.The purpose of this visit is to brief about the party congress and exchange views on issues of common interest and bilateral interest, Geng said at a regularly scheduled briefing.Song would be the first ministerial-level Chinese official to visit North Korea since October 2015, when Politburo Standing Committee member Liu Yunshan met with leader Kim Jong Un. Liu delivered a letter to Kim from Xi expressing hopes for a strong relationship, although the respite in frosty ties proved short-lived. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin visited Pyongyang in October of last year.The two ruling parties have long-standing ties that often supersede formal diplomacy, even while Beijing has long been frustrated with Pyongyangs provocations and unwillingness to reform its economy.However, Song is not directly connected to Chinas efforts to convince Pyongyang to cease its nuclear weapons program and return to talks, downplaying the chances for a breakthrough in that highly contentious area.China is also North Koreas largest trading partner and chief source of food and fuel aid, although it says its influence with Kims regime is often exaggerated by the U.S. and others. While it is enforcing harsh new U.N. sanctions targeting the Norths sources of foreign currency, Beijing has called for steps to renew dialogue.Beijing is also opposed to measures that could bring down Kims regime, possibly depriving it of a buffer with South Korea and the almost 30,000 U.S. troops stationed there, and leading to a refugee crisis and chaos along its border with the North.In Beijing last week, Trump urged Xi to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.ADVERTISEMENTChina can fix the problem easily and quickly, Trump said in remarks to journalists alongside Xi. He urged Xi to hopefully work on it very hard.If he works on it hard, it will happen. Theres no doubt about it, Trump said.While calling the visit significant, a top Chinese expert on North Korea relations downplayed any connection with Trumps statements in Beijing, saying it fit a pattern of traditional exchanges between the two parties following significant events such as national congresses.Representatives are dispatched to brief the other side at a chosen time and chosen level. It is a tradition and it is unnecessary to connect it with Trumps visit to China, said Guo Rui, researcher at the Institute for North Korean and South Korean Studies at Jilin University in northeastern China.However, he said the visit shows Chinas willingness to see a continuous development of the friendly relations between the two sides.Although the Korean Peninsula situation has been evolving fast with worrisome indications, the two parties are maintaining normal exchanges, and that is of significance for stabilizing the bilateral relations and the peninsular situation, Guo said.The nature of Songs visit as a party-to-party exchange rather than one between the two governments appears to paint it as a bilateral attempt to strengthen relations, said John Delury, a professor at Seouls Yonsei University who specializes in Korea and China.The fact that Song was identified as Xis special envoy also suggests that Xi is personally making a push to open the channel at a higher level and engage more constructively with Kim, Delury said.This is a chance to see if he can open things up, he said. The relationship has been so frosty, it will be interesting to see if theres some improvement in the bilateral ties.North Korea staged its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, detonating what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb, and last launched a ballistic missile on Sept. 15, firing it over the Japanese island of Hokkaido into the Pacific Ocean.Since then, there has been a lull in such activity, leading to some hopes in Beijing that Pyongyang might be responding to international pressure and becoming more amenable to talks.Songs visit to Pyongyang also comes as China and South Korea are repairing their relations, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in scheduled to visit next month for talks with Xi.Previously warm ties soured last year over Seouls decision to deploy a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system aimed at guarding against North Korean threats.Beijing claimed the THAAD system damaged its own security because its radars could observe military movements within northeastern China and retaliated by banning Chinese tour groups from visiting and interfering in the China operations of South Korean companies.While South Korea resisted Chinas demands to withdraw the system, Beijing appeared satisfied with a pledge from Seoul not to expand it, among other commitments.",China sending envoy to North Korea following Trump visit

It also meets the long-term, fundamental interests of the regions people, he said.Over the past two decades, Li said, 10+3 cooperation has become one of the most remarkable achievements in Asia, contributing to regional peace and development.ADVERTISEMENTLi said it is important to seize the opportunity to push forward the construction of an East Asia economic community to make the region an engine for global economic recovery amid the rise of anti-globalisation sentiments and trade protectionism.Construction of such a community should boost regional economic integration for common development, while putting Asean in a central position and adhering to consensus through consultation, the Chinese premier said.He also said 10+3 cooperation is the main channel for promoting the East Asia Economic Community.Li put forward a six-point proposal to do this involving trade liberalisation and facilitation, production capacity, infrastructure, finance, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges.As China keeps opening up, a more open and prosperous China will provide more markets, growth, investment and opportunity for cooperation for countries in East Asia and globally, Li added.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South KoreanPresident Moon Jae-in and leaders of the 10 member states of Asean also attended the meeting, presided over by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

Investors assess these sectors to have significant potential and they have been prioritised by the Vietnamese government.Chu Ngoc Anh, Minister of Science and Technology, said that the start-up scene in Vietnam had been vibrant over the past few years, especially since the project 844 on Supporting National Innovative Start-up Eco-system towards 2025 was launched last year.More than 900 incubated start-up projects with 300 start-up products have been connected with communities and investment funds. In 2016 and 2017, Vietnamese innovative start-ups activities have been vibrant. The five most successful commercial deals attracted more than US$50million in investment.There are more than 40 venture capital funds in Vietnam including IDG Ventures, CyberAgent Ventures, Captii Ventures, Gobi Partners and 500 Startups. Many large corporations, companies and banks have set up funds for startups, including FPT Ventures, Viettel Venture, CMC Creative Fund and the Vietnam Accelerator Fund.Vietnams Global Innovative Index in 2017 made a significant step: it now ranks 47th out of 127, its highest ranking ever and leading middle-income countries.Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam urged start-up founders to be bold and confident.Dont worry that your ideas will not win any award, or be like a fish out of water, he said. Dont worry that your locality is still poor, which constrains innovative start-ups. Dont worry that your innovation is like others and raise the question of whether it will be successful or not.He highlighted the importance of scientific capital and support to build co-working spaces and incubators.

Finland had been supporting Vietnams innovation with the Vietnam-Finland Innovation Partnership Programme.The special key is the private sector. Support from legislation and the budget is very important.

Over the last three or maybe five years, the community has really got going. I think if you look around today at Techfest, we can see how vibrant the community is now. People are gaining experience. Not only we are developing more start-ups but those start-ups are maturing.South Korean investor Yu Benjamin, the director of LINE Ventures, came to Techfest to seek start-ups in financial technology (fintech).If GDP grows people will spend more money.

The armys spokesman was not available to comment.The governments silence on the military deployments seem to confirm that President Mugabe has lost control of the situation, Robert Besseling, of the London-based EXX Africa risk consultancy, said.Any coup would be likely to involve the imposition of a curfew.The main indicator of a broader outbreak of violence would be the reaction of the Presidential Guard, which remains loyal to President Mugabe.Mugabe is the worlds oldest head of state, but his poor health has fuelled a bitter succession battle as potential replacements jockey for position.In speeches this year, Mugabe has often slurred his words, mumbled and paused for long periods.His lengthy rule has been marked by brutal repression of dissent, mass emigration, vote-rigging and economic collapse since land reforms in 2000.The main opposition MDC party called for civilian rule to be protected.No one wants to see a coup If the army takes over that will be undesirable. It will bring democracy to a halt, shadow defence minister Gift Chimanikire, told AFP on Tuesday.Graces ambitionsSpeculation has been rife in Harare that Mugabe could seek to remove Chiwenga, who is seen as an ally of ousted Mnangagwa.Mnangagwa, 75, was widely viewed as Mugabes most loyal lieutenant, having worked alongside him for decades.Earlier this year the country was gripped by a bizarre spat between Grace and Mnangagwa that included an alleged ice-cream poisoning incident that laid bare the pairs rivalry.Grace Mugabe  41 years younger than her husband  has become increasingly active in public life in what many say was a process to help her eventually take the top job.She was granted diplomatic immunity in South Africa in August after she allegedly assaulted a model at an expensive Johannesburg hotel where the couples two sons were staying.As the economy collapsed, Zimbabwe was engulfed by hyperinflation and was forced to abandon its own currency in 2009 in favour of the US dollar.The country, which has an unemployment rate of over 90 percent, is due to hold elections next year with Mugabe pledging to stand for office again.",Power slips from Mugabe as military steps in
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Its a bit strange to see Chinese president Xi Jinping, of all people, defending globalization and economic liberalization in the face of resistance from Donald Trump, the leader of the capitalistic world. But here we are, getting accustomed to a scenario that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago.In a way, Trumps America First policy signifies the United States voluntary retreat from the global stagein this case, the Asia-Pacific or the Indo-Asian region, where it has dominated for decades. For China, extending influence in the countries in Asia, which Trumps America is poised to leave in the lurch, is a part of its grand vision to become a global leader in terms of composite national strength.Trumps five-nation tour of Asia, his first as a president, was primarily intended to address two major issues: North Koreas nuclear threat, and trade. Trump sounded solicitous when he urged the world to back the United States in its effort to confront North Korea. The longer we wait, he said, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become. When it comes to trade, however, he made it clear that no one should expect America on their side.ADVERTISEMENTHis contradictory messages have left allies, adversaries and even observers scratching their heads over his true motives. From the Qatar crisis to the North Korean threat, Trump appeared to contradict his own State Department. His diplomats are aware of the ground reality and want him to go about it more diplomatically. His political advisers, on the other hand, are pushing him to take a solid economically nationalistic or protectionist stance, which they believe will revive jobs and industries that the Americans lost. For a superpower like the US, sadly, trade is integral to its unified role in the world. Therefore, Trumps approach towards Asia, which many called transactional and pragmatic, is caught in the crossfire between two opposite forces.Trumps strategy to push different policies for different nations, instead of a unified one, has already shown signs of weakness. In a bid to convince China to pressurise its ally North Korea, Trump momentarily had to tone down his trade rhetoric that casts China as the villain. While he blamed China for all the miseries of the American people during his election campaign, he now concedes, saying: After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country to the benefit of its citizens? He had once branded China an enemy perpetrating the greatest theft in the history of the world. Now, he seems optimistic about the possibilities of a partnership between the two nations, saying, together, they could solve almost all of the worlds problems.Trumps Asia tour also exposes another of his weaknesses as a leader. Every country in the region seemed to have resorted to the most effective strategy to please him: flattery. In the South Korean legislature, for example, he was introduced as the leader of the world. China perhaps outdid everyone else in terms of welcoming him. But when it came to flattery, in China, it was not the host country that flattered himlet alone calling him the leader of the worldbut the other way around.Trump not only offered personal praise for Xi Jinping and played a video clip of his granddaughter singing in Mandarin, but also refrained from making remarks about Chinas poor human rights records, a customary criticism from US presidents. The New York Times called it a remarkable moment when Trump projected an air of deference to China that was almost unheard-of for a visiting American president. In Vietnam and Philippines, too, he stressed the importance of their independence and sovereignty, glossing over their questionable human rights records or state of democracy. Thats the cost of Trumps pragmatic and transactional approach that only cares about deals, not about exporting the American values.In Vietnam, he went back to his candidate mode and unloaded his vociferous rhetoric, saying the US would never sign any region-wide trade treaty under his presidency, and America would no longer be taken advantage of.The Asian countries, on their part, did not hesitate to make it clear that they would go ahead with or without US support. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forums summit, 11 Asia-Pacific nations agreed to press ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaty, from which President Trump had withdrawn his country shortly after his inauguration, fulfilling a campaign promise.In defiance of Trumps protectionist position on trade, the 20 remaining APEC members also denounced efforts to create new trade barriers in a joint communiqu that excluded the United States.China clearly seeks to take over some of the ground that once was under American influence. Right after Donald Trump finished his speech at the APEC summit, Xi Jinping came to declare that, Opening up will bring progress, and those who close down will inevitably lag behind. He discussed issues like innovation and climate changethings that, in the past, would have come from the visiting American leader.ADVERTISEMENTThe South East Asian countries need more than strategic security as a buffer against Chinas growing influence. They also need trade incentives from the West. In the absence of Americas assurance with regard to trade, they may be driven further into Chinas orbit, which is not necessarily a bad thing altogether for the countries in the region.Yet, that is unlikely to bar Trump from claiming that his visit was a massive success. Many agree, but its a pity that the success is not necessarily Americas.",China embraces possibilities as Trump looks inward

In 2002, while working, Cesars knees were injured when he fell from a scissor lift. He was absent from work a total of 9 1/2 months. In 2009, a 100-pound motor at work fell on him, further aggravating his knee injuries. He again went on a leave of absence from April 2009 through February 2011. He underwent a total of four right-knee surgeries and 3 left-knee surgeries.At first, the company accommodated Cesars work restrictions and provided him a golf cart to use to get around the large facility. However, the employer later changed its policy and no longer allowed employees to return to work if they have medical work restrictions.ADVERTISEMENTWhen Cesar returned to work from his recent leave, he was demoted from his supervisor position and placed under the supervision of the employee hired to replace him during his medical leave. However, since Cesar knew more about the machines at the facility, the new supervisor often asked him about the work. Cesar claimed that when he asked for a full paycheck, his supervisor had told him that Snap-On did not want to pay him a full paycheck when he was only half a man.In the spring of 2011, he told his employer that he was going to need another surgery and a leave of absence beginning in April. Two weeks later employer fired Cesar for allegedly accepting money from contractors.Cesar sued the employer for wrongful termination based on disability discrimination, among others. During the litigation, the employer provided an additional reason for Cesars firing  that Snap-On had conducted an investigation without Cesars knowledge and allegedly found that Cesar was soliciting bribes from vendors. However, the vendor denied this. The only evidence the employer had of Cesar accepting a bribe was the testimony of the supervisor and the company comptroller, who said the vendor had admitted the bribery to them.During trial, the supervisor and the comptroller gave several different versions of the alleged bribery. Because of inconsistent stories, neither witness seemed credible.It was obvious that the employer wanted to get rid of Cesar and had to come up with an excuse to fire him. However, the facts surrounding the firing seem to point to employers reason as simply pretext.A pretext is an alleged purpose or motive that an employer adopts in order to hide its real intention. In most discrimination cases, one of the most important hurdles an employee needs to overcome is to show that the employers stated reason for the firing is false. The employers pretext is merely to hide its real motive, which is discrimination.There are several methods to prove pretext. One is to show that the employee was treated differently compared with other employees who had a similar issue (e.g. employees were not usually fired for this reason). Another is to show how the employer reacted to the employees situation (e.g. employer was upset when employee asked for leave). Or the employee can show how the employer treated her/him in relation to their disability (e.g. employer assigned employee to harder tasks, unusual schedules, or made derogatory comments about the employees condition).Where an employee successfully shows that the employers reason for the firing is pretext, the employee comes one step closer to showing that the termination was illegal.ADVERTISEMENTIn Cesars case, after a three-week trial, the jury found in favor of Cesar and awarded him $5 million in compensatory damages, and $10 million in punitive damages, for a total award of $15 million.The Law Offices of C.

Convirs-Fowler said shes part Filipino and is a Democrat.She claims to be 1/4 Filipino, a friend who lives in the area told me. But no one knows her or her family.The person I talked to was a Democrat, who this week was happy to vote for the Republican Filipino.While race has been used by politician Trump to divide the electorate and fill the rhetoric with hate, race can also be used as a unifying factor.In other words, race does have the power to trump Trumpy politics.When one sees a Filipino face, there is a tendency to vote for the person who looks like you. You like them. You trust them. They get your vote. Especially if you find people who actually are brave enough to stand up, speak out and run for office.Ron is Filipino, said my friend in Virginia Beach. Despite being a Republican, he has always been involved in our Filipino American community. He has always put our community first before politics. Fowler, on the other hand, has never been involved in our community. She has done nothing and announced her Filipino-ness a few months ago to push her agenda. Will give her the benefit of the doubt, but for now, we lost a great political asset in Ron.You cant always assume an Asian American or a Filipino American is a Democrat, or thinks like you. In fact, most Asian American surveys point out how conservative Filipinos are.ADVERTISEMENTAnd yet does being a Democrat or Republican even matter if race can get beyond ideology and build a sense of partisanship based on community and what it needs?That was good enough for some Democrats I know in the minority in Virginia Beach to back Republican Villanueva.But Villanueva had some problems in this campaign with stories tying him to a corrupt defense contractor. And then there was the overall Trumpudiation he had to overcome. The Democratic wave that emerged on Tuesday just seemed like it was going to wipe out most Republicans.It did.Its left my friend wondering where this all leaves the Filipinos of all political stripes in Virginia.Mostly without a go-to person. And without a real direction.Race does trump politics, my friend insisted. Politicians here feel our community is very powerful and can sway a candidates outcome. Since Ron lost, the illusion of the Filipino vote is now lost, i.e., the Filipino community is not as powerful politically as politicians thought.Dont get me wrong. I feel the Trumpudiation, in general, is ultimately a good thing for Asian America and Filipino Americans.But it must be noted that not everyone in Virginia is cheering. There was at least one Filipino American casualtyRon Villanueva.Ron has served our community, our city and our state as a Filipino American for nine years, said my friend, who admitted he often disagreed with Villanueva, but then they could always find common ground. He would say, What do you call the only other Filipino you see at a Republican or Democrat gathering?He paused.Brother.One more weekend of Amok Monologues: NPR, Harvard and more at the Charm City Fringe Festival in Baltimore.

A good routine starts with only a handful of products and the most basic of steps until you work your way up to figuring out your skins individual needs. Only then do skin-specific steps like serums, ampoules, and acids come in.It helps to figure out your skin type first.

Acne and blackheads are often attributed to people with oily skin, though they dont always go hand-in-hand. Its important to focus on balancing oil production rather than stripping the oil. Combination skin, in comparison to oily skin, leaves a noticeable shine on the T-zone but feels dry everywhere else. Combination skin is treated similarly to oily skin, though different areas may have different needs.Its important to note that dry skin is usually associated with colder climates and oily/combination skin is usually associated with warmer, more humid climates like ours. You may want to adjust your routine according to the weather. Right now, the cooler rainy season means that dry skin types ought to take extra care in keeping their skin hydrated and oily skin types can more comfortably use heavier moisturizers. When starting out, its a good idea to choose products that adapt well to weather changes, like moisturizers that can be layered on during colder seasons or sunscreen that is easily reapplied for the summer months.ADVERTISEMENTStep 1: CleanserA low pH cleanser is a great first step in forming your skincare routine. Its in charge of washing off the dirt and excess oil at the start and end of the day. Youll want a cleanser with a pH below 7 to maintain your skins naturally acidic pH. Bar soap just doesnt cut it as they can be very drying with a pH of 9-10. This article is a great read for more information on pH levels and skincare.But wait, do you need to tone after cleansing? No you dont, if you used a pH-balanced cleanser! Toners were made to tone back down the pH level of skin to its normal acidity. If you washed your face with the correct cleanser, toners are just optional.ThINQ is the Inquirer's attempt to highlight in the public space the distinct viewpoints contributed by bloggers covering a wide range of topics and issues.If you'd like to be included in the ThINQ blogger network, e-mail sara.pacia@inquirer.net with the subject ""ThINQ Membership"" along with your blog's URL and topics your blog currently covers.",A beginners guide to skincare: the four basic steps to good skin

Thank you for making it such a special night.Im happy and relieved that I can play freely against (Marin) Cilic, instead of it being a nail-biter. Its been a tough group so to be through in two matches is great.Both players were scratchy on serve at the start of the match but were quickly into the groove in a tight first set that saw no breaks of serve, though Zverev had to fend off two set points in the 12th game to force a tie-break.The 20-year-old third seed raced into a 4-0 advantage only to see the Swiss charge back to lead 5-4. Zverev earned a set point of his own at 6-5 but could not convert and Federer made his third set point count.The 19-time Grand Slam champion broke in the first game of the second set to establish an iron grip on the round-robin match but Zverev hit back in the fourth to get back on level terms.Federer only landed 43 percent of first serves in the second set and it finally cost him in the 12th game, when Zverev capitalized on his third set point to force a decider.The Swiss re-found his focus and some consistency on serve in the decider as Zverevs level dipped, earning three breaks to close it out 6-1.Zverev has been touted as the leader of a pack of young players hungry to oust the creaking old guard but Federer, who has suffered only four defeats all year, shows no sign of slipping.ADVERTISEMENTComing into the match Federer, 36, and Zverev had faced each other four times and each had won twice.This year, Federer beat the German in Halle but Zverev returned the favor at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.Earlier, also in the Boris Becker group, Jack Sock kept his dreams of a fairytale finish to his season alive, beating Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).Its been an interesting morning so far, said the American.

Obviously we can replace it nutritionally but the idea that we might be without it is really unbearable, he added.French people eat more butter per capita than anyone else in the world  three times more than Americans  yet still have among the lowest obesity levels of developed countries.Faced with mounting anxiety about having to go without butter, churn makers told AFP that enquiries from city dwellers who clearly had no access to dairy cows had soared, while a spate of YouTube videos showing people how to make butter have been viewed tens of thousands of times within days of going online.Its been a long time since I did a video which took off so quickly, said popular recipe blogger Herve Palmieri.The last one that went viral with a few million views was ironically about how to make a chocolate cake without butter or sugar, he added.Google said internet searches on how to make butter had rocketed 925 percent between September and October.World has gone madADVERTISEMENTWholesale prices for butter more than tripled over the past year driven by rising demand in Asia, with Chinese consumers in particular reportedly developing a weakness for flaky, butter-rich croissants.With many French supermarkets refusing to pay higher prices because they tend to fix them annually, butter has gone abroad.The drop in supplies has been accentuated by panic buying, with the safety net of the EUs once enormous butter mountain no longer there, having melted away to a mere one percent of its size last year.Parisian baker Dominique Eury said he had never encountered such a shortage in the 44 years he has been manning his oven in the 17th district of the capital.Ten days ago I could not get the butter or cream that I needed. Until now we have got by, what is really worrying me is the holidays. The world has gone mad, he said.Eury said he gets through twice as much butter during Christmas as he makes the traditional buche chocolate log dessert and the marzipan galette of the kings the French eat in January.With his suppliers only able to get their hands on 80 percent of the butter they want, Eury said he was putting stocks aside just in case of a crisis over the Christmas period.Butter makes us happyThe idea that they could make do with margarine is not something French bakers are prepared to contemplate.We make everything with butter, said Arnaud Delmontel, who has four bakeries in the capital.Although he believes the shortage is not real, he complained that the rise in prices has become unreasonable, and some of the butter he has received had clearly been frozen.People are speculating and making a lot of money, he claimed.Global demand for butter is outstripping supply, according to the US Department of Agriculture, as consumers turn away from vegetable-oil based products in search of something safer.Butters image as a cholesterol-choked dietary bad guy has changed radically in recent years. Many scientists now say it is neutral health-wise  news that Time magazine celebrated with a 2014 cover proclaiming, Eat butter.All of which further reinforces the French emotional attachment to its creamy comforts, Lucas argued.Grandmothers in the buttery heartlands of Brittany and Normandy still use it as a cure-all for bumps and bruises and Lucas said this brings us back to our childhood to the intimate comforts and joy of butter at breakfast and in afternoon snacks. Naturally butter is something that makes us happy.Until the shortage, he said, butter was just something in our fridges. We had taken it for granted because we always had it, except during World War II.Having to worry about getting enough was shocking and paradoxical to French people, the sociologist insisted.In the Land of Butter we find it extremely difficult to imagine that we can live without it.",Butter shortage chills Frances patisserie-loving soul

The word masterpiece barely begins to convey the rarity, importance, and sublime beauty of Leonardos painting.Wintermute called it the Holy Grail of old master paintings.A backer of the auction has guaranteed a bid of at least $100 million (85 million euros). Experts have said it might be worth more, except for its generally poor state of preservation and lingering questions about its authenticity.The 26-inch painting dates from around 1500 and shows Christ dressed in Renaissance-style robes, his right hand raised in blessing as his left hand holds a crystal sphere.The paintings history is as mysterious as Jesus enigmatic gaze, which invites comparison to a better-known Da Vinci work the Mona Lisa.Salvator Mundi was owned by King Charles I of England in the mid-1600s and was auctioned by the son of the Duke of Buckingham in 1763.It then disappeared from view until 1900, when it resurfaced and was acquired by a British collector. At the time, it was thought to be a work of a Da Vinci disciple, rather than the master himself.ADVERTISEMENTThe painting was sold again in 1958 and then acquired in 2005, badly damaged and partly painted over, by a consortium of art dealers who paid less than $10,000.They restored the painting extensively and documented its authenticity as a work by Da Vinci. The works current owner is Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million in a private sale that became the subject of a continuing lawsuit.Christies said a majority of scholars believe it is a work by Da Vinci, though some have questioned that determination while others have said it was so extensively restored that it is probably more akin to a copy than an original.In New York, where no museum owns a Da Vinci, art lovers lined up outside Christies Rockefeller Center headquarters on Tuesday to view Salvator Mundi.Inside, Christs face seemed to light up the darkened gallery.Svetla Nikolova, who is from Bulgaria but lives in New York now, called the painting spectacular.Its a once in a lifetime experience, she said. It should be seen. Its wonderful its in New York. Im so lucky to be in New York at this time.Una Dora Copley, an artist herself, said Salvator Mundi was worth the hour-plus wait.

Export is going to be quite a big market soon.White, beardy hipster guysAs South African craft beer takes the first steps to establish itself abroad, hand-made ales are surging in popularity at home, becoming a niche premium market.ADVERTISEMENTCurrently just three percent of beers sold come from craft brewers but that figure has more than tripled since 2013 and is expected to grow to 10 percent by 2022, according to industry statistics. In the US, craft beer has reached 21 percent market share.One key to securing domestic success will be tapping into the booming black middle class.The industry is still very white, beardy hipster guys, said Tsikwe Molobye, 32, who runs the Stimela craft brand.Ive had moments at festivals where a person would say But youre black, what do you know about beer? Im thick-skinned.Despite the challenges, his dream is to develop a beer that will appeal to black professionals like himself who have been aggressively marketed premium products like champagne but have had little exposure to craft ale.Local brewers are also seeking to attract beer aficionados and tourists with their quirky brewery concepts.Johannesburg is home to Africas first airport brewery which is run by the Skosana family, and opened its doors to passengers in 2015.The on-site brewery, within sight of passing aircraft, makes 3,000 litres of craft beers a month that include porters, IPAs, blondes and pilsners.Even the landlord was excited ahead of the opening, said the brewerys chairman, Brian Skosana, 57.The Zwakala brewery in Limpopo is also a tourist hotspot and sits in the heart of a region popular with visitors from home and abroad.Bandwagon jumpersWe get quite a lot of Americans coming through here and quite a lot of Dutch tourists stopping. It is a market we want to target, said Tooley.Greta Edwards, 67, was brought to the brewery by her husband to celebrate her birthday.Its very much a draw for overseas visitors. Its like tasting French champagne against sparkling wine, she said.But all that glisters is not gold, warned Lucy Corne who runs the Brewmistress blog that chronicles the highs and lows of the South African beer industry.There are approximately 200 breweries in South Africa now, and if I walked into a store with beers from all of them, I would probably risk my money on a maximum 50 of them, she said.Major brewers also threaten to muscle in on the untapped market.Dutch beer giant Heineken recently snapped up one of South Africas most iconic craft brands, Soweto Gold.Not to be outdone, SAB has developed its own range of craft beers.At one of its giant brewing sites outside Johannesburg, brew master Warren Wiese prides himself of the trio of craft beers that he brews manually unlike their lager stablemates.Our beers are different enough that they stand out, nice enough that if you are into craft beer you can still appreciate them  and if you are new to craft beer it is a nice stepping stone, he said.While SAB has deep pockets to experiment and develop its answer to the craft phenomenon, Corne sounded a note of caution for start-up opportunists looking to cash in.There are also the bandwagon jumpers who are like everyone is opening a craft brewery, Ill do the same, she said. Those guys arent going to survive.",South Africa craft beers brew up a challenge to old order

EAS members demanded that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.ADVERTISEMENTTheir statement came as South Korean President Moon Jae In told reporters it would not be easy for Pyongyang to destroy its nuclear arsenal quickly, saying: If talks begin to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue, I feel it will be realistically difficult for North Korea to completely destroy its nuclear capabilities when its nuclear and missile arsenals are at a developed stage.If so, North Koreas nuclear programme should be suspended, and negotiations could go on to pursue complete denuclearisation.Pyongyang has vowed never to give up its nuclear weapons.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte did not mince words, telling a press conference at the end of the summit that North Koreas missile tests were a concern to every leader at the meetings.People should pray that there is no conflict on the Korean peninsula, he said, adding that Pyongyang was toying with bombs.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the EAS that Singapore strongly condemns recent provocations by North Korea, including its recent nuclear test. He was using the abbreviation for North Koreas official name.These actions pose a severe threat to regional peace, security and stability. Any miscalculation by any party will have very serious consequences, Lee added.He also urged Pyongyang to desist from its provocations and abide by its international obligations and commitments.ADVERTISEMENTThere is no easy or quick solution to the issue. We need a combination of pressure and dialogue among all stakeholders to make progress on this delicate situation, Lee said.UN Security Council resolutions ban imports of coal, textiles and seafood from North Korea, and limit exports of crude oil and petroleum to the country. Sanctions also include calls to not grant work permits for North Korean workers.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters in Manila that he had a frank exchange of views on the issue with fellow leaders.Soon, the severe winter will start in North Korea, and we have agreed to keep a close eye on the effect of sanctions, he added.Maximum pressure should be placed so we can create a situation where North Korea can take the initiative and change its ways.Trump skipped the EAS proper because earlier meetings overran, but delivered his prepared remarks at a lunch with leaders before he left.He later told reporters aboard Air Force One: Its been a great trip. Its also been really good, in terms of North Korea and getting everybody together. I think their acts are all together.",East Asia Summit members seek to put pressure on Pyongyang

Chan School of Public Health.Many past studies have examined the role of eating nuts on peoples health.Researchers said this one stands out due to its size and the way it looked at the association between specific types of nuts and major cardiovascular events.However, because it was an observational study based on self-reported questionnaire responses, it was unable to prove cause-and-effect.Ideally, further investigations should test the effects of long-term consumption of nuts supplemented into the usual diet on hard cardiometabolic events, said an accompanying editorial by Emilio Ros, a doctor at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona.ADVERTISEMENTIn the meantime, raw nuts, if possible unpeeled and otherwise unprocessed, may be considered as natural health capsules that can be easily incorporated into any heart-protective diet to further cardiovascular well-being and promote healthy aging. /cbb",Eating variety of nuts linked to lower heart disease risk

1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Nothing is disposable for him. Soda bottle caps, old canvas, sacks, almost anything can give life to his art. He can be found working in his studio cum gallery, Bliss on Bliss Art Projects, in Sunnyside, New York, or supervising exhibits of upcoming and established artists. You can also catch him in one of his exhibits in many parts of the world.Meet New York-based Ged Merino, an artist who never thought of becoming one. He does not join art competitions, yet he has become a celebrated artist.As a child, Geds inclination towards arts was developed thanks to his parents. His mothers creativeness emerged in repurposing or reusing materials, like old sacks transformed into other objects; while his father, a natural storyteller, took him and his siblings to the farm during weekends to explore.ADVERTISEMENTI loved to draw. My father bought me art materials. My mother took me to art classes, Ged recalls.Artist in New YorkLater, Ged found his calling. He took fine arts at Philippine Womens University (PWU) where he became a student of Manuel Boy Rodriguez Jr., a multi-awarded artist who became his mentor. Boy Rodriguez is the son of the Father of the Philippine Printmaking, Manuel Rodriguez Sr.In 1987 Ged was awarded the Jackson Pollock Memorial Scholarship to study at Arts Student League in New York. While studying, he apprenticed with Rodriguezs brother who worked on mono prints. His plan to stay for only a year abroad became permanent.After taking a printmaking class, Ged started experimenting. For quite some time he painted and worked with printmaking and textiles.After four months, I met a gallerist in Chicago and later in Soho who later represented me, Ged explains.The art scene in New York was very different in the late 70s, say Ged. Graffiti art and messages such as AIDS awareness were splashed everywhere, including subway cars. Bronx-born hip hop music was an anthem, while SoHo became the meeting place of artists including Andy Warhol, who influenced the Pop Art movement.Ged assimilated in the changing art scene in New York, making him understand the good and bad sides of the city. He says that the thousands of artists from all over the world, including local artists, make the art scene robust with various forms and disciplinesADVERTISEMENTGed is currently working on textile-based works augmented by painting and printmaking and sculpture, a medium that is not much explored yet.Bliss on Bliss Art ProjectsNew York has been an artists haven but does not have enough space to accommodate talented emerging artists.Around 2009 I started meeting a lot of local artists, including Pinoys who lived and worked around or near my studio. I realized, especially for Filipino artists, there were not really many places that they could present work, Ged says.In October 2011, Ged launched the Bliss and Bliss Art Projects, an alternative art space for emerging, mid-career and established contemporary artists where they can create and exhibit their works. His wife, Carolina, is the co-founding director.Although it was difficult from the start due to lack of funds, support from family and the Filipino art community started coming in. Among the prominent artists who are supporting Bliss are Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, Lav Diaz, and New York-based writers Jessica Hagedorn and Ninotchka Rosca.When an artist applies to hold an exhibit, Ged and a committee of artists evaluate the applicants portfolio to ensure that only quality works will be exhibited. Prominent Filipino artists like Noel El Farol, Mervy Pueblo, Jeho Bitancor, Bob Nuestro, Eric Zamuco, Mideo Cruz, Luis H. Francia and Jojo Austria have done exhibits at the Bliss.Bliss is Filipino-centric and cross-cultural. Artists, writers and musicians meet up and have dialogues, sometimes leading to collaborations. I have also witnessed how some artists develop new work. We had a jazz band perform before they released their CD, to get inputs from the guests. It is an intimate space where both artists and guest interact freely, Ged explains.Starving artist mythEvery artist has a strong attachment to his/her work and oftentimes finds it difficult to price an artwork. Hence, a gallery assesses each work for the price. Usually, established artists command high prices, but Ged has seen emerging artists sell out most of their works even before the exhibits started.Ged does not charge the artists or ask for commission when an artwork is sold.I just ask them to be in charge of the reception and everything they need for their exhibits, he explains.He does not believe in the starving artist stereotype. He stresses that many artists work because they love what they do and selling is not the only goal.Artists must understand the business side of their work. It is a useful skill that today I might say being an artist is a fulfilling job, Ged says.Ged recently collaborated with Aze Ong, a Philippine-based artist who uses crochet as a medium. They exhibited in a group show at The Drawing Room Contemporary called Common Threads.In October 2016, they launched The GedAze Project with a show at Bliss on Bliss Art. They had five collaborative shows in 2017, four in Manila and at Topaz Arts NY entitled Open Threads last September 16-October 28.Despite having been an artist for decades, Ged still feels like starting again whenever he travels and has exhibits in any country.Traveling enriches my experiences, which translates into my art. Being open to learning no matter what stage in your career is essential to ones developments, Ged concludes.Ged Merino is set to do series of exhibitions in Manila with the GedAze Project with Aze Ong in January 2018.",Fil-Am artist opens gallery to showcase compatriots works

It is considered to be the first Philippine modernist play because of the context of the story.

Radical climate and geographical changes, destroyed civilizations and human mutations lie in its aftermath.The inquisition in the play unfolds in a post-global nuclear holocaust. Serapya, the protagonist, belongs to a beggars trope, receiving alms from luckier survivors who run other more successful federations. Her group, known as Cirque Atomique, is a gypsy-like crew performing to patrons who can pay in cash orin kind. The ragtag motley crew scavenge their costumes and props from museums and galleries. The new order has spawned chaos and cynicism of the law of societies and the very fabric of its smallest unit, the family.Paglilitis ni Aling Serapya will be held at the James B. Reuter Theatre in St. Paul University Quezon City on December 1 and 2. The first show starts at 3 p.m. and the second show at 6 p.m. More information about the play is posted on Ang Paglilitis ni Aling Serapya on its official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages.","The Trial of Humanity Comes this December with ""Ang Paglilitis ni Aling Serapya"""

This years Finals was a rematch of last years, with Samsung coming back for revenge with the exact same lineup. This year also held a lot on the line; could Faker win his 4th title and prove once again that he is the best player in the world? Could SKT prove everyone wrong again that despite their flaws, they were still the best team in the world? Could Samsung get revenge against SKT for last year? Could Ambition, who was the first midlaner Faker had to dominate in his debut to become the legend he is now, get revenge? All of these questions were answered in a dominating performance by Samsung Galaxy.Game 1Samsungs game plan was clear: focus on Faker. With Crown picking up Malzahar in the first pick phase and banning out Syndra and Taliyah, they forced Faker on his Cassiopeia. The early matchup went as you would expect, the early harass from Malz outclassed that of Cass. Coupled with jungle pressure from Ambition and superior vision control, Samsung took control of the early game. SKT wouldnt go down that easy though, and for 20 minutes both teams were at a stalemate.The first big fight, and the first blood, came in at 22 minutes when Samsung started Baron and Peanut Body Slamming in with the steal. Samsung were quick to answer though, picking up four big kills. From there, it was all about maintaining the lead and maintaining map control. Samsung were able to snowball to victory, only conceding one turret in an almost-perfect game. In an episode of The Breakdown, Zirene touched on Samsungs ability to win games without fighting, and that style was on display in Game 1.Game 2SKT opted to remain on the red side to prepare counter picks against Samsung. With Huni locking in Yasuo into Cuvees Gnar, League fans all over the world got pumped for Game 2. But Samsung had the momentum, and shifter into the next gear. Upping the tempo, Ambition on Jarvan IV was able to make successful early game ganks and helped Samsungs bot lane get the lead over SKTs bot lane, arguably SKTs weakest link. Once more, with their superior macro, Samsung were able to run circles around SKT. In a teamfight near the Dragon Pit around the 20-minute mark, Samsung ace SKT and go for the Baron.Game 3Backs against the wall, SKT decide to switch it up. Wolf picks up Leona and Faker on Karma for the Ardent Censer backup. They round it out with Trundle and Gragas for the frontline, and Tristana for the damage. Samsung go with the Chogath and Sejuani frontline, Varus and Lulu botlane, and put Crown back on Malzahar. Things seem to go SKTs way, with the early game going better for them than the past two games. One big factor was Blank subbing in for Peanut, and with his more aggressive early game, helped Huni and Faker get early kills. SKT upped their vision control and tat did wonders for them. By the 15 minute mark SKT were up 2k gold and 3 kills. By adapting and matching SSGs control, SKT managed to secure four elemental Drakes.As SKT siege down the mid lane, Blank aggressively engages under the tower and SSG pick him off. This helped SSG put a finger back on the wheel, and a huge 3-for-nothing teamfight near the Baron pit put them back in full control. With the Baron buff SSG come crashing into the mid lane and demolish SKTs base, leaving the Nexus exposed. SKT manage to hold on however, as Huni manages to fend off and kill 3 Samung members. SKT then secure a huge Elder Dragon, and stall out the game for the time being.No one was prepared for what happened next. Ruler on Varus flashes in for the Corrupting Chains onto Faker, and SSG pick him off. With the Demon King finally down, Samsung rampage through the mid lane, nigh unstoppable. In 40 minutes, they do what no team has ever done; take down the Gods and cement their own legacy, with the Summoners Cup held high above their heads in glory.Feature image from the LoL Esports Flickr page.","Samsung Galaxy etch their names in history, take down the legendary SK Telecom T1 3-0 to win Worlds 2017 - Esports by Inquirer"
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Chito Narvasas days as the PBA commissioner are coming to an end.Seven PBA governors convened on a special board meeting Thursday morning at the league office in Libis and agreed to no longer endorse the renewal of term of the beleaguered executive.Incoming PBA chairman Ramoncito Fernandez of NLEX led the symposium with the majority of the Board of Governors, which addressed the situation that has hounded the league in the past weeks and ultimately opted to not support the extension of Narvasas commissionership.Its not the trade issue anymore. Its simply about lost of confidence, said Fernandez.The league was put on a bad light following Narvasas approval of the controversial deal between San Miguel and Kia, which sent the Picantos 2017 first rounder, which turned out to be top overall selection Christian Standhardinger, to the Beermen in exchange for Ronald Tubid, JayR Reyes, Rashawn McCarthy, and their 2019 first rounder.Several teams have denounced the decision, especially TNT which issued a statement that cast doubt on Narvasas capabilities as the leagues chief and asked him to abdicate his post.If the commissioner does not see this simple perspective, he may not be the right person for the job. We are afraid as to who should be the custodian of the PBAs overall paramount interest. He talks about parity/ equilibrium for trades, but where is it?, the team said in a statement issued on Sunday.The governors met a week before the league goes to its annual planning in Los Angeles on November 10.Officials from the SMC bloc, GlobalPort, and Kia were a no-show in the board meeting.I tried to call them up but there was no reply, Fernandez said.Deputy commissioner Rickie Santos has been appointed as officer-in-charge and caretaker to ensure continuity of league operations until two-thirds of the Board vote on who to install as the leagues new commissioner.",PBA board opts not to renew Narvasas term as commissioner

San Miguels clearly the best team in the league. I wish San Miguel has a weakness but they dont. So our job, the rest of us coaches, is try to find a way, but its not gonna be being taller than San Miguel. So well just work and try to make a way.Its going to be nice to see June Mar and Christian play together, but my tweet was specifically for the Gilas program, shared TNT coach Nash Racela. I was hoping to see them play together in Gilas but it will happen in the PBA with San Miguel. This just makes it harder for all the other teams.The job gets harder because the disparity just got wider. Thats going to be our task, to compete with teams as strong as San Miguel, said new Phoenix coach Louie Alas.Meanwhile, NLEX coach Yeng Guiao said that the controversy surrounding the trade between Kia and San Miguel casts the PBA in a bad light.Im saddened more than angered. Im just sad over the situation because everyone who I talked to had some misgivings about the situation, and I cant explain it enough because Im also part of the PBA, he said.The Beermen acquired the Picantos top overall pick in this years annual rookie selection in exchange for Ronald Tubid, JayR Reyes, Rashawn McCarthy, and a 2019 first round pick, a deal which PBA commissioner Chito Narvasa green-lighted on Friday.We have an intelligent basketball public. They know whats happening. The sad thing for me is weve already been judged, he said.Now the only thing left to do for the 11 other teams in the PBA is to be on their 100-percent or more whenever they play San Miguel.Maybe its time to move on. The more we give reasons, the more the people will be angered. We just have to live with that, he said.",Coaches admit jobs get tougher after Beermen nab Standhardinger

Im happy because Im going to a team where I feel I can contribute.Potts said that going into the draft day, he felt like Rain or Shine, Phoenix, and TNT had their eyes on him.But as the first round past him by and other names were called before him, he had a sense that Alaska will be the team to take him from the pool.I knew something in my gut that I will go to Alaska. After certain teams passed on me, I knew me going to Alaska really made a lot of sense, he said.Potts and fifth overall pick Jeron Teng were the lone rookies selections by Aces in the annual draft proceedings and the two will be expected fill the shoes left by retirees Dondon Hontiveros and Tony dela Cruz.Basically, Alaskas picks were programmed on getting players of high value to them. They need rookies who can help them when it comes to offense, and well try our best trying to fill those positions, said Potss.Potts also likes the potential partnership with Teng and lead Alaska forward Calvin Abueva which can pose as a matchup nightmare for the opposing teams.We can have a team which has some scary speed and power. We have a great mixture and I feel we kind of solidified our backcourt. I feel we could build a dynasty now, he said.",Drop in draft blessing in disguise for Davon Potts as he joins Aces

What we need here is to play aggressive for the whole 48 minutes, he said, likening his approach to how he handled his last head coaching job in Letran. You cant go wrong when youre aggressive, but what we need is controlled aggression.Alas said Phoenix already has the tools to compete in the league with the trio of Matthew Wright, Jeff Chan, and JC Intal in tow, but hes hoping to get significant contributions for their rookies.I believe we are three good pieces away from contending. Hopefully, the ones we picked will fill up the roles we expect from them, he said.Looking back to the dismal at the franchises dismal had last season, Alas is putting those performances behind with Phoenix hell-bent on making an impact this year.We mean business, he vowed.

Her underwear and shorts were on the ground beside her.ADVERTISEMENTCamas body was discovered in an abandoned office building around 100 meters away from her house in a private compound on Ortigas Avenue Extension in Barangay Rosario around 12:20 p.m. on Sunday.Hours before, someone had tried to burn down the building, prompting residents to put it out. But since no one went inside the building, it took several hours before the victim was found.According to Barangay Rosario Executive Officer Floriezel Santos, Cama was reported missing by her father Reynaldo on Saturday morning after she failed to come home on Friday night.Santos said Cama was last spotted by a neighbor knocking on the door of her house around 11 p.m. on Friday. No one, however, opened the door.The Inquirer tried to interview the victims family, but they declined.The Pasig police said at least two suspects have been identified based on the account of witnesses.One of the witnesses said he saw two men standing near the victim as she was knocking on the door of her house on Friday night.The witness also claimed he saw the two men near the crime scene on Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTSantos, however, did not identify the suspects although he said he was 80 to 90 percent sure that these were the ones involved in the crime.The suspects are possibly drug addicts.

Gwendolyn Garcia said this to describe the move of 12 mayors under the Liberal Party and other local government officials under One Cebu party to switch to the Partido Demokratiko PilipinoLakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban).ADVERTISEMENTThe Garcia clan founded the One Cebu party. Rep. Garcia leads the party today.One Cebu Party, the original coalition partner of PDP-Laban in Cebu since the May 2016 elections, welcomes to the fold of President Rodrigo Roa Dutertes coalition for genuine change, the thousands of officials and leaders who will take their oaths as members of PDP-Laban on Friday (November 17), said Garcia in a statement, where she also announced another batch of mayors from the One Cebu party to take their oath as new members of the PDP-Laban party.Garcia, who is a former Cebu governor, said that the developments in the local political arena in Cebu meant a newfound unity.This newfound unity can only be good for Cebu. One Cebu was founded in the year 2007 to consolidate the unprecedented political unity in the Province of Cebu. One Cebu is hopeful that this mass oath taking will once again usher in a new era of political unity in the province, she said in a statement.Garcias announcement came after Cebu Gov. Hilario Davide III confirmed reports that 12 LP mayors from the 2nd and 7th districts of Cebu would switch parties.They were scheduled to take their oaths on November 17 in a mass oathtaking.Last August 16, 2016, at least 300 politicians of Cebu province belonging to the United Nationalist Alliance Party (UNA) and the Liberal Party (LP) swore their allegiance to the PDP-Laban in a mass oathtaking.One Cebu initially formed allegiance with UNA, but in April 2016, a few weeks before the May 2016 National Elections, they switched to PDP-Laban in support of President Duterte.Out of the 53 local government units that make up Cebu, at least 11 towns (Alcoy, Asturias, Balamban, Barili, Borbon, Liloan, Malabuyoc, Moalboal, Pilar, Pinamungajan and Santa Fe) are currently governed by local chief executives who ran under One Cebu.Some of whom had already switched their alliance to the PDP-Laban as they joined the mass-oathtaking to the President Dutertes party last August 2016.Balamban Mayor Ace Binghay, who run under One Cebu, confirmed in a text message that he had already been a PDP-Laban member since August 2016.Move welcomedMeanwhile, Garcia, in a statement, also said One Cebu welcomed the decision of at least 12 mayors from the southern towns of Cebu to switch from Liberal Party (LP) to PDP-Laban.We fully support the political master stroke of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, Secretary General of PDP-Laban; and Presidential Assistant for the Visayas, Secretary Michael Dino, in consolidating all political forces that, after the May 2016 elections, have now seen the light and switched their support from their old parties and loyalties to the administration of President Duterte and PDP-Laban, said Garcia in a statement.Davide and supportWhen asked about the possibility of losing the support of the LP mayors who switched parties despite their assurance of supporting Governor Davide, a staff member from the Capitols Public Information Office (PIO) said that the governor would issue his statement about this statement today (Wednesday).Davide, who confirmed on Monday the move of the 12 LP-allied mayors from the second and seventh districts of Cebu to the PDP-Laban party earlier, said that they assured him of their support despite being members of the PDP-Laban party.But with the alliance formed between PDP-Laban and One Cebu, it is possible for the former LP mayors to shift their support from Davide, to the official the PDP-Laban would choose.Wait for directionsTuburan Mayor Democrito Diamante, who is also the president of the League of the Municipalities of the Philippines-Cebu Chapter (LMP-Cebu), said in a phone interview that they would have to wait for directions from the national officers of the PDP-Laban party about this matter.Diamante, who switched from LP to PDP-Laban last June 2017, earlier said that he assured Davide of his backing in the elections.As new members of the party, we are expected to carry out what is instructed to us by the national officers of PDP-Laban. We will wait for their directives, said Diamante yesterday.The shifting of alliances, however, is not a new thing in Cebus political scene.It can be recalled that majority of Cebus mayors, both in the cities and the municipalities, shifted from former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyos Lakas-Kampi to LP after the 2010 elections where LP presidential candidate, Benigno Aquino III won and was declared as the president of the country.",Rep.

The rains also upped the danger faced by residents in the landslide-stricken areas of this fifth-class municipality, some 105 kilometers from Cebu City.Ruben Niere, Boljoons public information officer, told Cebu Daily News by phone yesterday that the rains also prompted authorities to halt clearing operations on the landslide-hit 15-km-long BecerrilNug-as Road in Barangay Lower Becerril that connected Barangay Poblacion to the mountain barangays of Lower Becerril, Upper Becerril, Lunop, Nangka and San Antonio. Barangay Poblacion and the five mountain villages are now under a state of calamity.ADVERTISEMENTThe diversion road, which is located 20 meters away from the now-closed BecerrilNug-as Road, was opened last November 8 by the municipal government with the help of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO), the Department of Public Works and Highways in Central Visayas (DPWH-7), Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (Opav) and the local governments of Oslob and Dalaguete.Boljoon has been experiencing bad weather since (Monday). Thats why we instructed our personnel doing the clearing operations up there to stop since the ground is so saturated with rainwater. Its too muddy and we need to avoid our heavy equipment from slipping and being buried completely in the mud, Niere said.The ground beneath the diversion road is too soft for heavier vehicles to pass through. Only motorcycles are allowed to traverse it, he added.The series of landslides, which first struck Sitio Sangi in Barangay Lower Becerril on October 27, were attributed to the softening of soil brought about by days of continuous rain. The continued movement of the land has so far displaced at least 55 families (270 individuals) residing in three of Lower Becerrils sub-villages: Sitios Sangi, Camp Franco and Upper Cansiloy.Due to the unpredictable nature of landslide, the PDRRMO also advised the local government of Boljoon to implement a forced and massive evacuation of more families in other affected areas.Boljoon Mayor Merlou Derama said they had difficulty convincing the other affected residents (37 families, 150 individuals) to leave their homes and may just forcibly evacuate them.Niere, however, said they have yet to implement the evacuation scheme despite the heavy rains experienced in the last two days.We have our disaster team on standby in the area, 24/7, in case the need to evacuate the remaining families will arise.

Bacalso Ave.According to Cebu City Transportation Office (CCTO) operations head Francisco Ouano, heavy traffic was observed in the construction site in the intersection of N. Bacalso Ave. and F. Llamas St. from 7 a.m. to 9:30 am.However, he said it became moderate after 9:30 am.As of 5 p.m. yesterday, he said traffic was also moderate.The reason why traffic was heavy in the morning was there were a lot of vehicles. Others were also surprised, they did not know about the scheduled closure. But in one week, I think the situation will improve as they will be able to adjust already, he said.All three lanes of the southbound side of N. Bacalso Ave. in front of McDonalds have been closed to give way to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 7 and their contractor to work on the next phase of the underpass project.On the other side, only one lane of the northbound side of the road, in front of Shopwise, is opened for vehicles.Alternative roads include Ma. Gochan St., Avocado St. and Ganciang St. for those going to the south.For those going north, they can also take Cabreros St. and Tagunol St.Ouano said they would continue to closely monitor the traffic situation in the area today and for the rest of the week.The closure would continue and there would be no changes, he added.The closure will continue for the next three months or so.For his part, Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmea asked for patience from the public regarding the project.We have to do it.

Because if we delay it some more, that would escape the problem, he said.The mayor said that the project should have been done years ago when traffic was not that bad, but he said, I was not mayor then.Aside from students, tricycle drivers also shared their irritation on the traffic jams caused by the project.Loloy Sanchez, who says he has been a tricycle driver since young and have used his income to support his family, said he has been losing money since the project started.Dako kaayo nga kita ang akong nawagtang tungod aning sige og traffic (I lost a lot of profit due to the frequent traffic jams), Sanchez said.Naka graduate gud akong anak og college tungod aning akong pag tricycle (My child has graduated in college due to the monetary support he gets from my driving services), Sanchez said.He added Maayo kung ma pas-pasan ni nila kay gamay ra jud ang akong makuha nga kita kay gamay ra ang manakay ( It would be good if they speed up the construction a little bit because I dont profit that much due to lack of passengers).But not all have been inconvenienced by the project.Marvin Boyles, a habal-habal driver said that business has been good since a lot of people have been using motorcycles for hire to beat the traffic.Sa karon, daghan kaayog manakay og habal-habal, lipay ra sad mi kay dako mig makuha (So far, there are a lot of people that ride the habal-habal, were just happy because we are getting a big amount of money), Boyles said.Rolly Montejo, a Citom traffic enforcer assigned in the area, said that the traffic on yesterday was by far the worst compared to the previous incidents.Ikumpara nimo sa mga ning agi nga adlaw dayon sa karon, mas bintaha tong sa mga ning agi nga adlaw (If you compare the previous days to todays traffic, the previous ones were far less horrible), Montejo said.Montejo advised commuters that in order for them to be able to arrive early to where they are heading, they should head out earlier than the time where traffic congestion is expected.Montejo also said to lessen the traffic, drivers should also observe traffic rules.Usahay kaning mga driver di magpatuo, mag iluganay sa agi-anan, mao nuon nay maka dalag traffic aside sa construction (Sometimes, these drivers dont adhere to the traffic rules, they often fight over who would go first in lanes, that cause traffic congestion aside from the construction). /With a report from Correspondent Doris Mae Mondragon","Commuters, motorists endure N.

So maghihintay muna tayo ng recommendation (We have not yet received information about the proposal. So we will just first wait for the recommendation), said CCPO director Senior Supt.

Jose Mario Espino whether or not to agree with the mayors proposal.Doria, however, expressed support for Osmeas planned liquor ban contained in a draft executive order titled An Order Regulating Business Establishments and Vendors During Sinulog Festival 2018, which aims to avoid a repeat of the previous years alcohol-soaked parties that left people sleeping off their hangover on the streets.Lesson learned din yun base sa experience natin at ni mayor na merong mga nag-complain na mga nanunuod lang pero parang nahirapan sila kasi maraming unruly crowd and nagiinuman na sa kalsada (This is also a lesson learned for us and the mayor based on our experience with complaints from those who had a hard time watching the festivities because of the unruly crowd and all the drinking that went on by the road), said Doria.",Sinulog Foundation executive okays shutdown of cell sites

It will then be submitted to the City Council for approval.",Cebu City dad pushes bid to increase taxes on banks

It was a respite, a quick escape.The show starts after your dinner, we were told, and immediately ensconced in a private dining area.I had been in this same room months earlier for a Cebu Pacific event, and it felt different without the crowd.I could now make out the beautiful view of the business hub and its halogen glow in the quiet through the glass that surrounded us.We ordered the Whiskey Sour, a personal favorite, to welcome the steady stream of food: marinated mushrooms, garlic shrimp, a tomato bouillabaisse with basil, Italian meatballs, indulgent truffled fries, and a rich mussels mariniere.We lingered a bit at the jamon serrano bruschetta, myself taking on Manny Os role as I informed my companions that the thinly-sliced cured pork isa Spanish classic and stored in sheds called secaderos at high altitudes, giving them the moniker mountain ham.The rice dish arrived, aptly named the Paella Eivissa, christened for the Catalan version of Ibiza.For those craving heft (I was in the company of two growing boys, after all), we were also served the 250g US Angus Super Burger, a perennial crowd pleaser.But Micah Dizon-Hontiveros, wife of Cebuano hotshot Dondon Hontiveros, and skilled in the kitchen because she is from Pampanga (one of the rare times we play happily into these stereotypes), agrees on my favorite on the menu: the signature spaghetti carbonara, an Ibiza Beach Club original.Unsurprisingly, it is the simplest dish that catches my attention.Traditionally made from raw eggs, cheese and pancetta (Italian ham), this version is distinctly Filipino with the addition of cream, inventively served up in an eggshell, cracked on top and filled with rich sauce.Pouring it on top of the spaghetti becomes quite the experience, involving the diner in the preparation of the dish.It is also, I surmise, a sophisticated take on on the side, for the diner who prefers his carbonara pristinely Italian, hold the creamand just my raw egg please.

Should it happen, it would obviously kill most of life on Earth.Warming of 6 C exceeds mainstream projections, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) has previously warned it is possible if nothing is done to reverse the rise of greenhouse-gas emissions.Many scientists say that if this temperature is ever reached, it could result from unbridled carbon emissions over a very long period  or from a tipping point such as the release of methane gas from melting permafrost, which would cause warming to accelerate at a stroke.UN members negotiating a climate rescue pact in Le Bourget have embraced a goal of limiting global warming to 2 C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels, or less.Last month, Britains weather office said 2015 was on track to hit the halfway, 1 C, mark.The UNs climate science panel, considered the authority on the subject, has said the globe could become 4.8 C warmer this century on worst-case-scenario greenhouse gas emission trends.The message from this study is that there may be another disaster approaching us as a consequence of global warming, and it may be much worse than all other consequences identified previously, co-author Sergei Petrovskii told AFP.There may be very little warning signs before the disaster actually happens but once the critical threshold is passed (as estimated at 6 C), then the catastrophe will develop fast, he explained by email.The team said research into the effects of warming on oceans so far had focused on sea level rise and species loss.Their study was based on mathematical modelling, rather than observational research, and the authors acknowledged they did not factor in certain natural processes, such as ocean circulation, which could influence the outcome.But, they said, if carbon emissions remain unchecked, deoxygenation is ultimately not a risk to be dismissed.The danger is probably more real than to be drowned, they wrote.",Warming to deprive us of oxygen  study

Cobrado joined the farming industry at the age of 15. Now 40, Cobrado shared the challenges he faced during his career in farming.The problem we usually encounter is the changing of weather. Sometimes we experience typhoons and they result in premature growth of our crops, Cobrado said in Cebuano.In line with this years theme, Tribunalo introduced urban gardening to the city as a project for urban areas to be self-reliant.The project was started by the city agriculture department in July 17, 2017. Ronilo Montejo, a city agriculturist, said the city government distributed fruits and vegetable seeds to the 32 urban barangays and taught them ways to plant the seeds and cultivate them.Ten out of the 32 barangays participated in the booth display.Gipa ila-ila mi og mga nagkalain-laing mga pamaagi sa pagtanom. Adunay bag-o nga method nga Toms newspaper nga mag-utilize og mga recycable nga mga gamit nga kasagaran ilabay ra sa mga residente (We were introduced to many ways in farming. We have this new method called Toms newspaper which utilizes recyclable items that are often thrown out by residents), Montejo said.Montejo also said the project is like hitting two birds with one stone because it does not only help people create their own food but also reduce the garbage problem in urban barangays.Tribulano, the head of the event, encourages the public to come and visit the fair at Plaza Sugbo and support the livelihood of local farmers. The event will formally close on November 10.","Farmers Day kicks off with floats, booths"

Written by Margaret Atwood, Alias Grace follows the story of Grace Marks, an Irish immigrant who becomes a domestic servant in Canada. In 1843, Grace is convicted of murdering her employer with co-worker, James McDermott.However, some of Graces supporters believe she did not commit the crime, which led them hiring Dr. Simon Jordan to perform a psychiatric evaluation to find out the truth. Aside from the thrilling suspense factor of the show, it also tackles womens issues in the 19th century, some of which are still felt today.AbortionAbortion is focused on in a few episodes. The one that stood out was when Mary Whitney was forced to go to an unlicensed doctor. After the procedure, she spent hours in bed due to the pain until she eventually died after bleeding out. To not taint her reputation, they did not disclose her passing as a result of abortion complications.Sexual assaultSexual assault was brought up many times throughout the show. From sexual advances of employers to being assaulted in an asylum, Alias Grace shows the reality of women in the 19th century that still happen today. The men who were in power treated Grace and the other women with disrespect, like their actions had no consequences.Treating women like objectsAside from sexual assault, scenes of objectifying women are prevalent too. The men ordered women around and would literally throw them across the room. In one episode, Dr. Jordan was frustrated with Grace because she didnt want to talk about certain topics. He pressed on, raising his voice like it would force her to speak.After watching all six episodes, you will start to see how these shows reflect problems that women still face today. Some may not be as drastic but the issue is still there. Now, the question is: When will start to see real change against rape culture and progress in feminism?Art by Lara IntongFollow Preen on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and ViberRelated stories:How Oh Wonder and Kesha Are Singing About Heavy Social IssuesWhy The Handmaids Tale Is the Anti-Woman Series You Need to See Right NowA Few of the Most Sexist Things Our Moms May Have SaidHow Rape Culture Starts with Simple Words",Netflix Series Alias Grace Shows Why Female Oppression Must Stop

1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Let us torture you a little this long weekend with films that feature lots of food. Its the ultimate way to binge-watch if you ask me. You cant watch these movies without eating, hence justifying all the snacks you will be reaching for during your viewing session. Come to think of it, this isnt torture then. Just a creative way to celebrate a cheat day.There are many movies that revolve around food along with documentaries that plunge you neck deep into the industry. But we listed down these seven for a diverse selection in terms of stories and cuisines. Choose one that suits your palate or watch all of them to get a complete foodie experienceRatatouilleYoure craving: Some laughter along with a heartwarming storyJust like the titular soup dish, this animated movie is appropriate to warm up your jaded adult heart. The movie follows Remy, a rat whose sensitive nose and shy character unlikely dominated the world of French cuisine. Roger Ebert gives praise to the film, declaring one of the best that came out in 2007.Julie & JuliaYoure craving: A women empowerment story within the kitchenOften, the kitchen is used to subjugate women. But this story shows how the women who have conquered food counters deal with so much more. Backed by Nora Ephron, the movie follows the story of the famous Julia Child played by Meryl Streep (which for me alone is a reason to watch) and Julie Powell, a blogger who documented her adventures in cooking Julias recipes until it became the book Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen.ChefYoure craving: A modern story with a side of food pornFor something that might hit close to home for those who are never without their social media apps, Chef is something you should watch. Chef Carl Chaveu takes over a food truck in search of foodies and followers after a food review gone wrong. Empire has this to say about the trip, Eat well beforehand or youll be in tummy-rumbling, tongue-hanging-out agony as the merry band cook their way across America.Babettes FeastYoure craving: A classic French course and a universal lessonThis movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and is a staple when it comes to watching your way through French cuisine. The story touches on refugees and being open-minded, done through a stroke of luck and a life-changing feast.Jiro Dreams of SushiYoure craving: A master class on Japanese know-howWe all know how the Japanese take their food seriously. The Japanese cuisine is a mind-blowing art and an exacting science at the same time. This documentary will help you just geek out about this as follows Michelin-starred chef Jiro Ono vis-a-vis sushi techniques and traditions.Eat Drink Man WomanYoure craving: A full course of humanity, using food as metaphorWe communicate by eating, notes one of the characters of this Ang Lee favorite. As a family struggles to stay together while the patriarch suffers from losing his sense of taste, it seems that the meals they have are the only reason they havent imploded just yet. Its a good reflection on how family feasts mean more than just good food shared with our blood relatives.No ReservationsYoure craving: A light snack of romance, without feeling sick to your stomachPlaying on the dream of working in a restaurant in Manhattan, Catherine Zeta-Jones character is the type of chef that doesnt want to act the way women are expected to in the kitchen. On top of this, you get a love story paired with food shots that will definitely make you want more than just popcorn.BurntYoure craving: Some intense dissection of a chefs mindand some Bradley CooperThis film follows the story of Adam Jones, a Michelin-starred chef who hit a slump. Its an intense personal look into how this profession can drain and strain you. It also was created with chefs Gordon Ramsey, Mario Batali, and Marcus Wareing. What youll learn from this film?

1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Many would say that love stories are overplayed by now and that theres nothing new about them anymore. But you have to admit that you dont forget the ones that you enjoy, regardless of how cheesy or seemingly unrealistic they are. When I was tasked to interview author Jennifer E. Smith, I suddenly remembered reading The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight way back in college. It was a long time but the storys main plot felt fresh in my head.Jennifer is known for writing romantic young adult fiction which mostly play on the concept of serendipity and what ifs. Her new book Windfall is no exception. I sat down with her before she started her two-city book signing, and was surprised to find out how she manages to write stories which happen in the span of 24 hours or less. Even more when she said she can write without the help of caffeine. (How?!) Keep scrolling and find out more about her.Out of all the genres and themes, why did you choose to write love stories?Its funny because I never sit down and think that Im going to write a romantic story. The books usually start with a what if question. Like, what if you miss your flight by four minutes and ended up sitting next to the person youre going to end up with? Im really obsessed with moments in time which acts as hinges, days where there are before and after scenariosyesterday your life is different, the next day its another thing.I think love stories are an interesting vehicle to explore that because often there are so many ways your life can be split into two. And meeting the person youre supposed to meet is one of those ways. I try to balance them out too, like I write family stories and other themes as well so theyre not straight-up love stories. But Im a romantic and an optimist, and its kinda fun to explore young love.Have you ever tried to write stories of different genres?I grew up reading mostly realistic stories. Thats just what I was always drawn to as a reader. Some people are just drawn into sci-fi, dystopian, action, thrillers, and whatever they may be. Im always at awe at writers who can jump from one genre to another. I would like to think one day Ill try something wildly different. I think its more likely that if I try something different it would be in terms of form. I would still write realistic fiction but maybe more for adults, younger kids, or a screenplay. I think theres enough drama around me that I need to explore. [Laughs]How did you come with the idea of luck playing into the story of Windfall?Again, its about your life getting bifurcated. Theres not a better example of that happening than someone winning the lottery. Its something that everyone dreams about and its the most amazing thing thats ever going to happen to them. Often it is, but sometimes its not. Theres a lot of not-so-great things that might happen. It also draws a clear line because yesterday, your life was normal, and the day after, everythings different.I love the idea of how Allie, whos in love with her best friend Teddy, buys a ticket as a joke. And then he wins $140 million while they were on the brink of something happening. Its playing with the moments and the aftermath of their journey.What would you do if you won the lottery?After doing a lot of research about it, I dont think I want to. [Laughs] But if I did, Id do a lot more traveling. One of my favorite places is Scotland so I want to buy a little cottage there. And I want to give a lot to charity and help my family. I think thats one of the big themes of the book: doing good deeds, volunteering, grand acts of kindness. The idea that you have the means to make other peoples dreams come true.I really, really love it here.  A post shared by Jennifer E. Smith (@jenniferesmith) on Jul 25, 2017 at 10:34am PDTAre there specific books that inspired you to become an author?Theres so many! I was a huge reader as a kid. I [practically] lived in the library. [Laughs] I cant say any in particularI mean, I loved books that are sad, sweet, and full of heart. As a kid, I read Tuck Everlasting and Bridge to Terabithiaa lot of those heartfelt books. I read really widely and I think you take something from every book that you read.Are there movies or shows that also inspired your work?Absolutely. My books owe a huge debt to the Before Sunrise trilogy. They take place over a short period of time and there are a lot of conversation in real time. I love reading about short intense time periods [and] books with a lot of banter. I also think my books get inspiration from Nora Ephron movies like Youve Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle, and other romantic comedies.Thats why my books like Hello, Goodbye happens in the span of 12 hours. I keep joking that Im going to keep cut it in half until I manage to write a book that takes place in minutes. [Laughs]How do you manage to write a whole novel that happens in short periods of time? Do you keep a timeline?Thats the challenge for me, to make it substantial and meaningful even if it is just a short period. Its really fun! If I could write every book within 24 hours, I would. [Laughs] But Im someone who plots her books ahead of time so I just feel my way whenever I write and to have a time marked off in some way.I also dont keep a timeline. I know its crazy but in the middle of writing a story Ill know all the sense. In general, I dont know how its going to end. But if youre writing a story that only happens in one day, you just know where youre going with the story when you reach it. Often Im worried with the amount of hours I have left [in the story] so I think, Oh gosh they need to move faster. Its kind of a helpful measuring stick.Do you base your stories on personal experiences or theyre secondhand?Its a combination of both. Often, I use my experiences as a jumping off point. I take something that happened to me and make it more interesting. [Laughs] Like Statistical Probability, for example: I once sat next to an old Irish man on a plane from Chicago to Dublin. We chatted the whole way and he was going through the gate for Irish citizens and I was going the other way. I kinda waited and I wasnt sure if he had gone through already. I had to go and didnt see him again. Its kinda crazy that you chatted with somebody for seven hours and never even know their last name and see them again. So I thought that instead of an old Irish man, Ill make him a cute boy.I also try not to base my characters on somebody I know. Just because I do want it to be fiction. But I do borrow from certain aspects of my life.Do you prefer coffee or tea while writing?I just drink water. Im more of a tea person though. Im never the kind of person who doesnt need a jumpstart in the morning.Do you also listen to music when you write?Very occasionally I listen to instrumental music like movie scores. I cant listen to music with words because it gets in my head. I only listen to music when Im working at coffee shops with author friends.If any of your books were to be made into a movie or show, do you have a dream cast for the characters?Its always a hard question to answer because there are younger actors and actresses that are coming out that I dont know. [Laughs] Several of the books are in development for films and you just have to trust the people behind the process that they will pick the best actors. I dont think of my characters that distinctly so it leaves a lot of room and Im fine with a whole range of people [for the roles.] Its more about the heart of the character for me than the looks.Arent you worried about fans who are so specific with how the characters should look?I think the process of a book becoming a movie is just letting go in so many respects. As an author, its reading the script and its different from the book, and it has to be a smooth transition for the screen. Its about realizing that its someone elses vision on top of your own.For fans, its understanding that its a translation of the book and not the book itself. I think its flattering when fans pay attention and are that invested that they notice that level of detail. But I think the priority is to preserve the heart of the project. Im very lucky so far because the people Ive worked with love the stories and just want to make the best movie possible.Art by Lara IntongFollow Preen on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and ViberRelated stories:Young Adult Authors Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian On Fake News and the Perfect Place to WriteSci-Fi Author Pierce on How Womens Rights Would Exist in MarsAuthor Coylee Gamboa on the Secret Side of Filipino-Chinese MarriagesAuthor Samantha Sotto on a Writers Role in the Post-Truth EraWhy The Interestings Author Meg Wolitzer Wrote About Sad Teens",How Author Jennifer E.

1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Every week, Preen tackles motherhood sans the rose-tinted glasses. Our columnists L. Juliano, Marla Darwin, Monica Eleazar-Manzano, Rossana Unson, and Ronna Capili-Bonifacio tell their personal experiences like it isat times frustrating, oftentimes confusing, but always enlightening.We have entered the month of Scorpio. One of my favorite and most trusted astrologers, Gahl Sasson said to become more like a Scorpio this month, no matter what your astrological sign is. The task is to open ourselves to the synchronicities of our daily lives, be curious about magic and the occult. Apparently, deep healing may occur when we become more sensitive to these cosmic forces at play.Scorpio also happens to be the same month of Halloween. In my home, it has always been my sons favorite holiday. Yes, even more than Christmas for some intriguing reason! Perhaps, the lure of mystery and the dark arts amuses him. I have a hunch that my intuitive son, who is an old soul, has lived countless lives, some of which have been connected to the occult, just like me. We have a karmic relationship, after all! So, I try to make it extra special each year for him. This year, aside from introducing him to the most beloved Harry Potter books (on his 10th year, the same age as Harry in the first book), we were also gifted with spirit animal guides. According to the shamans of the world, spirit animal guides are messengers from another realm who choose to come into your life for various reasons.Coincidentally, different animals have been showing up in our home and garden. In the past few weeks, there has been instances of the exact same praying mantis coming to me and hanging out by my side. I even named it Mantis Manzano on my Instagram Stories because it likes to stay on the same spot on the bed as if it were part of our family! They say that the mantis always comes to us when we need peace, quiet and calm in our lives. And I couldnt agree more!One afternoon as I went out for our daily nature walk with my three-year-old daughter, we spotted a huge electric blue salamander by the river. To me, it was pure magic to witness this colorful amphibian in its natural habitat. I instantly knew that the Universe sent me this spirit animal for a lesson. I quickly looked up its meaning and I was surprised to find out that the salamander is a symbol for radical change, a sign to put yourself outside of your comfort zone to embody the animals natural ability for metamorphosis. I embraced this message.We also rescued a newborn kitten out in the field next to our home which then brought her mom and her kitten sibling into our once pet-less home. Of course, my kids have fallen in love with them. We have named the nursing mama cat Frida, one kitten Hamishi (after a book my son likes) and the other one Mayonnaise which was named by my daughter.The last time I owned a cat must have been when I was the same age as my eldest child so I simply dont recall much on domesticating them. This led me to do online research on the wild and adorable furry animals. Apparently, in the spiritual circles, cats are considered very spiritual beings with powerful astral energy. If you are chosen by one, consider yourself blessed. I have read countless articles of cats protecting homes from unwanted spirits and the dreaded evil eye. They are also known to be conduits to the spiritual realms because of their uncanny, supernatural and paranormal abilities.The past month has definitely taught me to be more receptive to Mother Nature and what messages it can bring to my life through its sacred beings. I have surrendered to the healing magic and the witchy arts of the Scorpio.Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author in her private capacity and do not in any way represent the views of Preen.ph, or any other entity of the Inquirer Group of Companies.Art by Lara IntongFollow Preen on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and ViberRelated stories:What to Do With Your Spoiled Child?How Parenting Can Give You a Lesson On MindfulnessYour November Horoscope: Careful, Things Are Not What They SeemWhy I Harness Power from Iconic Women During Major Life Transitions",What Scorpio Season and Spirit Animals Mean for You and Your Family
1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"So the pebble thrown into the ocean of sexual harassment and assault has swelled into a tidal wave, drowning a veritable whos who of Hollywoods most powerful men, from Harvey Weinstein and Brett Ratner to Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey, under the exhaustively investigated and corroborated accusations brought forth by other industries, including fashion and media, have also been engulfed in this tidal wave, and rightly so. For the longest time, each pebble thrown in barely even caused a ripple. In the case of Bill Cosby, more than 60 women have been throwing pebbles in that ocean for 40 years, and a jury still believed, in the case of one of Cosbys accusers, that she had asked for it.Harvey Weinsteins predatory career continues to be exhaustively documented, as scores of women have come forward after decades of keeping fearfully silent, revealing a disconcertingly consistent modus operandi of what Ashley Judd called coercive bargaining. Everyone in the film industry, it seemed, knew about Harvey Weinstein, but no one did anything to stop himuntil now.And recently, it was revealed that Weinstein had hired ex-Mossad spies to dig dirt on his would-be accusers, with some befriending the women and posing as potential collaborators on womens empowerment issues, in order to extract information that could strengthen his arsenal in a negative campaign that would destroy any woman who dared to accuse him publicly. Rose McGowan was the target of one such covert operation.Apart from revealing that Weinstein was a far more disgusting and arrogant pig than was previously imagined, paying operatives particularly known for their ruthlessness shows that he knew exactly what he was doing when he invited actresses and models and female crew members and employees to his hotel room. He knew exactly what he was doing when he asked them if they wanted a massage. He knew exactly what he was doing when he forced them to watch him shower or masturbate into a potted plant.And yet many of these women, for years, believed that no one would believe them if they came forward with their stories, because Harvey Weinstein was too powerful and made too much money for Hollywood and Hollywood had a reputation for coddling power and money and turning a blind eye to sexual harassment and assault.Countless women had to tell their stories to The New York Times and The New Yorker, two of the most respected publications in the world today, hailed for their journalistic comprehensiveness and integrity, before the public took serious notice.Which is great, if a long time coming. The once powerful Harvey Weinstein is now a pariah in the town he once lorded over, and may soon be facing criminal charges.Yet it took SO MANY WOMEN to come forward. Compare that to accusations against Kevin Spacey, another tidal wave in the making. All it took was ONE MAN to come forward with his story of how, in 1986, the then-closeted actor made unwanted sexual advances towards him, a 14-year-old boy performing on Broadway.Anthony Rapp has thanked the women who have come forward with accounts of their own experiences at the hands of sexual predators for empowering him to speak out. It must have been difficult for Rapp, I can imagine, because of the stigma attached to male-on-male sexual assault, which happens, perhaps not at the same frequency as sexual violence against women, and the trauma is just as real, and deep and lasting.Yet there is a marked difference in the way Rapps allegations were greeted by the public. Yes, the repercussions were swift. Spacey immediately issued an apology, and took the opportunity to announce that he was gay. Netflix cancelled the next season of House of Cards, effectively firing Spacey. Ridley Scott decided to re-shoot all of the Kevin Spacey scenes in the soon-to-be released movie, All The Money in the World, replacing him with Christopher Plummer, whomScott now claims was his first choice all along. And more accusations have come to light, lending credence to a pattern of predatory behavior on the part of Spacey.But did anyone stop to ask what Rapp was wearing at the time of the incident? Did anyone wonder if he was drunk when it happened? Or indeed, why he let it happen? If he was coming on to Spacey and asking for it?NO ONE did. Because it didnt have any bearing on the issue. Rapp accused Spacey and he was believed immediately.As @alisongrippo pointed out on Twitter, It took one man to topple Kevin Spacey. 100s of women have come forward about countless men and still we wonder.Are we still going to wonder when the next woman comes forward to accuse another powerful, high-profile man of sexually assaulting her? Are we still going to wonder when allegations of sexual harassment are brought forth by a female employee against her male superior in the workplace? Are we still going to wonder when a young woman found unconscious by a dumpster after a college party claims to be have been raped by a rich, entitled, and white Olympic hopeful studying at an Ivy League university?Or will we listen to her story and believe her?Art by Lara IntongFollow Preen on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and ViberRelated stories:Comedian Louis C.K.

1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"Every week, Preen tackles motherhood sans the rose-tinted glasses. Our columnists L. Juliano, Marla Darwin, Monica Eleazar-Manzano, Rossana Unson, and Ronna Capili-Bonifacio tell their personal experiences like it isat times frustrating, oftentimes confusing, but always enlightening.I hate to say it and as I do, the words are struggling their way out of my mouth barely as a whisper, but youre right. Yes, you who called my child spoiled, you who called her names like may toyo in public. I struggled with anger and played with words to lash out. But after much needed introspection, I actually agree with you.This you is a relative and co-parent I had to live with for a week while on vacation. Things began normally with my three-year-old bonding with his six-year-old girl. My little one is strong willed and I took that as a sign of an empowered child who can voice her concerns and be heard, even at her age. With circumstances at their besta complete nights sleep, on-time nap, and nourishing meals four times a dayshes a gentle sweetheart. She shares her toys, says the magic words (thank you, please, excuse me), greets people she meets with respect, and converses fluently. But change any one from that list and its a different story. She becomes whiny, clingy, and demanding, often out of my control.I would have stood by my childs apparent normal toddler behavior. But then I realized that my relatives backlash was an amplified reaction of the other parents Ive encountered recently. The looks they cast are enough to betray their thoughts. I know, because Ive given the same judgmental stares to other kids I deemed as spoiled brats.The behavior that used to send me nuts enough to call the attention of waiters, and once a flight attendant, to loudly complain within the parents earshot, is the very thing I allowed my child to be. It almost happened overnight. Well, two months.A new business venture opened along with two more book projects on top of my regular work. I couldnt resist the opportunities. It is Christmas season anyway, and I knew that after all the busy days, itll soon die down and I can focus again on caring for my child. I couldnt rely on my husband who was a hundred times more swamped with work than I am. So I gave myself two months. I dropped my daughter off at my in-laws with her yaya during weekdays. Id pick her up usually in her sleep. Often, I used the few hours I have with her to bond with my laptop just to meet deadlines. The same goes for weekends.Slowly, the little tyrant began ordering the helps around. She acted out when she didnt get what she wanted. Shes back to grabbing and no sharing. She perfected her manipulation tactics, lacing her actions with sweet smiles and hugs when she knew whining will not work. And when even that fails, she goes for the ultimate strategy. Crying, and I mean not just the usual whiny crying, but crying with fear in her eyes. Pointing at corners, shouting that shes scared. Thats a surefire approach that sends an entire household freaking out.Whats funny is how easy I could have detected these warning signs. But for some reason, I was oblivious. My love for her made me blind to the brat Im molding her to become. It took an immature adult who openly bullied her in front of me to wake me up.I was actually surprised that I was able to channel the anger into reflection, and then into action. Not that I let my relatives demeanor slip away. I made it clear to him that if he has problems with my child, he can go to me. And that Im not the arrogant type whos deaf to constructive criticism. If anything, its my ability to adapt and understand thats gotten me this far in my life and my career.Since the incident, Ive been more perceptive and hands-on. I changed my schedule and now work at 5 a.m. every day, enough time to start things off before my daughter wakes up. I devote an hour of my morning to her. My evenings are centered on her as well. I gently remind her of the magic words, urging her to communicate how she feels, and applying firmness when its needed. At her age, I find that role playing, deals, and consequences work better than time outs or scolding. Ive changed the routine her yaya and grandparents created while I was away. Screen time has been reduced to one hour a day and any form of violence in games and books are out the window. Were back to less refined sugar and more healthy snacks. I apply the rules of courtesy and non-violence even with how she relates with her toys. Im surprised that in just two weeks, weve reached great improvement. I dont even worry about leaving her with other kids anymore. (Funny though, how the grandparents think Im restraining her spirits, or what they call her true self. Insert rolling eyes emoticon here. Thats another story!)I guess the moral of it all is that parents shouldnt allow all that love to cloud our better judgment. That even in straining situations, theres always something you can get out of it. Sulk, then find a solution. Im all about letting my child grow into her full potential, letting that inner strong-willed characteristic shine. But as the parent, its my job to help her developing brain know where to channel that. Its our job to discipline them in the many ways we positively can in this day and age.Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author in her private capacity and do not in any way represent the views of Preen.ph, or any other entity of the Inquirer Group of Companies.Art by Lara IntongFollow Preen on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and ViberRelated stories:How Should We Control Our Children in Public?A Letter to My Daughter About Looks and PrivilegeHow to Sneak in Veggies and Low-Sugar Treats in Your Kids DietsImproving My Food Choices Was Not Just for Me but for My Daughter",What to Do With Your Spoiled Child?

The PPP Center could be strengthened in terms of its mandate and resources, the OECD said.To raise more funds for infrastructure, the OECD recommended further development of the bond market as an alternative source of financing, as well as introducing non-traditional tools, including levies to capture the appreciation in land value resulting from infrastructure development in order to ramp up revenues.The OECD also recommended more foreign direct investment (FDI) in information and communications technology (ICT), even as the Philippines restrictions on ICT FDIs were more stringent than those in the economy generally.The OECD noted of relatively high internet prices in the country.ADVERTISEMENTAlso, slow internet speeds and challenges in online payment affect e-commerce and the digital economy more generally in the Philippines, the OECD said. /cbb",Faster growth seen for PH but slow internet a challenge
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"The 10th edition of South Asia Economic Summit kicked off in Kathmandu on Tuesday with renewed calls for rapid development of physical infrastructure and removal of non-tariff barriers to expedite regional integration.The region has been talking about regional integration since the establishment of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), a bloc of eight South Asian countries, in 1985. The overarching goal of deeper regional integration is to create a common marketplace where people can live in peace and become prosperous.The issue of regional integration takes the centre stage in most of the South Asian summits like the one that started on Tuesday. Yet the volume of intra-regional tradejust one barometer to gauge the progress made in integrationcurrently stands at 6.9 percent of the total trade in South Asia, up from 5.6 percent in 2006 when South Asian Free Trade Agreement was implemented. The slow growth in intra-regional trade is the result of high transportation cost, lack of proper physical infrastructure, cumbersome regulatory requirement, poor communication linkages and presence of non-tariff barriers, according to experts. No wonder, it is cheaper for Sri Lanka to trade with Brazil today than with Nepal, studies have shown.ADVERTISEMENTClearly, we havent been able to match lofty aspiration of regional integration with concrete measures, said Swarnim Wagle, vice chairman of Nepals National Planning Commission, the apex body that frames the countrys development plans and policies, and the main organiser of the summit being held with the theme, Deepening Economic Integration for Inclusive and Sustainable Development in South Asia. Hence, it is essential to build credible building blocks, Wagle added.Some of these building blocks, according to Wagle, could be reduction in trade cost between South Asian nations; creation of a business friendly environment and revival of manufacturing sector; relaxation in flow of capital across the border in the region; connectivity and consolidation of economic corridors; optimal use ofsurplus power; and creation of a customs union in the long run.These deficiencies indicate South Asia needs to do a lot to catch up with other regional blocs like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Yet there is hope in the region because of robust economic growth over the years. South Asia, home to 1.7 billion people, remained the fastest-growing region in the world since the second quarter of 2014.And its growth reached a record high of 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016. Although the region no longer holds the top position, many are optimistic about the regions prospects as it has just started tapping many of its potentials. We can achieve a lot in the coming days if we do two basic things, Lyonpo Lekey Dorji, Bhutanese minister for economic affairs, told the inaugural session of the summit, which will continue till Thursday. First is cooperation in energy sharing in the region. Second is cooperation in movement of goods and services.Trade facilitationwhich enables goods and services to move across borders smoothlyand energy sector developmentwhich provides South Asian countries access to electricity required to power various industrieshave remained high on the agenda of South Asian countries for long. Efforts to attain these goals are being made through implementation of a programme called South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (Sasec), under which 209 projects worth $121.5 billion are in the process of being rolled out with the support of the Asian Development Bank.Effective implementation of Sasec will go a long way in liberalising the South Asian market, Abdul Latheef Mohamed, Maldivian minister of state for economic development, told the summit co-organised by Ministry of Commerce, Nepal and South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, a think-tank based in Nepal. The summit is being attended by around 200 government officials, policymakers, politicians, development experts, academicians, civil society actors, and people of the business community from across South Asia.The inaugural session of the summit also saw participation of Nepali Finance Minister Gyanendra Bahadur Karki and Nepali Commerce Minister Meen Bahadur Bishwakarma.",South Asia economic summit makes renewed regional integration call

The amount is also bigger than the P700-billion airport project in Bulacan proposed by conglomerate San Miguel Corp., which has already obtained an original proponent status for its project.This proposal is different from the one earlier submitted by the consortium as it does not include the construction of the second terminal building but instead proposes the long-term development of the airport into the countrys second international gateway and also includes the operation and maintenance of the existing and new terminals under a joint venture with BCDA, the Filinvest-JG Summit consortium said.Based on the latest proposal, the consortium will build future capacity augmentation, expand airport facilities including terminals and runways, among others, as well as operate and maintain the existing and new passenger terminals.The consortium also proposes to develop, operate and maintain the commercial assets of the Clark International Airport, which include facilities for general aviation, fixed-base operations and real estate.The creation of a new, world-class passenger terminal in the airport is projected to add passenger capacity of eight million a year from the existing 4.2 million passengers a year, or a total of 12.2 million passengers annually. The ultimate target is 80 million a year upon completion of the fourth phase under the latest master plan.The development of the Clark International Airport is a joint project of the DOTr and BCDA. The airport, as mandated by Executive Order 14 issued this year, was declared to be an alternate global gateway in the country and assist in the decongestion of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.Earlier this year, DOTr and BCDA commenced the bidding for the selection of the engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the Clark International Airport Expansion (Phase 1), wherein 12 local and foreign firms bought the bid documents.The deadline for submission of the bid documents is on Dec. 5 and the notice of award to the winning bidder is to be issued on Dec. 15 this year.ADVERTISEMENTThe consortiums technical partner, CAI, is a leading consultant in the global aviation market. It has provided aviation solutions for more than 50 airports in over 20 countries.Construction and engineering firm Megawide Construction Corp. and partner GMR Infrastructure of India, which jointly operate the Mactan Cebu International Airport, said they have also submitted an unsolicited proposal to the Duterte administration in July last year.","Gotianun, Gokongwei offer to spend P839B to develop Clark"

The convoy carrying the Cambodian leader going to Makati passed through around 8:40 p.m.Among those stuck in Edsa was Phoebe Tolete, who took almost three hours to reach Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City from SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City, a distance she would normally cover in 30 to 45 minutes.On Twitter, the netizen @skylife23 said it took her two hours to reach Balintawak from Monumento, a distance of just 2.5 kilometers.Bong Nebrija, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authoritys (MMDA) operations supervisor, said that due to the difficulty of funneling out cars that were allowed to use the exclusive lanes for a few hours on Saturday, the lanes would be closed to general traffic for the entire duration of the summit.He said there would be no changes in the stop-and-go traffic scheme that would be implemented whenever a VIP convoy needed to pass through Edsa.Nebrija noted that despite the MMDAs relentless public information campaign, many motorists still failed to heed their appeal not to use Edsa especially this weekend when the Asean delegations were scheduled to arrive.Weve been appealing for the past weeks for them to take alternative routes and, as much as possible, avoid Edsa, both directions. Help us decongest (Edsa) by using the Scout Area (in Quezon City) in the west corridor and C5 Road in the east corridor, Nebrija said.Emmanuel Miro, the Asean traffic management commander, suggested that motorists also take advantage of the 17 Mabuhay Lanes, a network of alternative routes for those who wish to avoid Edsa during the Christmas season, when vehicle volume swells by about 20 percent.The number coding scheme will remain in effect on Nov. 13, 14 and 15 despite these dates being declared special nonworking days in Metro Manila, Bulacan and Pampanga.

1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"The use of price multiples to determine the relative value of a stock is not uncommon in the investment community.Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-book value ratio (P/BV) have been the most widely used valuation metrics in the market but the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) have yet to be appreciated.The P/S ratio can be computed by dividing the market capitalization of the stock by the total sales. Alternatively, it can also be computed by dividing the price of the stock with sales per share.ADVERTISEMENTMarket analysts and bankers seem to use the P/S ratio when there is need to justify a stock valuation that the other multiples could not do. For example, when a company is losing or still in the early development stage, the P/S ratio is used to show how much investors are willing to pay for every one peso of sales generated.The P/S multiple measures how much the market expect a company to grow its revenue base in the future, which would later translate to earnings. Some people argue that the use of P/S ratio is more reliable because the sales figures are harder to manipulate compared to earnings, which may be easily influenced by creative accounting policies.Similar to other multiples, a stock with lower P/S ratio compared to industry or market average is considered to be an attractive investment opportunity.A P/S ratio of 1 to 2 times means the stock is fairly valued but a ratio of lower than 1x may indicate the stock is cheap.But how reliable is the P/S ratio as a valuation metric?Remember that P/S ratio is based on the expectation that rising sales will generate profits at some point, lets assume that the P/S ratio is a function of net profit margin.Stocks that trade at high P/S ratio must have high margins while those with low margins deserve to trade at low P/S ratio.Lets validate this by determining the correlation between the P/S ratios of all the listed stocks at the Philippine Stock Exchange and their corresponding historical net profit margins.ADVERTISEMENTThe initial results of the exercise show that the P/S ratios are influenced by net profit margins in 17 percent of the time.It is interesting to note, however, that if the losing companies with negative margins are excluded, the correlation is strengthened to 51 percent.Now, lets assume further that the P/S ratio is also function of earnings growth rate.If profits are growing, higher dividends payout shall also be expected, which increases the value of the stock.Earnings growth do not come without risk. The higher the risk a company takes, the higher the required rate of return on investment the company needs to deliver.By complementing net profit margin as a key determinant of P/S ratio valuation with three more factors namely, earnings growth rate, historical payout ratio and beta into the model, the correlation is enhanced by about 1 percent more.The current P/S average in the market is about 11x while the median P/S ratio is 3x. A stock that trades above market average may not necessarily be expensive because the premium is justified with high profit margins. In the same way, a stock may deserve to trade at discount because it has historically low income margins.P/S ratios are useful in finding value stocks by spotting potential mismatch opportunities.For example, there are stocks with relatively healthy profit margins that are not yet fully priced by the market.Based on 218 stocks that have been subject to this exercise, more than 50 percent has been found to be relatively undervalued by P/S valuation.Some of these stocks include GT Capital, East West Bank, Cebu Air, PNB, Vista Land, GMA7, Union Bank, Manila Water, Emperador and Universal Robina, Wilcon Depot, AEV, BDO, Ayala Land and SM Investments.",How to use the price-to-sales ratio to buy stocks?
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"In the end, it is simple. Europe needs Asia, and Asia needs Europe  not only as trading partners, but as friends and allies in a world where the geopolitical realities are changing fast, and where global threats and challenges endanger Asians and Europeans alike. This is what is on my mind as I prepare for the EU-Asean Summit and the East Asia Summit in Manila.After Britains referendum last year, rumors of the demise of the European Union were greatly exaggerated. Paradoxically, EU public approval ratings have sharply increased since. Brexit shows the benefits of EU membership more clearly than any public relations campaign ever could. The EU27 are conducting exit negotiations in a unified and well-organized manner, in a spirit of fairness toward Britain.Whatever the outcome, the EU economy will continue expanding strongly, as it already is. A raft of ambitious new trade deals are being concluded with key partners, including with Singapore, Vietnam and Japan. In December, EU countries will cross the Rubicon in defense with a major new initiative on capabilities, security research and force projection. And we have brought under control a migration crisis far greater in scale than the Vietnamese boat crisis over 30 years ago. The European Union now looks outward and to the future with a renewed sense of confidence and optimism.ADVERTISEMENTCentral to this is our desire for a strategic partnership with Asia, in particular with Asean, a sister organization committed  like us  to peace and regional integration and with which we are proudly celebrating 40 years of relations. The EU is Aseans second largest trading partner and largest foreign investor. We seek to further open up trade and investment, year by year, eventually agreeing to an ambitious interregional framework that can set trading standards globally.Few emerging economies are growing as fast as those of Asean. Europeans want to do what we can to ensure this impressive achievement is sustained long into the future and helps as many people as possible. That is why the EU is doubling development cooperation funds to support Asean integration and also devotes over 2 billion euros in bilateral cooperation with all Asean countries.EU countries also want to widen and deepen our relationship with Asean, based on mutual respect, common interests and shared values. Unfortunately, the world has become a more dangerous and unpredictable place in recent years. Rapidly evolving international realities require us to take counsel together and cooperate. Our leaders should talk more, and more frankly, and meet more often. A credible rules-based international order is vital for us both, whether we talk about trade, regional security or issues like climate change. Asean and the EU are rightly expanding our security cooperation from preventive diplomacy to conflict mediation and crisis management, from maritime security to transnational crime and counterterrorism. This is sorely needed.Forty years ago, Asian and European leaders took the prescient decision to establish the Asean-EU friendship. At the time, very few people understood that the EU would become the worlds largest market, or Asean its fastest growing group of economies. And almost no one foresaw threats like climate change, todays brand of violent extremism, hybrid war or cybercrime. Yet the maturing Asean-EU relationship can now be used as a tool to help us tackle such challenges together. It can also help us both reap the huge opportunities that are also there in our rapidly changing world.To that end, I am confident we will be celebrating soon the benefits of a working strategic partnership that fulfills the potential of our already rich political, security and economic relations and people-to-people contacts between our societies. I look forward to discussing this ambition in depth in Manila and to marking the significant milestone of four decades of productive and positive relations. Long may it continue.* * *Donald Tusk is president of the European Council, the highest decision-making body of the European Union.","Asia, Europe need to deepen ties in changing world"
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"The onslaught of tropical cyclones, heat waves, droughts and storm surges in Southeast Asia has become more frequent and severe in recent yearsa phenomenon attributed to the significant warming of the planet.The high concentration of population and economic activities along its coastlines makes the region extremely vulnerable to climate change.According to a report released by the Asian Development Bank in 2009, the average temperature in the region increased by 0.1 to 0.3 degree Celsius per decade between 1951 and 2000; sea levels in the region rose 1 to 3 millimeters per year; and rainfall trended downward from 1960 to 2000.ADVERTISEMENTOther multifaceted impact of climate change throughout the region is outlined in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.It is therefore imperative for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to play an active role in global climate change negotiations, a responsibility it has assumed in the past years by releasing joint declarations and statements expressing the groups common understanding, position and aspirations toward a global solution to climate change.Joint statementThe Philippines, as the incumbent chair of Asean, shall carry on this leadership by delivering the Asean Joint Statement on Climate Change (AJSCC) during the high-level segment of the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bonn, Germany.The 2017 AJSCC is expected to reaffirm Aseans commitment to the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.Moreover, it shall serve as a policy guide on how the regional bloc could increase the resilience of its communities and lessen the impact of climate change on the regions economy.While Asean has various strategies, policies and programs in place to address climate change, an apparent linkage for all these remains to be established.Hence, there is a need for the bloc to develop an inclusive and encompassing regional climate action blueprintone that also articulates the need for Asean leaders to put climate action at the center of its national programs and policies in order to sustain the economic gains of the region over the next years.ADVERTISEMENTKey actionsThe envisioned Asean climate action blueprint must outline specific solutions for building the adaptive capacity of its communities. At the outset, here are some key actions that must be taken into consideration for the development of this document:Development of low-carbon and resilient infrastructure assets. Asean must strive to create a financial environment that encourages the development of low-carbon and climate-resilient critical infrastructure projects for power generation, energy efficiency, urban transport systems, solid waste management, etc.In order to do this, Asean should champion the establishment of financial instruments to mobilize private sector involvement and to de-risk investments for greening the regions infrastructure.Promoting the sustainable management of ecosystems. As a strong forestry bloc, Aseans climate action blueprint must also communicate the need to increase the resilience of its natural ecosystems to climate change.Promoting sustainable management of ecosystems will contribute to reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation, and to the enhancement of the regions carbon sink capacity.Emergency responseStrengthening the capacity of the region to respond to disasters. Given the extreme vulnerability of the region to natural disasters, Asean should work on strengthening the capacity of member countries for disaster management and emergency response through existing mechanisms under the Asean Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response.In addition to knowledge sharing and technology transfer among member-states, the strengthening of the operations of the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management must also be ensured.Pursuing climate-smart agriculture approaches to ensure food security. Recognizing the important role of agriculture in ensuring long-term food security in the region, Asean must facilitate the development of adaptation measures in areas where it is of high priority.Strategic plan of actionThe implementation of the Strategic Plan of Action on Food Security in the Asean Region (2015-2020) must be completed, as this provides the groundwork for strengthening the following components of climate-smart agriculture: shortage relief, sustainable food trade, integrated food security information system and agricultural innovation.Throughout the years, the effective and efficient multilateral cooperation among Asean member-states has been evident in the regions impressive economic performance and social progress. This indicates the power of the regional bloc to make a real impact in combating the impact of climate change as long as it stands united.In order to operationalize and implement its own climate action blueprint, Asean should demonstrate political will in integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation in all its regional policies and economic planning frameworks.Likewise, the group must also be relentless in pushing for Annex I countries of the UNFCCC to provide financial support for developing countries to undertake emissions reduction and adaption activities.Check out our Asean 2017 special site for important information and latest news on the 31st Asean Summit to be held in Manila on Nov. 13-15, 2017.

1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"The shift to addressing the Pasig River pollution by cleaning up the tributaries seem to be gaining momentum. Finally! While violent news of wide-scale narcotics cleansing in the county elicits all sorts of emotional and political interest, I want to point out another type of cleansing that will require just as deep introspection and reflection on sanitation and ecological pollution that have plagued us for generations.Conscience of cityThere is no more appropriate barometer to reveal our most intimate state of being, both in the physical and the moral sense, than the state of (or our lack of) sewers. In the words of Victor Hugo, The sewer is the conscience of the city.ADVERTISEMENTIn 2008, I wrote a thesis on how to possibly clean up an estero. Here is the link, should you feel like reading the beast in its entirety: http://rymd.lwr.kth.se/Publikationer/PDF_Files/LWR_EX_08_09.PDFEstero de ValenciaI chose Estero de Valencia, one of the six minor tributaries to the Pasig River. The estero serves a drainage catchment area of 256 hectares. All the grime and gunk in the drains from this area are being channeled untreated into Estero de Valencia.It is not the technology I have designed that is most relevant here, but the approach that I am proposing.The inline treatment system approach I am proposing just means treating the wastewater as it flows along the drains. It is an alternative to two dominant treatment approaches that are difficult to implement in our already built-up cities.These are:On-site treatment (as in treatment systems at the source of pollutant loads) when not every household even has a septic tankOff-site treatment (as in having separate sewer network that brings wastewater load to a central wastewater treatment plant) that requires digging up cities to lay new networks of pipes, and building and operating a massive wastewater treatment plant somewhereThe inline approach is a hybrid, a semicentralized approach which makes use of the already existing network of urban wastewater flows, e.g., road drains and which also involves smaller scale operation at multiple sites near enough to the pollutant sources. These characteristics make the inline system more engaging and educational for urban communities.ADVERTISEMENTWhen I conducted interviews on my study site, I was astonished at how distant the respondents perceived their impact on esteros. We need people to understand urban wastewater flows and become part of the sustainable public infrastructure.Below are the 10 key points for my case of estero cleanup. As much as I have loved the idea of working out the estero problem, the biggest tributaries of pollutant load to the Pasig River are the Laguna de Bay and Manila Bay.Point 1Esteros are not natural tributariesEsteros of Manila are part of the dispersing system of the Pasig-Laguna-Manila Bay region. They have been referred to many times as tributaries to the Pasig River. However, these streams are, in fact, natural distributaries of the Pasig River, with water elevation levels lower than the river itself.Esteros are intertidal, low energy, depositional environments. They are part of low-lying swampy systems that just get flooded.The Pasig River waters and the tide from Manila Bay naturally back flow into the esteros. This is why there are pumping stations maintained in almost every single one of them.Referring to esteros as tributaries to the Pasig River reflects the continued (mis)conception that perhaps cripples our urban imagination. Esteros are being forced to function mainly (and plainly) as drains (Point 2).This is an important point to make because it will define whether:We clean up the estero (we treat the wastewater before they end up in the estero), orWe clean up in the estero (which means the estero will have to receive all the polluted waters and we just use the estero space to remove pollutants before the waters are pumped back to the Pasig River, e.g., dredging the estero, aerating it, etc.).Point 2Esteros have become part of road drainage networkA clear example of how we have morphed esteros into road drainages is Estero de Cegado. (See photo.) You will not find this estero on recent fluvial maps because Estero de Cegado has been converted into a box culvert and has been covered! It is now a road.Many of the esteros suffered a similar fate. They were integrated and have been reduced into road drains, with some of them kept and designated as open drainage channels (if that offers any consolation).I find this to be the biggest tragedy in Manilas ecological history. The esteros were once thriving communities and trading spaces a century or so ago. They were the defining elements of the Manilas landscape: The Venice of the Orient. And the estero banks must have been the prime, desirable lots and properties back in those days, and not the filthy marginal spaces for the poorest of urban communities they have become of late.Esteros as mere drainage channels are now loaded with all sorts of pollutants from the areas and catchments each of them serve. The marginal communities along the estero banks are just the symptoms of the real disease.Thus, clearing up the immediate estero banks will not necessarily solve the entire pollution problem. It will just deodorize the stench but not address the source of the rot.The operative word therefore for any estero cleanup is drainage catchment, which refers to the hectares of built-up areas that contribute storm runoff, untreated wastewater and solid wastes into the esteros.We need to quantify and qualify the drainage catchments pollutant loads to assess how much of these we need to treat, remove and reduce before they end up in the esteros.Point 3Pollutant loads of an esteroAs certain esteros have become part of the road drainage network, there are three general typologies of polluted waters that end up in them:Storm water or rainwater that flows in our road drains. This includes all road litter in drains e.g. dog excreta, odd pair of tsinelas, plastic bags, etc.Wastewater from domestic and commercial use, e.g., kitchen, bath grease, wastewater and (drumroll ) raw sewage.Solid wastes that have been directly thrown into the esteros.These pollutants can be mapped and can be broken down into subcatchment of each manhole. Each of these subnetworks flows into the estero at several manhole points. In other words, Point 4.Point 4Esteros many outfallsThere is not just one location where all the polluted waters from the estero catchment enter the estero. The good news is that, having multiple outfalls means we can intervene at many junctions and have smaller subdivided pieces of the problem to solve.Because each of the outfall serves and drains a unique subcatchment, we could also have a variety of solutions appropriate for each outfall load. Looking closer at outfall loads, we realize that the wastewater pollution source is heavily of domestic origins, i.e., Point 5.Point 5Monstrous sewage loadIn 2008, Estero de Valencia served at least 80 barangays or about 136,000 people (estimated from the 2000 census). However, only a portion of the Maynilad Water Services Business Zone 6 within Estero de Valencia is served by a sewer.The percentage of the total population in Metro Manila that was connected to a kind of sewerage system was only 8 percent at that time. (SEA Presentation, World Bank) I hope that figure has increased since. The raw sewage alone from the 92 percent of the population is an enormous load on waterways, esteros and rivers. That truly puts to shame the wastes from 300 or so households along the estero banks of Estero de Valencia (in 2008).Point 6Reducing solid waste on drainsSolid waste generated per capita in Metro Manila is on average, 0.5 kg per person daily. A portion of that ends up in esteros.Many of existing road drains are overwhelmed with solid wastes that reduce the capacities of drains and pollute the esteros. These wastes are not only from along the banks but also from very far upstream the estero e.g. public markets, school zones, fast food establishment, etc.Point 7Wastewater as a resourceDespite the stink and the instinctive disgust we associate with waste and wastewater, these materials are renewable resources. Multiple retention tanks designed to impound diverted wastewater flows for a duration of time could at the very least, reduce total suspended solids in the wastewater along the drainage networks.The collected solids could then be stabilized in an anaerobic digester and could potentially generate biogas. There are opportunities in drains and manholes! says the inline treatment approach.Point 8Mandamus on Manila BayThe Supreme Court has issued a mandamus to clean up Manila Bay. The bay and esteros are two sides of the same coin. Cleaning up the estero should receive considerable attention in the pursuit to clean up Manila Bay. And a synergy of estero-Pasig-Manila Bay programs within the mandamus, presents a chance to finally rectify the gross misconception mentioned in Point 1.We could then redeem our estuaries and ourselves.Point 9Implement Clean Water ActThe law, with the intent to promote sustainable development provides guidelines to pursue every estero cleanup.Article 1, Section 8: Domestic Sewage Collection, Treatment and Disposal says:Within five (5) years following the effectivity of this Act, the agency vested to provide water supply and sewerage facilities and/or concessionaires in Metro Manila and other highly urbanized cities as defined in Republic Act No. 7160, in coordination with LGUs, shall be required to connect the existing sewage line found in all subdivisions, condominiums, commercial centers, hotels, sports and recreational facilities, hospitals, market places, public buildings, industrial complex and other similar establishments, including households to available sewerage system.It has been more than a decade since the effectivity of the Act. And not all of the establishments are connected to a sewerage systemdefined in the Act to include collection, transport and treatment to a point of disposal of sewage. Apart from relegating responsibilities to private concessionaires, the Act (Article 1 Section 9: National Water Quality Management Fund) also allocated public funds that could go to estero regeneration.Point 10Estero as natural wetlandWetlands themselves have the complex capacities to process pollutants and recycle nutrients. In fact, these capacities have been emulated in ecological wastewater-treatment technologies like constructed wetlands treatment systems. And so going back full circle to Point 1, the esteros as wetlands, are natural ecological sites for wastewater treatment. But for a wetland to actually function, it has to be alive.(The article is based on Trina Go Listancos thesis for a masters in environmental engineering and sustainable infrastructure at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,26583,8,620,3144,20,"IN AN unprecedented and historic fashion, President Duterte made a pointed reference to the American pacification of Mindanao in the 1900s to demonstrate the human rights record of the United States.In turn, his statement has generated much public attentionquite detailed in social media circlesto the US war of aggression and its attendant human rights transgressions, and also to the oft-forgotten Moro resistance to the US intrusion and the role Mindanao played in opposing the US war.Pacification campaignsThe American military attacks on Bud Dajo in 1906 and Bud Bagsak in 1913 in Jolo bring to the fore, in a most graphic manner, how the Americans carried out pacification campaigns in the country.ADVERTISEMENTThe Philippine Commission of 1906 reported to the US Secretary of War the encounter at Bud Dajo. The report says disaffected datus of the island had been joining themselves together in an extinct crater at the top of Mt. Dajo, near the town of Jolo, and had gathered about them the lawless of all the neighboring regions.The joining together quite appeared to be a collective refusal to submit to the American campaign to place all Filipinos under US dominion, a major measure of which was the creation in 1903 of the Moro Province (Act No. 787), with all its attendant instruments of control, including imposition of the cedula tax. The province was placed under Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood as governor, who also served as commanding general of the US Army department of Mindanao and Sulu.Moro resistanceThe US intrusion was promptly met with stiff Moro resistance. From 1903, General Wood had to contend with Moro attacks, mainly in Cotabato and Sulu, directed against the American campaign. The pattern in the conduct of the US campaign was bombardment with heavy artillery and assaults with quick-firing (machine) guns, resulting in the slaughter of Moro communities, such as in Kudarangan, Laksamana and Bud Dajo.The attack on Bud Dajo was part of Woods punishing reprisals for Moro raids on American forces. In Bud Dajo, (d)etachments  of United States troops, assisted by US Marines, constabulary , assaulted the stronghold and exterminated the band. The position was first shelled by a naval gunboat and then assaulted by the combined government forces. Among those in the crater were more or less Moro women and children, who were unavoidably killed.ShellingThe shelling  necessarily killed all who came in the way of missiles and the women fought beside the men and held their children before them. The Moros, men and women, were all fanatics, sworn to die rather than to yield, and certain, as they believed, of a glorious reward in the world to come if they died killing Christians.The language of the report definitely does not elevate the Moros, described as lawless and fanatics. It is noteworthy though that it refers to women and children as unavoidable casualties. Though the report does not say, it indicates that the subject of the assault was a community in retreat.Vic Hurley, an American who stayed in Mindanao for seven years and wrote a book on the Moros in 1936 presented a more detailed account of the encounter, based on acquaintances of elders of many Moro barrios and various histories of the Philippines then extant.Reinforced by 2 batallionsHe writes: A large band of Moros fortified Bud Dajo and defied the authorities to subject them to any law. The American garrison at Jolo was reinforced by the addition of two battalions of infantry and preparations were made for a decisive assault on the Moros.ADVERTISEMENTThe battle began on March 5. Mountain guns were hauled into position and 40 rounds of shrapnel were fired into the crater to warn the Moros to remove their women and children.Kris, spearThree columns of American troops moved up Bud Dajo from different sides and encountered fierce resistance from barricades blocking the approach to the crater. When overwhelmed with heavy bombardment and sniper fire, the Moros sallied forth into the open with kris and spear.On the second day, in the approach taken by a certain Major Bundy, 200 Mohammedans died here before the quick-firing guns and the rifles of the attackers.Fixed bayonetsOn the third day, (a)fter the heavy bombardment had accomplished its purpose, the American troops charged the crater with fixed bayonets. The few Moros left alive made hand grenades from seashells filled with black powder and fought desperately to stem the charge. But the straggling krismen were no match for the tide of bayonets that overwhelmed them and hardly a man survived that last bloody assault.Piled five deepAfter the engagement the crater was a shambles. Moros were piled five deep in the trenches where they had been mowed down by the artillery and rifle fire. The American attack had been supported by two quick-firing guns from the gunboat Pampanga and examination of the dead showed that many of the Moros had as many as 50 wounds. Of the 1,000 Moros who opened the battle two days previously, only six men survived the carnage.Hurleys judgment of the event is significant. He states: By no stretch of the imagination could Bud Dajo be termed a battle. Certainly the engaging of 1,000 Moros armed with krises, spears and a few rifles by a force of 800 Americans armed with every modern weapon was not a matter for publicity. The American troops stormed a high mountain peak crowned by fortifications to kill 1,000 Moros with a loss to themselves of 21 killed and 73 wounded! The casualty reflects the unequal nature of the battle.The Moros had broken the law and some punishment was necessary if America was to maintain her prestige in the East, but opinion is overwhelming in the belief that there was unnecessary bloodshed at Bud Dajo.Hurleys account indicates that the subject of the attack was in fact a sizable community. Women and children stood side by side with the men. The number of people, about 1,000, was too large for a band. The weaponry did not reflect a professional formation under arms.GatlingIt appears those who fought fiercely the invaders were the menfolk defending the community, which reeled from heavy artillery bombardment, quick firing (from machine guns, the Gatling or a later type), and rifle fire (from the Krag or a later Springfield). The band was a community that refused to submit to American colonial governance.The military assault turned out as a massacre of a largely civilian population defending themselves with whatever they could lay their hands onkrises, spears, some rifles and improvised explosives.SlaughterHurleys mention of many fallen bodies riddled with bullets (with as many as 50 wounds) also points to the slaughter. It appears that the defenders were so overwhelmed by heavy firepower that their actions signified willing submission to death as they sallied forth into the open.In 1913, a similar encounter took place in another hilly point in Jolo, The Philippine Commission of that year reports that (i)n Jolo the authorities of the Moro Province, with the invaluable cooperation of the United States Army and the Constabulary, were engaged throughout the year in carrying out the disarmament of the Moro population. Such opposition as was encountered centered in a small portion of the island known as Lati Ward . The population, influenced by the disorderly element, when it appeared that movements of troops were to be made, stampeded to the number of several thousand, including women and children to Bud Bagsak  and flatly declined to surrender individual criminals or arms.Finally, after a long period of negotiations and maneuvering, advantage was taken of a time when all but a defiant minority, including practically all the noncombatants, had left the stronghold and the latter was on the morning of June 11, 1913, carried by a surprise attack of a force of American troops and ScoutsBud Bagsak bombardmentAs in Bud Dajo, the attack commenced with heavy bombardment of the cottas (forts) surrounding the main cotta of Bud Bagsak. One by one, the cottas fell to shelling and infantry assaults.The campaign to capture it took five days. Putting up fierce resistance against the Americans, the Moros would rush out in groups of 10 to 20, charging madly across 300 yards of open country in an effort to come hand to hand with the Americans . In each instance, the charging Moros were accounted for long before they reach the American trenches.Pershings final assaultOn the fifth day, the American forces under Gen. John Pershing made the final assault.Hurley writes: The mountain guns opened up for a two-hour barrage into the Moro fort, and at 9 oclock in the morning the troops moved up the ridge for the attack. The heavy American artillery shelled the Moros out of the outer trenches supporting the cotta of Bagsak and the sharpshooters picked them off as they retreated to the fortress. After an hours hard fighting, the advance reached the top of the hill protected by the fire of the mountain guns, to a point within 70 yards of the cotta.To cover that last 75 yards required seven hours of terrific fighting. The Moros assaulted the American trenches time after time only to be mowed down by the entrenched attackers.About 500 Moros occupied the cottas at the beginning of the battle of Bagsak and with few exceptions they fought to the death.Like Bud Dajo, the encounter at Bud Bagsak eloquently speaks of Moro heroism and martyrdom in the face of a brutal war of conquest. At Bud Bagsak, it is not clear from the account of the Philippine Commission if women and children were included in the 500 or so Moros exterminated by the American assault.Women, childrenWhile it reports of noncombatants being removed from the area, Hurley, however, points to the greatest difficulty in separating the women and children from the men at war.So long as the Moros saw that the American troops were inactive and in barracks many of the women and children would be sent down to work in the fields, but at the first suggestion of an American expedition all of the noncombatants would be recalled to the mountains. As General Pershing had stated, when the Moro makes his last stand, he wishes his women and children with him The military campaigns against the Moros were part of the overall plan of the Americans to assert complete control over the archipelago after the establishment of civil government in 1901. They, however, found formidable day-to-day resistance from the Moros. Before the massacres at Bud Dajo and Bud Bagsak, no American was safe, armed or unarmed, away from the garrisons in Muslim Mindanao. The creation of the Moro Province in 1903 became the basis for campaigns of suppression on the island.Resistance in Luzon, VisayasIn the larger picture, stiff Moro resistance complemented similar organized resistance in Luzon and the Visayas, such as in Samar where Americans engaged in the burning of villages and rice granaries.US President Barack Obama acknowledged two weeks ago in Laos the US shadow war in Indochina. Perhaps it is time for the United States to take another look at this oft-forgotten war at the turn of the 20th century and acknowledge its transgressions on the then newfound sovereign state of Republica Filipina. American anti-imperialists at that time, like Mark Twain, rejected the war and the atrocities it unleashed on the Filipino people.Recounting the stories of Bud Dajo and Bud Bagsak adds to greater public knowledge a significant detail in the Philippine narrative of becoming a sovereign nation, the spirit of which resonates to this day.(Ferdinand C.

This time, the owner of the phone is a mom, and it was her 10-year-old son who was able to unlock it.The video featured the woman first demonstrating that the iPhone X Face ID had been registered to her. She then handed the device to her son. Without so much as a pause, the iPhone readily granted access to the boy.ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Wired, the woman, Sana Sherwani and her husband Attaullah Malik, made the surprising discovery right after they got the new iPhone at their home in Staten Island, United States.Their 10-year-old son Ammar had been excited to see the new gadget and borrowed it from his mother after Face ID was set up.Theres no way youre getting access to this phone, Sherwani told their son as recalled by the older Malik.To their surprise, the device immediately granted access to the boy.It was funny at first, Malik told Wired. But it wasnt really funny afterward.He added, My wife and I text all the time and there might be something we dont want him to see. Now my wife has to delete her texts when theres something she doesnt want Ammar to look at.Wired suggested re-registering Sherwanis face to Face ID. They did so several times. The first try completely locked Ammar out of the iPhone. In their second attempt, they replicated the initial registration indoors with nighttime lighting. This time, Ammar got access again after his third try.This little experiment suggests that certain lighting conditions could give kids access to their parents iPhone Xs, particularly if the kids bear much facial resemblance with their parents.

Quantum allocates more memory and CPU power to the tab a user is currently looking at. This would help display the page or play videos faster and more smoothly. All other tabs get throttled down.ADVERTISEMENTQuantum uses a new CSS engine called Stylo which has been designed to take advantage of modern multi-core systems. Mozilla pegs this as a method for reducing power consumption in portable devices like smartphones and laptops.Mozilla also incorporated a new user interface called Photon. The developers meant for it to have a modernized look while giving the browser scaling flexibility. This means Quantum would be able to adapt to different screens, be it on a smartphone or a desktop PC.Mozilla also mentioned that Photon would be a unifying theme for anything referred to as Firefox. The company may be planning to expand the brand or even restart development for the discontinued Firefox operating system.Because of Quantums Open Source nature, hundreds of programmers contributed to create the new browser.

Vice president of cyber security Ngo Tuan Anh described how they created the mask through 3D printing. They then combined this with some makeup, a prosthetic nose and cutouts of 2D images.ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Bkav, their research team started working on the mask when they received an iPhone X last Nov. 5. This means the mask had been created in less than 10 days; it cost around $150 or about P7,500.Anh first demonstrated the unlocking of the iPhone X without a face in front. Without a face to scan, the device prompted that a passcode be entered. He then tried to unlock the iPhone X again, but this time with the mask in front. The device did so without missing a beat.The cyber security expert then picked up the phone to prove that its Face ID worked properly on his own face, which it did.According to the Apple keynote in September, their research team collaborated with professional mask makers who worked in Hollywood. They did so to train artificial intelligence in telling the difference between a real face and an intricately made mask.However, it now appears that a hacker may not need Hollywood-level crafting skills to fool Face ID. All it could take is a mask with some special processing on the cheeks and around the face, where there are large skin areas, to fool AI of Face ID, Anh said.For the time being, Bkav believes the fingerprint-based systems are still the best biometric solution.

In one such example, Ukraine blocked Russia-based services, including the countrys most widely used social network and search engine, in an effort to crack down on pro-Russian propaganda.When trying to combat online manipulation from abroad, it is important for countries not to overreach, Kelly said.The solution to manipulation and disinformation lies not in censoring websites but in teaching citizens how to detect fake news and commentary. Democracies should ensure that the source of political advertising online is at least as transparent online as it is offline.Freedom House expressed concern over growing restrictions on VPNs  virtual private networks which allow circumvention of censors  which are now in place in 14 countries.It said internet freedom also took a hit in United States over the past year.While the online environment in the United States remained vibrant and diverse, the prevalence of disinformation and hyperpartisan content had a significant impact, the report said.Journalists who challenge Donald Trumps positions have faced egregious online harassment. /cbb","More governments manipulate media with bots, trolls  study"

Targeted at millennials (who make up 60 percent of shoppers on Facebook), the campaign featuring the popular AlDub love team made use of both mobile video and photo ads, which also achieved impressive results in major brand metrics.Mobile is influencing the shopping behavior of Filipino consumers during the busy holiday season where people are discovering brands and products, Bishop said.

The ""no"" vote garnered 38.4 percent.Nearly 80 percent of eligible voters took part in the poll, said the chief of the statistics bureau Davis Kalisch, adding: ""Australians can have confidence these statistics reflect the view of the eligible population.""Same-sex couples could be able to marry by Christmas, but first parliament must adopt legislation giving the non-binding vote result the force of law.Thousands of marriage equality supporters erupted into celebrations at rallies in major cities across Australia when the result was announced.""This means everything, this means everything,"" repeated Chris, fighting back tears and hugging his partner Victor at a huge rally in Sydney.- ""Yes for love"" -Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a moderate conservative who supported legalisation, called the ""yes"" vote an ""overwhelming"" endorsement of marriage equality.""They (Australians) have spoken in their millions and they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality,"" Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.""They voted yes for fairness, yes for commitment, yes for love.""He reaffirmed that his government would now push ahead with passing legislation to change the marriage laws by Christmas.Turnbull defended the ballot's legitimacy, and said he was confident of pushing the issue through parliament in a ""conscience vote"" where lawmakers are not obliged to vote along party lines.But he must first battle hardline elements within his own ruling coalition who have demanded extensive ""religious freedom"" exemptions that would roll back discrimination laws.This include allowing commercial service providers to reject same-sex weddings and let parents pull their children from school programmes they feel undermine heterosexual traditions.Turnbull and the opposition Labor Party have backed a simpler draft bill that legalises gay marriage while allowing religious institutions to refuse to wed same-sex couples if they oppose the practice.That bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate as early as Thursday.A survey of federal politicians by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation published Tuesday found that 72 percent of the lower House of Representatives would support changes to marriage laws and in the Senate, 69 percent would approve the changes.Wednesday's result was a historic accomplishment for proponents of marriage equality after more than a decade of political wrangling and two months of voting, which highlighted deep divisions in Australian society over the issue.""Yes"" campaigners complained gay people and their families were subjected to hate speech, while ""no"" supporters argued they were being accused of being bigots for not favouring such unions.Even before the ballot papers were sent out in September, the debate turned toxic with a poster emblazoned ""stop the fags"" put up in central Melbourne and flyers describing homosexuality as ""a curse of death"" distributed in suburban Sydney.Amid public outcry over the hostile discourse, the government had to rush through legalisation to introduce safeguards during the campaign process, including tighter advertising restrictions.Conservative opponents vowed before Wednesday's result was announced to pursue their campaign for exemptions from the eventual legalisation of gay marriage, which they say will lead to attacks on their freedoms of speech and religion.""If a 'yes' vote is returned, we will do what we can to guard against restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of religion, to defend parents' rights, and to protect Australian kids from being exposed to radical LGBTIQ sex and gender education in the classrooms,"" Lyle Shelton, a spokesman for the Coalition for Marriage, said at the weekend.""We promise our supporters that no matter the result, we will continue to work to defend Australian families,"" he said.

No one was killed there.The gunman left the school after he could not get inside and purposely crashed the stolen truck he was driving into another vehicle and shot at its occupants, Johnston said.The shooter stole the car of a person who stopped to check on the crash and ran away when confronted with a gun. He continued the rampage until police shot him about 45 minutes after it started, Johnston said.""This man was very, very bent on completing what he set out to do,"" the assistant sheriff said.The shootings occurred in the rural community of Rancho Tehama Reserve, a homeowners association of modest houses and trailers in rolling oak woodlands dotted with grazing cattle about 130 miles north of Sacramento.Police offered no immediate word on the assailant's motive, but a sheriff's official said the shooter's neighbors had reported a domestic violence incident a day earlier. Officials did not specify who was involved or what happened.Brian Flint told the Record Searchlight newspaper in the city of Redding that his neighbor, whom he knows only as Kevin, was the gunman and that his roommate was among the victims. He said the shooter stole his truck.""The crazy thing is that the neighbor has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines,"" Flint said. ""We made it aware that this guy is crazy and he's been threatening us.""Johnston said officials received multiple 911 calls about gunfire at an intersection of two dirt roads in the upper reaches of the sparsely populated neighborhood. Minutes later, more calls reporting shots flooded in from different locations, including a small elementary school.""It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets,"" Johnston said.Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and children screaming at the school, which has one class of students from kindergarten through fifth grade.Johnston said the student shot at the school was flown by helicopter to a hospital, and another student was wounded in a car on the way to school.He said authorities believe they know the identity of the shooter but declined to release his name pending further investigation. He appears to have fired a semiautomatic rifle and two handguns at seven locations, authorities said.Salvador Tello said the gunman fired at a truck in front of him as he went to drop off his three children at school. Tello said he was about three blocks from the school when bullets made ""big holes"" in the truck.He said he forced his children to duck down, slammed his vehicle into reverse and headed to the children's grandmother's house.""I put my kids down and put my truck in reverse and went out,"" he said. ""I don't believe it, because I wake up, take my kids, feed them cereal and put them in the truck and say, 'Let's go to school like a normal day.'""On the way, he said he saw an apparent gunshot victim and police at another scene.The rural subdivision is described on its website as a ""quiet private country community"" where ""the people are friendly and the pace is relaxed.""

Roberto Cabarrubias and Consultant on Special Concerns Alvin Dizon, the two officials said Ormoc is in need of generator sets to run the water pumps that were damaged by the magnitude 6.5 earthquake last July 6.It has been three months since the measures were approved, but the beneficiaries reportedly have yet to do their part.Mayor Osmea said Ormoc City Mayor Richard Gomez was supposed to pick up the check a few months ago, but the travel was postponed.Because of this, it was agreed that the Ormoc City Council would pass a resolution for their mayor to enter into and sign a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Osmea, but their legislators allegedly did not work on it.The mayor lamented that several attempts to communicate with Ormoc were made by Dizon, but the latter got no response.I did not cancel it because Im angry.

Why fake news? Based on the death certificate, the girl died of acute gastoentiritis with severe dehydration, while the boy died of meningitis, he said in Cebuano.Limpangogs immediate cause of death was status epilepticus. Meningitis was written in the underlying cause section.In Susons case, her immediate cause of death was electrolyte imbalance secondary to acute gastroenteritis with severe dehydration. The other significant condition that contributed to her death was pediatric community-acquired pneumonia high risk with hypoxia.The two babies both died at 2:20 p.m. at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center last Nov. 11.Berame said that pentavalent vaccine has no history of serious side effects, which include fever and redness around the injected area.I think the parents did not tell the truth probably because we do not give vaccines to children who have a fever or who are not feeling well because the vaccine is expensive at P4,000 per shot, Berame said in Cebuano.Yesterday, Ariel Igoy, Limpangogs grandfather, filed a complaint before the Department of Health (DOH) 7.Ariel wants the DOH to investigate the two deaths so these wont happen to other children in their area.Whatever the result of the investigation, Ariel said, they will not file a case against the persons involved. He just wants to know what happened.I just want the procedure to be corrected because another child might fall victim, Ariel said in Cebuano.Gian Millicent Igoy, 20, Limpangogs mother, said that her son might have received an overdose because he was given one vial of pentavalent.Limpangog, who used the last name of his father, was the second and youngest child of Gian. Gian has a three-year-old daughter.The Igoys wants a certified doctor or medical practitioner to vaccinate children in the future.Lynlyn Suson, mother of Ayesha Mae, also believes that the PCV killed her daughter.Lynlyn said they are willing to file a case against the person responsible.Pajac Barangay Captain Jimmy Ylanan, for his part, said that the person who vaccinated the children is an experienced midwife employed by the City Health Office.Ylanan also said the vaccines were not expired.Mayor Paz Radaza said that she will ask the city attorney to look into the matter.Meanwhile, the DOH 7, in a text message to SunStar Cebu, said that based on the diagnosis provided by the hospital where the two babies died, the symptoms they suffered are not side effects of the vaccines they received.So its still inconclusive to attribute their deaths to the vaccines, said DOH 7 Director Jaime Bernadas.He has ordered the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit to investigate the incidents.Pentavalent vaccine is a combination of five vaccines intended to protect people from five potentially fatal diseases namely haemophilus influenza type B, which causes meningitis, pneumonia and otitis; whooping cough; tetanus; hepatitis B; and diphtheria.",Vaccines blamed for death of 2 infants | SunStar

So we are preparing packages like these, said Queblatin.PAL announced last month that it is opening a thrice-weekly Cebu-Bangkok-Cebu service starting on Dec. 2, 2017. The new direct flight to Cebu will use PALs 199-seater Airbus A321.PR578 (CEB-BKK) will depart from Mactan, Cebu at 9:25 p.m. every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and arrive in Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi Airport at 12:10 a.m. local time. The return flight PR579 (BKK-CEB) will leave Bangkok at 1:30 a.m. local time every Wednesday, Friday, Sunday and touch down in Mactan at 6:15 a.m.CEB-BKK is PALs eighth international flight from Cebu.Department of Tourism (DOT) 7 Director Joshur Judd Llanete II described PALs new direct connection to Bangkok as an early Christmas gift to Cebuanos. He expects this new development to also open opportunities in tourism for neighboring islands in the region like Negros, Bohol and Siquijor.Cebu is not greater nor lesser than Thailand. We are different, said Llanete.Aside from offering adventure tourism, food and heritage products could also entice the Thais and Vietnamese. However, these should be presented in an interactive way, said Queblatin.The Cato official noted that the blossoming travel and tourism market has compelled them to offer new products to the foreign market, especially with the growing numbers of millennial travelers demanding more fun and action-packed tourism activities.We are now going beyond the sight-seeing activity and we are now offering experiential tourism in all of our tourism products, she said.Central Visayas welcomed 3,377 tourists from Thailand in January to April this year, up by 28.65 percent from 2,625 arrivals in the same period last year.Cebu alone recorded 2,813 tourists from Thailand.Rachakorn Saksri, director of Thai Trade Center, during her visit to Cebu last year said that although Thailand and the Philippines have similar tourism products, one differentiating factor for Philippine tourism is its people.Thai tourists come to the Philippines because of its people. You are friendly, she said.The Philippines, she noted, is also popular among Thais because of its scuba diving activities.Early this year, Thailand and the Philippines have also agreed to revive a 23-year-old tourism cooperation agreement.

That was just a minor misunderstanding that can be remedied.The bigger snub that gained less attention than it should have was courtesy of the host country itself. But who did we, with our well-earned reputation for hospitality and friendliness, brush off? On Monday night, when ASEAN leaders met with the United Nations (UN), President Rodrigo Duterte absented himself from the proceedings and, instead, sent Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano.Now, unlike President Duterte, the foreign affairs secretary has spoken to the UN before about the administrations campaign against illegal drugs. As recently as September, Cayetano, in a speech to the UN General Assembly, defended the campaign against illegal drugs as a necessary instrument to preserve and protect the human rights of all Filipinos.There was very little the President could tell the UN that its officials hadnt heard before. Except perhaps this important detail: despite all the questions raised about the so-called war on drugs, public support for it from Filipinos remains high. Just a few days before Cayetanos speech at the UN, in fact, the US-based Pew Research Center reported that when it polled some 1,000 adult Filipinos from Feb. 26 to May 8, 2017, about 78 percent said they approved of President Dutertes handling of illegal drugs. At least 62 percent of the same group believed that government is making progress in the campaign against illegal drugs.Had he attended Mondays meeting, President Duterte would have had the opportunity to defend, before an audience that included UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres himself, his administrations priorities, as well as raise an appeal for ASEANs human rights record to be assessed on the regions own terms.

0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,5806,49,10054,5120,6,"THIS is one of two articles on the issue of a married clergy.The Catholic Church needs to move forward to being less of an institution and more of a Christian community. To do that she needs to re-visit the concept of an elite clergy manning her ramparts and marshaling the faithful within them. The core question to ask is: Did Christ set up a clerical elite?In John 4:23-24 Christ said the time is coming when children of the Father will worship not in temples made of stone but in the temples of their hearts. This after harshly condemning the clerical elite of the Jewish religion as hypocrites that observed the letter more than the spirit of the law of Moses.If Christ calls for worship in the temples of our hearts, where we are our own priests, what does that make of the elite Catholic clergy?The early Christians did not have a celibate male clergy. They chose from among them fellow male or female disciples who led exemplary lives to be their teachers, worship presiders and ministers to their needy or sick in body or soul. These early Christian religious leaders, therefore, had moral authority securely anchored on the communitys high esteem of their imitation of Christs life.Todays elite celibate clergy, on the other hand, get trained, ordained and assigned to minister to a community they do not belong to. With all due respect to admirable exceptions, their losing battle to stay celibate and poor or detached from money, among other failings, often detracts from their moral authority. Essentially ordained to serve churches made of stone what they prioritize is religiosity, religions veneer, and not spirituality, religions core.My thesis, therefore, is that teachers, worship presiders and ministers are best chosen by the Christian community they belong to on the basis of their exemplary lives. They can be married or single, male, female or gay as we are all equal in Gods eyes. These spiritual leaders should hold secular jobs to support themselves and their families and thus avoid putting price tags on sacraments. Integrated with the community in this way, they would have more of the empathy of genuine ministers and less of the aloofness of mere temple worship presiders.Many Christian communities are not able to celebrate the Eucharist in memory of Christ because there is not enough celibate priests to go around. Yet the institutional Church continues to prioritize the preservation of celibacy over Christs call to do this in memory of me when Christian communities can pick from among them exemplary members to be their ministers.In this context, a married but still male Catholic clergy is only one small step towards a less elitist clergy and a more Christian community of equals.","Carvajal: Moving forward, 1 | SunStar"

0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,5806,49,10054,5120,6,"ABOUT a week ago, Pinoy fighter Arthur Villanueva put up a gallant stand against Luis Nery, but fell short and the fight was stopped in the 6th round.Ill give all the props to Pantera Nery as he got up from a knockdown scored by King Arthur in the fourth, gathered himself and mounted a relentless assault that had the ALA pug on the defensive, but what marred the ending was, to me, a premature stoppage.THE FIGHT. In the very first round, furious exchanges were made and Nery got the better of Villanueva especially in the last few seconds of the first.Nery continued being the aggressor in the second, but Villanueva also landed some counters and was boxing on even terms at the end of the round.In the third, Nery started targeting Villanuevas body successfully and the latter started to slow down.In the fourth with about 30 seconds to go, Nery seemed on the verge of knocking down Villanueva with furious combinations while the latter gamely fought back. One of those right hand counters landed smack on Nerys chin and he went on his knee for a flash knockdown.In the fifth, Nery showed that he wasnt hurt at all and was the aggressor all throughout. Villanueva was backing up but countering well.At the 1:30 mark of the sixth round, Nery caught Villanueva with a beautiful combination but the latter covered up while his back was against the ropes. While Villanueva appeared temporarily helpless, he didnt appear hurt at all and was in fact covering up when the referee stepped in to call for the denouement of the fight.PREMATURE. Of course, we all know that the primary job of the referee is to protect the health of the fighters , but every fight is a different fight, and its all about context.For this fight, while Villanueva was fading, he didnt appear hurt or in serious trouble at all and was intelligently defending himself when the fight was stopped.Plus, you should consider that Villanueva scored a knockdown two rounds prior while he was being pummeled by Nery which should account for something when the referee makes his judgement call.At the end of the day, we are glad that Arthur is in good health and he can potentially still bounce back from this loss, but to me he should have been given the benefit of the doubt in that fight.Its on YouTube guys, you be the judge.PROGNOSIS. Nery is the reigning WBC bantamweight champion after he defeated Shinsuke Yamanaka. However, after that fight, Nery was initially found positive for a banned substance but subsequent tests yielded negative results.The fight with Villanueva was a non-title fight. With that win Nery climbs to 25-0, with 19 KOs . Villanueva suffered the third loss of his career, and drops to 31-3, 17 KOs.To me, Nery is still an enigma and the jury is still out on him. There will always be cloud of suspicion hanging over him as a result of that Yamanaka fight. He has a very crowd-friendly style and doesnt mind getting into exchanges. But he appears to be chinny as can be seen in the Villanueva fight and it remains to be seen how he fares against the top-tier fighters in his division.Villanueva on the other hand needs to make some crucial decisions about his career. At 28 he is young enough to regroup and make a title run, but he has lost to some of the best fighters in the bantamweight division (Zolani Tete and Nery) so maybe a move back down to junior bantamweight should be considered.LAST ROUNDS.

They ignore its stench and the dark color of its water as they swim toward the Butuanon Bridge and climb up the slope of a riverbank, to where a pipe produces clear water.Avelino Amores, 73, has seen this before. Its something different children have done for years, something he and his friends also did when he was younger.The only difference is that children used to swim in clear water and drank fresh water from a spring near the Butuanon.Amores, who lives in Zone Monggos in Barangay Paknaan, points to the same spot where the three boys are swimming and the same spring on the rivers bank.Kwaresma mahubsan man ang ubang tinubdan, kana di gyud mahubsan (During Holy Week when heat was extreme, other sources of water in Mandaue dried up, but that spring has never run out of water), says Amores.The spring belongs to Barangay Ibabao-Estancia. Amoress family lives on the boundary of Paknaan and Ibabao-Estancia, the two barangays the Butuanon River divides.Six natural springs have been found along the Butuanon River, located in different barangays.Architect Araceli Barlam, chief of the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (Cenro), has said that these are located in Barangays Alang-alang, Tabok, and Ibabao-Estancia. These springs flow toward the Butuanon River.Full of (other) lifeBarlam says she learned about the springs this year through some residents.Of the six springs, one serves as a source of water for washing clothes and taking baths in Sitio Pulang Bukid, Alang-alang.Authorities have recommended against using the other five because of bad bacteria.We asked MCWD (Metropolitan Cebu Water District) to test (water) samples from the springs, unya puno sya hugaw (but they found out that the five springs were contaminated), says Barlam.Cenro has stated that the 62 establishments along Butuanon River are the main reasons the river is polluted.But long before the establishments were constructed along Butuanon River, Amores recalls, the spring in Ibabao Estancia, particularly the one near Butuanon Bridge, was their source of water for drinking, washing clothes, cooking, and bathing.Makalaba ug makainom mi. Diha naundang lang kay pag-construct sa karsada (We got our water from the spring. We lost the water source when the United Nations Ave. was constructed), he says, referring to the road that now leads to the Marcelo Fernan Bridge.Pero katong tubiga makatabang gyud unta (That source of water could really have helped us), says Amores.Since the spring was their only source of water before, Anita Itang, 57, says they put in a pipe where the water can flow out. Itangs mother served as the springs caretaker.Itang used it until she turned 23, when the road began to be built and the occupants were told to move from the riverbank in Ibabao-Estancia. Itangs family has transferred across the Butuanon River and is now living in Zone Monggos.Soil was dumped over the spring when they were told to leave, she says. Since then, the spring was no longer used.Nindot untag naa pa to kay maminusan ang among gasto sa tubig (It would be great if we still had access to the spring; it would really have helped decrease our water bills), she says.For their part, Cenro personnel are tagging the areas where springs have been found.Barlam says they are doing this so if there is a plan to put a riprap or walls along the Butuanon River, the flow of the springs would not be blocked.Dreams of rescueIbabao-Estancia Barangay Captain Jesus Barz has said there are two springs in his barangay, on the banks of Butuanon River. He plans to talk with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on what they can do to preserve the springs.Kung pananglitan kusog tuboda ato silbing i-develop unya buhatan ug tanke nga magamit nato sa mga tawo kay sayang man. Magamit nato kung kinsay nagkinahanglan ug tubig (If the spring stills produces enough water, we can develop it, put up a water tank and share the water with the people who need it), says Barz.Since there will be developments along Butuanon River, just like building a park on the riverbank, Barz thinks that the springs can be used as source of water for the park.Although the spring in Pulang Bukid can be used for washing and bathing, Cenro is not recommending it for drinking. There are two springs in Pulang Bukid where residents have constructed wells so they can fetch water more easily.The first well, which was constructed in 1992, is still being used by the residents.But Mela Blanza, 55, says the second well, which was constructed around the year 2000, is no longer used after severe flooding about two years ago covered it with mud.After that, Blanza availed herself of a water connection from the Metropolitan Cebu Water District.One more to saveShe says they initially learned there was a spring in the area when they saw clear water running from the soil where a bamboo tree stands. Blanza says the second well, which is located on the slope of the riverbank, was the source of water for some nearby residents for 20 years.They no longer fetch water from the first well because it is already inside the lot of a neighbor, where a house has been constructed.Pero kana siya kung naay mokubkob diha motubod pa gyud na sya (If someone will dig in the area of the deep well, natural water will still flow), she says.As the City Government prepares to host the 4th International River Summit next year, there are now two bodies of water that have to be saved in Mandaue. For parched or poor residents, the six springs represent their hope of a better life.After 20 years, what has the Butuanon River Watershed Management Board achieved?

The kind of mosquito which transmits the disease is called Aedes poecilius that carries the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or Brugia timori.The Center for Disease and Control (CDC) informs that Brugia malayi and Brugia timori are most common in Aisa.[Lymphatic] Filariasis, is a chronic parasitic infection caused by parasites that live inside the lymphatics.As a chronic condition, its development takes time to incubate. As a matter of fact, literatures support that the life span of the adult parasites is between 10 to 40 years.Moreover, the thread-like parasitic filarial worms lodge in the nodes and vessels of the lymphatic system.Furthermore, In the Philippines, over 25 million people live in endemic areas for this disease, adds Public Health literatures.According to epidemiologic statistics, Aedes poecilius is a home to 45 provinces in the country with the highest prevalence of Filariasis in Regions V, VIII, XI and CARAGA.On the other hand, the same statistical data claim that Cebu has the lowest rate ever recorded in history.Some literatures call this parasitic disease as Elephantiasis due to the abnormal enlargement and disfigurement it causes on the affected body part.As the term lymphatic applies, the lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system that carry clear fluids called lymph towards the heart.Health experts explain that the lymphatic system plays an important part of the immune system on top of its primary function of maintaining fluid balance to the circulatory system.Meanwhile, CDC explains that as this infection spreads from person to person by mosquito bites, the adult worm lives in the human lymph vessels, mates, and produces millions of microscopic worms, also known as microfilariae.And then, these Microfilariae circulate in the person's blood and infect the mosquito. In the event that this infected mosquito bites another person, the latter becomes infected.Furthermore, these Microfilariae grow and develop in the mosquito.When the mosquito bites another person, the larval worms pass from the mosquito into the human skin, and travel to the lymph vessels, it points out.CDC maintains that these parasites grow into adult worms and that the entire process takes six months or more.An adult worm lives for about five to seven years and that the adult worms mate and release millions of microfilariae into the blood.Ultimately, People with microfilariae in their blood can serve as a source of infection to others, it emphasizes.On the other hand, the Public Health Nursing in the Philippines shares that the following are some of the manifestations of lymphatic filariasis: hydrocele ( swelling of scrotum); lymphedema (temporary swelling of upper and lower extremities); and elephantiasis (enlargement and thickening of the skin of the lower and upper extremities, scrotum and breast).It informs that laboratory exams that confirm such diagnosis by the doctor include Nocturnal blood exam (blood are taken from the patient after 8 p.m.) and Immunochromatographic test (a rapid antigen test done at daytime).The World Health Organization (WHO) shares that treatment for Filariasis may include anti-filarial drugs (Diethylcarbamazine Citrate or DEC) and surgery when necessary. Unfortunately, fever has been reported as the most common side effect of this medication.As part of the 2004 Executive Order No. 369, the National Filariasis Control Programs goal was shifted from control to elimination of Filariasis devoting the month of November for mass treatment of Filariasis among affected communities.As a mass-based program, the susceptible population is given DEC as the dosage of 6 mg per kg of body weight taken as a single dose.For WHO, lymphatic Filariasis afflicts over 25 Million men with genital disease.The Public Health Nursing suggests the following preventive measures in protecting individuals and families in endemic areas: use of mosquito nets; use of long sleeves, pant and socks; application of insect repellents; screening of houses; and health education.(Email the columnist: polo.journalist@gmail.com)",Filariasis awareness health month 2017 | SunStar

They were then released on the afternoon of the same day.Chavez, one of the respondents, forcefully ordered crew member Ramonito Villalon to operate F/V Aqua King and follow the navy vessel.Despite insisting that he is not licensed and authorized to operate, Villalon, frightened, steered the vessel, the Ombudsman said.It said that other respondents Villa, Juaneza, De la Cruz, Mendones, Gepanago and two others boarded the vessel and conducted indiscriminate search.A day after, on August 20, one complainant discovered that the money worth P50,000 kept in the cabin for the vessels emergency expenses was missing.According to complainants, respondents committed qualified piracy for boarding F/V Aqua King without authority; grave coercion for forcing Villalon to navigate the vessel; arbitrary detention for preventing crew members from leaving the vessel; and robbery for taking the money.The respondents, for their part, denied the charges and claimed that they were in the lawful and regular performance of their duties as members of the Task Force Lawod when they apprehended complainants for violation of Republic Act 8550, or the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998.The task force has the primary function of implementing and enforcing coastal laws, rules, regulations and ordinances within the component cities and municipalities of Negros Occidental, the resolution said.The Ombudsman resolved that there is no basis for filing the qualified piracy, grace coercion, arbitrary detention, and robbery charges.However, there is substantial evidence to hold respondents liable of simple misconduct.

Isabel Palomar, and directress Sr. Ellen Joy Cajegas, to encourage students understand more about sainthood and the life of the saints.With this, they are inspired to only do good, which is the meaning of true freedom, said Pavaricio.Halloween, also known as All Hallows Eve, is celebrated in many countries including the Philippines on the eve of All Saints Day on November 1 and followed by All Souls Day on November 2.Msgr. Julius Perpetuo Heruela, a liturgist of the Diocese of Dumaguete and parish priest of the St. Augustine of Hippo Parish in Bacong, Negros Oriental, said the liturgical celebrations highlight the importance of saints in the Christian world and the remembrance of the faithful departed.He said saints and martyrs provide inspiration to people to lead holy lives and it is just but fitting to honor them on this particular feast day.All Saints Day is for the triumphant church, for those who have already arrived in heaven, something that all of us should desire, Heruela said.On the other hand, the observance of All Souls Day encourages people to offer prayers for the dead, who are suffering in Purgatory, that they would receive reparation for their sins, he said.By offering prayers for the souls who are still in Purgatory (penitent church), they are eased of their suffering and temporal punishment as they go through a process of purging so they can enter heaven, he added.And so people offer masses and prayers, light candles and visit the tombs and graves of their departed loved ones as a sacrifice for the souls, which also brings indulgences for the souls, the priest said on Monday.He said that a cemetery is a sacred place where the deceased are awaiting resurrection.Candles symbolize the light of Christ, which gives hope for all those who desire to go to heaven, Heruela said.Heruela appealed to the Catholic lay faithful not to depict Halloween as a celebration for the supernatural, such as vampires, ghosts, and the like.People need to be educated about the true meaning of the celebration of Halloween, rather than sticking to tradition and the customary practice of serving the favorite foods and drinks of the departed, he said.These may have been handed down from our pagan forefathers but the true celebration of the Catholics and Christians is to focus on a prayerful observance of the twin feasts of the Church, Heruela said.

They have the right to freedom of assembly and we have to respect that, he said.According to Portento, while plans were not yet final on the Islamic gathering in Dauin, the PNP had already mapped out a security contingency plan, in coordination with other security forces, such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to include the Army and Navy, the Coast Guard, the intelligence community and the provincial Joint Task Force Leon Kilat.To ensure everyones safety, the profiles of the participants had been forwarded to higher headquarters for verification, he said.Also, strict measures are in place, such as the confinement of the participants to the venue for the duration of the prayer meeting, the issuance of identification cards for the activity, detailed pick-up and drop-off of participants from their port of entry, such as the airport, seaport and bus terminals to the venue and back, and the assurance from organizers that not one of them would be billeted at a hotel, he added.After all, this is a prayer meeting and therefore they are expected to be at the activity venue rather than at hotels, Portento said.He warned that those found staying at hotels and resorts will be subjected to questioning by the police.The Department of Tourism (DOT) has also been informed about the Muslim prayer gathering, while hotels and resorts have been asked to report the presence of suspicious persons during the scheduled johore.Some participants have arrived in Dumaguete as early as October 25, Portento said.The activity, he noted, is open to those who would like to attend and experience the Muslim prayer meeting.In fact, space will be provided for those from other religions who are welcome to attend the johore.Major General Jon Aying, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army, has been invited to speak as a guest lecturer on anti-radicalism. Portento said he is also attending.As to the presence of foreign guest lecturers in the prayer meeting/seminar, Portento said the organizers have not submitted any names yet although they earlier mentioned that possibility.The only thing that worries the PNP is if the weather turns bad, just like last week when heavy rains triggered massive flooding in Dumaguete and elsewhere, because they will have to pull out their personnel to respond to distress calls, Portento added.

But only two really do, she said.The reasons why Filipinos do not wash their hands were due to lack of access to clean water, hand washing facility and soap. It is for this reason that we develop this project, she added.Following the completion of hand washing facilities in recipient schools, Safeguard will provide them with 17,000 pieces of soaps.Schools in Gida prioritizedP&G has long been a partner of Synergeia in its education reform program. Their first collaboration led to the provision of laptops in select schools in the country, recalled Synergeia program officer Edwin Nacionales.I think P&G has been satisfied how Synergeia has been doing its initiatives in schools. So they have this second phase which is the construction of hand washing facilities in 55 public elementary schools in 19 towns in Iloilo, he said.Of the 19, Lambunao has most number of hand washing facilities considering that the schools therein were located in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (Gida).The schools were Felimon Libero Memorial Elementary School (ES), Walang ES, Malag-it, and Maribong ES in Lambunao West District and Supoc Corot-on ES and Simsiman ES in Lambunao East District.In Alimodian, the recipients were Quinaspan ES, Bancal ES, Manguining ES and Kulini ES.Nacionales was with Synergeia operations officer Annie De Leon during the turnover ceremony.Preventing absences due to illnessBy improving the personal hygiene of pupils and increasing their awareness on the importance of hand washing before eating, and after using the toilet and playing, Bancal Elementary School principal Mary Jert Masculino hoped to lessen the incidence of absences due to illness in their school.We are very thankful to P&G and Synergeia because we used to have a hand washing area in school but it was damaged. With this, we can eliminate absences due to illness, she said, adding they will soon construct another five-faucet hand washing facility so that 10 pupils can use it simultaneously.Principal Arcelita Lebuna of Walang Elementary School, for her part, assured that the community will help maintain the project and that proper and frequent hand washing will not only be practiced in school but also in their homes.According to Provincial Administrator Raul Banias, only 68 out of 100 pupils in Grade 1 can graduate while the 32 drop out of school due to poverty and sickness.If this continues, opportunities for these people are scarce in the future.

Before Yolanda struck, he just walked a few steps from our house to the shoreline, Emnas shared.Tacloban City Mayor Cristina Romualdez said the local government has been conducting livelihood training courses in partnership with national government agencies to help jobless and low-income families.The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) confirmed on Monday that as of the first half of 2017, several projects under the livelihood cluster had not yet begun in Eastern Visayas.In terms of transportation, the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas has provided six buses for the use of relocated families. The free ride for workers and students has been around for more than a year, but thousands have to take public transportation due to limited bus seats.For Evangeline Sanchez, 40, another main concern is water supply.Their family of six, she said, only gets an allocation of five jugs or about 10 liters daily for shower, toilet, laundry, and cooking. Their family buys drinking water at P30 per jug.The family gets water from delivery trucks of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the city government, the Leyte Metropolitan Water District, and some private contractors.Five jugs daily are not enough for all of us. In days without water rations, we are forced to buy water from private water delivery services, Sanchez added.Neda-Eastern Visayas Director Bonifacio Uy said that under the medium-term water supply project for Taclobans northern resettlement areas, water trucks would be awarded to Tacloban before the year ends. Bidding for the civil works component of the project was held last July 20.Plans and approved budget contract for the long-term water supply project is still being finalized for presentation in the procurement conference.The schedule of the conference is still subject to the completion of all necessary documents, Uy added.Both projects are being implemented by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), a state-run corporation based in Quezon City. LWUA has no office in the provinces.The government targets to move 14,000 families to the resettlement sites by next year, according to Romualdez.As of end October, more than 9,000 families have already been transferred from danger zones to their new homes.

It is a personal and official insult. That is why you hear my curses, nagmumura ako [I curse] because it angers me when you are a foreigner, you dont know exactly what is happening to the country, Duterte said in a press briefing, as the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit drew to a close Tuesday.Duterte to foreign human rights critics: Lay off https://t.co/sDo55hwVGt pic.twitter.com/3FlKnliRgM  CNN Philippines (@cnnphilippines) November 14, 2017The President was responding to a question on how he responded to concerns of world leaders about the state of human rights in the country. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier said human rights, extrajudicial killings, and the rule of law were brought up during his meeting with Duterte.His reaction differs from how Trudeau described their exchange. The President was receptive to my comments. It was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,"" Trudeau said during his press briefing.Related: Canadian PM Trudeau brought up human rights issues with DuterteOver the past year, some heads of state including Trudeau, former United States President Barack Obama, and international organizations such as the United Nations criticized or raised concerns over alleged extrajudicial killings and abuses from the police under Duterte's controversial anti-drug campaign. These have been met with tirades from Duterte, who claims they do not understand the country's dire situation with illegal drugs.Trudeau was likely ""playing to the Canadian audience"" in his remarks, political analyst and University of Sto. Tomas political science department chairman Dennis Coronacion told CNN Philippines' The Source on Wednesday.Another analyst, University of the Philippines' College of Law associate professor Jay Batongbacal, said that ""the truth is somewhere in between"" Duterte and Trudeau's conflicting statements.""With respect to Justin Trudeau, Canadians from my experience have always been very polite. That might also be his polite way of describing the actual exchange,"" Batongbacal said on The Source. The professor was once a scholar of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, named after the 15th Prime Minister of Canada and the current prime minister's father.However, the experts downplayed the impact of the verbal diasgreement between the two leaders, saying it would not affect relations between the two countries.Batongbacal said ""the stakes are not that high in terms of economic and political relations"" between the Philippines and Canada.""If it's an isolated statement... I don't think it's going to have a huge impact on the relations of the two countries,"" Coronacion added.Duterte again said they should not pin the blame on all the policemen because its unfair.Maybe I would say there are some killings extrajudicially, but I order their arrest and detention like what happened in Caloocan. You will be hearing more. Keep track of that record. Because in the end, you will know, he said.The case of 14-year-old Kian delos Santos, who was killed in Caloocan police operations, brought light to alleged police abuse after closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage showed the boy being dragged away by two civilians believed to be policemen.But the President said not to use just any drug war data.Do not get your documents from the opposition and from the communists. They are all falsified, he claimed.Human rights groups believe the figures of drug-related killings since Duterte took office go as high as 13,000. But government data as of October 2017 claims there are only 3,967 deaths, adding that there are over 100,000 who surrendered.Duterte has since transferred anti-illegal drug operations to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.CNN Philippines digital producer Eimor Santos and multi-platform writer Regine Cabato contributed to this report.",Duterte 'insulted' with how world leaders raised human rights

Once, maybe, during my term. But as of now, we are not ready to fight,"" Duterte said.The President was speaking to the press after the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit closing ceremony.The statement comes after Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China announced on Monday the beginning of negotiations for a code of conduct in South China Sea. It also comes ahead of the release of the Chairman's statement, a document where President Duterte, as chairman of the ASEAN 2017, was expected to comment on the maritime row.Duterte has said the country  or any nation  cannot afford go to war with the threat of a nuclear attack from North Korea.""We cannot fight, start a war  and with the North Korea crisis looming ahead... Nobody has that luxury,"" he said.North Korea has fired 22 missiles since February, as it brandishes a rapidly-progressing nuclear program that has alarmed world leaders. The President has expressed concern a ""nuclear holocaust"" would turn the Philippines, a relative non-player in the issue, into an arid region.However, maritime expert and UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea Director Jay Batongbacal, says raising the ruling need not mean invoking war with China.""War is not the only option. There were a range of other possible things he could have done, especially with respect to the arbitral ruling,"" said Batongbacal.""He could have also exacted more concessions than what he has gotten so far... We still do not have any written assurances, for example,"" he added.Under Duterte's administration, relations between the Philippines and China have warmed.After China refused to acknowledge the 2016 arbitral tribunal decision which favored the Philippines' claim over the islands, the President has put the ruling in the back burner. His softer stance towards the dispute has drawn flak from critics seeking more vocal government objection towards Chinese presence in contested waters.Batongbacal called the diplomatic approach with China ""theatrics,"" adding that the eastern giant continues to build on the disputed islands and patrol the area.""This is all to present an atmosphere of stability, cordiality, and friendliness about the issue. Actually, not much has changed on the ground,"" he said.On the other hand, University of Sto. Tomas Political Science Chair Dennis Coronacion believes the talks should not be easily dismissed.""We have to take note of the fact that if we backtrack a bit, China wouldn't want to talk to any of the parties at the multilateral setting. I consider this as a major achievement even though these are just preliminaries,"" said Coronacion.""We are hoping that once this has gained momentum, the situation on the ground will become better,"" he added.Duterte also explained talking to China would solve only one aspect of the maritime row.He said the arbitral tribunal ruling, which invalidates Chinas nine-dash line boundary claiming roughly 85 percent of the South China Sea, only applies to China and the Philippines, and not to territories claimed by countries in the south.Six countries have overlapping claims in areas of the South China Sea. Four of these countries  Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam  are members of the ASEAN.""Hindi natin matapos kung sabihin mo puntahan mo 'yung China, give them a copy of the arbitral ruling. It does not end there,"" Duterte said.He said it would be better for all claimants to agree on a code that can govern behavior in disputed parts of the sea amid the maritime row.Like the Philippines, China does not want lives lost over the dispute and has promised to expedite the adoption of a Code of Conduct, he said.""I said, 'Let it be. We'll just observe certain norms of conduct and we were pressing China to set a date.' And China said, 'Do not just hurry up. But we will consider really fast tracking this Code of Conduct,'"" said Duterte, quoting a Chinese official he said he'd spoken to.China and ASEAN countries on Monday agreed to begin negotiations for the Code of Conduct. The code will set the rules of behavior in the contested waters even as the overlapping sovereignty issues remain unresolved.",Duterte will raise arbitral ruling 'maybe once' in his term

And now it is up to us here in the Parliament of Australia to get on with it,"" he told reporters in Canberra.Opposition Labor Party leader Bill Shorten told the Melbourne rally the postal vote itself should never have happened.""I feel for young people who had their relationships questioned in a way I wouldn't have thought we would see ever again, but nevertheless what this marriage equality survey shows is that unconditional love always has the last word,"" he said.Politicians are expected to begin discussing the specifics of the same-sex marriage bill as early as this week.However, even ahead of the release of the results, conservative politicians inside the Australian parliament were preparing for a fight over how marriage equality would be legalized.Prominent supporters of same-sex marriage celebrated the decision. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce danced on stage in Sydney with author and actor Magda Szubanski, and urged Turnbull to ""get on with it.""Australian Olympic champion Ian Thorpe warned conservative politicians against delaying the legislation.""(The result) spells it out loud and clear ... If they play around with this issue any longer, it will be at their peril,"" he told reporters Wednesday morning.Australians long in favor of marriage equalityAustralians have long been in favor of marriage equality, but multiple governments have maintained they wanted to keep the traditional definition in law.In 2015, under pressure from moderates in his Liberal party to take action, then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced there would be a national vote, or plebiscite, to decide whether marriage equality should be legislated.He was unable to get funding to hold the plebiscite after legislation was blocked twice in the Australian senate. Abbott's successor, Turnbull, announced in August a national postal vote would be held.It was one way to get around the funding issue, as the survey was run by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, removing the need for parliamentary approval.Voting opened on September 12 and Australians who had registered to vote had until November 7 to return their surveys.This story was first published on CNN.com, ""Australia votes 'yes' to same-sex marriage.""",Australia votes 'yes' to same-sex marriage

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1790,334,38896,3676,15,"Manila (CNN Philippines Life)  The special gala dinner of the 50th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) put a spotlight on Filipino creativity and artistry.Normally, when you do APEC or the ASEAN, its always a feature of technology, or intense architecture, says production designer Gino Gonzales, who was responsible for the look of the centerstage. But this one, with the resources that we have, we thought we should put talent [at] the center of everything. So its all about our music, our dances, and just the performers. Its just a focus on human capital and talent [since thats what the Philippines is known for].The gala dinner, held at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay, had at least 1,500 guests with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte welcoming ASEAN heads of state, as well as dialogue partners from the United States (represented by President Donald Trump) and Canada (represented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau).Upon entrance, the guests encountered a hall with a grand gazebo conceptualized by award-winning designer Ito Kish.The welcoming area is divided into three parts, representing the past, the present, and the future of ASEAN nations. For the past, Kish designed a facade of a bahay na bato, made of tarpaulin mesh and metal connectors. The first thing that crossed my mind was really hospitality, says Kish. [I thought of it] because it looks grand, it looks celebratory, and [it] represents who we are, from the Spanish era.The bahay na bato was also an answer to a challenge of putting something impressive in a wide area with a 40-meter clearance.You cant come up with miniscule props or else it will just disappear, says Kish. I was always thinking of how to make it big. We have 20 Talisay trees that all came from Laguna and Batangas [brought in here at the venue], which we all started sourcing three months ago. I wanted to make sure theyre all 18 to 20 feet high so theyll fill up the space.The welcoming area of the gala dinner is divided into three parts: the bahay na bato facade where President Duterte welcomed the world leaders, the Talisay tree garden where cocktails were served, and the photocall wall decked with 119 parols. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHThe photocall backdrop is a 31-meter wall with 119 parols made of metal rods, which was meant to represent the future of the ASEAN. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHThe venue is essentially a black box and is lit by the clusters of basket lamps and the light coming from the facade of the bahay na bato. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHPresident Duterte welcomed the leaders under the bahay na bato, and led them to the garden of Talisay trees. From the garden, guests were also immediately greeted with the photocall backdrop: a 31-meter wall with 119 parols made of metal rods, which was meant to represent the future of the ASEAN.It really looks like a traditional garden party but the stars really ginawa namin nasa wall instead of nasa sky, says Kish. We really added a story to the whole thing. Thats what Im known for, creating a story.The whole area was lit by the parols, the dream-like silhouette of the bahay na bato, and a cluster of Bicol-made baskets, representing how the ASEAN region is woven together.In conjunction with Kishs design for the welcoming area, the dining and performance halls centerpiece had a hanging piece designed by Wataru Sakuma and MASA Ecological Development Inc., which is based in Tagaytay.There was a directive from [the show director] Monino Duque to put something that is sculptural, something that doesnt have walls, says production designer Gonzales. He wanted a circular stage with almost a 360-degree view with something that was hovering. We asked Wataru to do paper discs in silver and gold. Its really the idea of almost like an aurora borealis, the idea of having everyone under one sky. Its a very simple thought.The design of the whole area was intended to be reminiscent of Christmas decors, welcoming guests to the countrys festive tradition of a long Christmas (some of the designs will also be sent to Malacaang after the event as the palace's Christmas decor). Outside the venue are five traditional giant parols from Pampanga hanging on tall cranes (five to represent 50 years of ASEAN). Poinsettias were also installed along the red carpet.This centerpiece at the ASEAN Gala dinner by Wataru Sakuma is made up of 5000 pieces of gold and silver textured paper. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHLamp baskets made in Bicol represent how the ASEAN region is woven together. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHGuests were served a four course meal of Filipino dishes by Chef Jessie Sincioco of the Sofitel group. Photo courtesy of ITO KISHFor the show proper, Duque faced the challenge of making a short program with a time limit. [I was told] that President Duterte only wants his entertainment fast, easy and sweet, says Duque. The program proper titled Bravo ASEAN! ran for 30 minutes and was divided into three symphonies featuring performers from across the Philippines.The first section was a new take on Hotdogs iconic song Manila, which served as a musical welcome to ASEAN guests and delegates and was played by a mix of an orchestra, a brass band, a rock band, and string and vocal soloists.The second number, called Partners, featured different dance forms, such as ballet, contemporary dance, hip-hop and tap dance. The performers featured were Sining Kumintang from Batangas, Davao Tappers, and Belinda Agora Dancers.For the third number, called Jubilare, exulting and celebratory songs were chosen and were performed by some of the countrys best talents: Lani Misalucha, David Ezra, Darren Espanto, Elha Nympha, Sam Shoaf, Jona, and Jed Madela.Everything was bound by simplicity, from the design of the venue to the production. Like Kish and Gonzales, Duque wanted the talent to take centerstage.I want to impress [the world leaders] with the wealth of talent and artistry of the Filipino, says Duque. As a matter of fact, in the curtain call, when they take their bows, I dont want them to take individual bows. You all bow as artists, youre taking a bow for the country, youre not Lani Misalucha the singer, youre Lani Misalucha the Filipina. We all bow together. Thats what I want the leaders to see.",LOOK: Behind the scenes at the 2017 ASEAN gala dinner

The official said that from November 4 to 9, Trump will have one-on-one meetings with the leaders of Japan, South Korea, and China.He will then proceed to Vietnam on November 10 for the leaders' meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On November 12, Trump will be in the Philippines to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).""On November 13, the President will celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and also participate in bilateral meetings with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and other leaders,"" the officials added.The two leaders have been likened to each other for their tough talk and controversial statements. Duterte and Trump have exchanged two phone calls in December 2016 and April 2017. This is in stark contrast to Duterte's stinging remarks against former US President Barack Obama, US lawmakers, and the former US ambassador to the Philippines over their comments on alleged human rights violations in the country's drug war.After he assumed the presidency in July 2016, Duterte made moves indicating a shift in foreign policy towards China and Russia, and away from the country's longstanding ally, the United States.The senior administration official, however, said at at the briefing that the Philippines-US alliance ""is still very robust"" especially in areas of counterterrorism, people-to-people ties, and human rights.""The amount of cooperation that's taking place below the leader level and made possible by our longstanding relationship and alliance with the Philippines is still very robust,"" he noted.He clarified that Trump would be present at the opening of the East Asia Summit, and that the US would be ""well-represented"" at the meeting on November 14.""Again, this is the longest trip of his presidency, the longest trip in more than a quarter of a century to Asia.

But he said it was illogical, considering the actions he had done to confiscate the shipment.He said if he really wanted to ""smuggle, enrich himself and also get away scot-free,"" he could have easily told Chinese authorities the intelligence information was negative to protect the smugglers.On the evening of May 25, a Customs official from Xiamen, China alerted their local counterparts about the shipment of an undetermined quantity of illegal drugs from China.At dawn on May 26, BOC officials raided two Valenzuela warehouses where they found 604 bags of shabu hidden in five solid steel cylinders used in printing presses, each a foot in diameter.Faeldon said this happened because he sent letters of authority, showing his ""swift and decisive"" action to seize the contraband.Filed by a 'mere usurper'Faeldon also questioned the identity of the one who filed it - Norman Balquiedra, who signed as head of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)'s Seaport Interdiction Unit.""Is he even an actual person?""

The formation of two agencies was also among the key recommendations of the report.These would be the Bureau of Customs Service to assess and collect duties and taxes from shipments under the guidance of the Department of Finance.The other agency would be the Bureau of Security Control to protect and secure Philippine borders, and will fall under the Department of Interior and Local Government.The failure of government to act on recommendations to revamp the bureau will negatively impact the administration's war against drugs, crime, and corruption, it said.""The current issue in the Bureau is part of the overall campaign on reducing criminality in the country. The inability of government to curb corruption will in turn facilitate the entry of illegal drugs into the country will surely result in increased criminality in the country,"" the House Ways and Means Committee report said.Dismiss, probe BOC officialsThe ways and means committee also said that Customs officials behind the shabu shipment must be immediately dismissed from public office for ""serious errors, gross inexcusable negligence, and willful dereliction of duty,"" on top of graft and corruption and must be prosecuted.This includes former Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon who already resigned from his post and was replaced by Isidro Lapea, former head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).Faeldon was slammed for centralizing the power to issue alert orders on shipments through the creation of a Command Center.""By doing so, Players in the industry need not transact with many Bureau Offices. Instead, they only needed to transact and pay ""tara"" to the ComCen,"" the ways and means committee said.Related: BOC chief abolishes Command CenterFaeldon must also be probed for graft and corruption, for doing business with fixers, and for causing delay in the prosecution of drug cases.Senator Panfilo Lacson has said Faeldon received an initial payoff of P100 million when he assumed as head of the BOC in 2016.Faeldon is detained at the office of the Senate sergeant-at-arms for refusing to attend Senate hearings into the shabu shipment.The committee also recommends authorities to investigate Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service director Neil Estrella, who led the Customs team that raided the Valenzuela City warehouses where the drugs were discovered. Estrella and his entire raiding team must be probed for lapses in the raid, including the failure to coordinate with PDEA, the lead agency on the fight against drugs.Deputy Commissioner Gerardo Gambala, meanwhile, failed to issue alert orders for the drug shipments which Estrella said were declared as kitchenware by its importer, EMT Trading, the committee said.""The reason why the P6.4 billion worth of Shabu was able to pass through the Bureau's Green Lane is attributable to the incompetence and corruption of not one but many Bureau personnel,"" the committee said. It recommended the immediate dismissal and investigation of 13 BOC personnel and consultants.LOOK: How 6.4B-worth of shabu was shipped from China to PHEarlier, the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs also highlighted the need to pass a legislation to replace the BOC by a new revenue collection agency. It released its own report in August 2016 after conducting several legislative hearings.The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee is still conducting its own investigation into the 604-kilogram shabu shipment that was seized from two different warehouses in Paso de Blas and Barangay Ugong in Valenzuela City on May 26. It has yet to release its findings.Fixer Mark Taguba named Customs officials and individuals with aliases he has allegedly been paying off to ease the release of his shipments. He said he pays up to P27, 000 per container as ""tara"" or grease money for Customs officials. He, however, denied the shabu came from his containers.Read: Fixer's texts link customs commissioner's office to payoff systemTaguba is facing drug charges filed by the National Bureau of Investigation. Eight other personalities have also been charged for their alleged involvement in the smuggling of P6.4-B shabu. They include Filipino-Chinese businessman Chen Lu Jong (alias Richard Chen) who owned the warehouse where drugs were found and caretaker Fidel Anoche Dee, businessmen Dong Yi Shen (alias Kenneth Dong, Li Guang Feng (alias Manny Li), Taiwanese nationals Chen I. Myin and Jhu Minh Jyun, customs broker Teejay Marcellana, and owner of EMT Trading Eirene May Tatad.The ways and means committee said the government lost an estimated P48.3 billion in revenues due to corruption at the BOC while officials amassed P7.7 billion from grease money from July 2016 to July 2017.","Grant Duterte emergency powers to abolish, revamp corrupt customs bureau: House panel"

NBI Investigative Services Deputy Director Vicente de Guzman III reiterated to the hearing that a criminal case of drug possession was filed on August 14.Read more: NBI files drug raps vs. 9 over shabu messSenator Franklin Drilon said this provision is crucial to prevent the drugs from being ""recycled"" and peddled on the streets. Drilon is a member of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee which is investigating the smuggling of P6.4 billion pesos worth of shabu that slipped through customs in May 2017.But almost four months after the 604-kilogram (kg) shabu shipment was seized from two warehouses in Valenzuela City, 502 kgs remain in the custody of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), while 100 kgs are with the PDEA, Thursday's Senate hearing revealed. It was not immediately known where the remaining two kgs are.Drilon quizzed government officials on the status of the massive haul that passed through the Bureau of Customs (BOC) last May.Lawmakers were even more shocked to know that a bigger haul  890 kilos of shabu seized in San Juan City last December 2016  remain undestroyed.Read more: Residents shocked after 6-billion drug bust in a peaceful neighborhoodThe NBI said they have turned over 400 kilos to PDEA, but former PDEA chief and now BOC Commissioner Isidro Lapea said they have received only 300 kilos. Lapea replaced resigned commisioner Nicanor Faeldon, who was cited in contempt by the Senate for skipping Thursday's hearing.Lapea earlier said the PDEA has received and destroyed all 890 kilos of shabu from San Juan, but later corrected himself.Drilon warned PDEA and NBI officials they could face life imprisonment, perpetual disqualification from public office, and a fine of up to P10 million for mishandling confiscated drugs considered as evidence.""We must warn PDEA, the NBI that any public official may be punished by life imprisonment by misapplying or failing to account for the confiscated, seized, or surrendered dangerous drugs,"" he said.Drilon insists seized shabu should be with PDEA, not NBI | https://t.co/sDo55hwVGt pic.twitter.com/cDWJgzU1xs  CNN Philippines (@cnnphilippines) September 7, 2017NBI's De Guzman III said the law allows exemptions in case of a ""justifiable reason,"" which he did not elaborate.He assured senators, ""We have a solid legal ground to back up our possession of this matter.""The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee asked the NBI and PDEA to submit a detailed report on the confiscated shabu when the hearing resumes on Monday.""We have this problem because they are taking for granted compliance with this very clear and strict provisions of the law. Very dangerous,"" Drilon said.Senator Ping Lacson agreed, adding that based on Supreme Court records, a lot of court cases have been dismissed because the evidence were mishandled.In some cases, the drugs were infested by rats, the senators said.Senator Tito Sotto pointed out one ton of white powder from the May 2017 raid is still unaccounted for.""Nililigaw ng nililigaw ng mga pangyayari e, nasan yung isang tonelada ng powder? Mas malaki yun kaysa sa 604 kilos ng shabu,"" Sotto said.(Translation: We are being misled all the more. Where is the one ton of powder? That's even a bigger issue than the 604 kilos of shabu.)Senators have accused Customs fixer Mark Taguba of misleading the probe by alleging a ""tara"" or payoff system at the BOC, naming various officials and aliases who supposedly took bribe money.Gordon called the May 2017 drug raid a ""botched operation"" for lapses that have led to the missing contraband.","Seized shabu 'overstaying' with NBI, PDEA"

He then notified the Bureau of Customs.Customs officials failed to follow protocol when they did not immediately notify the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) of the alleged shipment, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee learned.The PDEA was informed of the shipment on May 26, after customs officials and National Bureau of Investigation had already forced open one of the cylinders, thereby ""contaminating the evidence,"" the committee discovered.Related: PDEA: 6B illegal drugs inadmissible as evidence because of 'contamination'Tan, whose Chinese name is Chen Ju Long, is the owner of Hong Fei Logistics, the warehouse where the drugs were found in.

But do we know what kind of music our ASEAN neighbors are producing?The dominance of Western music notwithstanding, ASEAN Music Festival organizer Annie Luis of the National Commision for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) wanted to put the spotlight on music from ASEAN member states, this time turning to the rich and varied contemporary music made by young musicians from countries such as Laos, Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia.It all started for the 50th anniversary celebration last August, says Luis. When we were assigned to put that program together, the ASEAN Landmark Lighting, we wanted to bring in ASEAN member country representatives, not just Filipinos performing and wearing costumes of the ASEAN states. We realized that its different when you bring in the real performers talaga.With that idea in mind, the NCCA, together with the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) and Gabi Na Naman Productions put together the ASEAN Music Festival, held in conjunction with the 31st ASEAN Summit in Manila. The festival also serves as a breather from the formal proceedings of the five-day meeting of world leaders.Invitations were sent out to the ministries of culture of ASEAN states to choose their own representative for the music festival.We wanted to bring in bands that create their own music and who have at least released albums so we can have a taste of what contemporary music is in our ASEAN region, which we tend to kind of put on the sidelines, says Luis. For this festival, we hope to bring to fore the wealth of artistic talents and contemporary music that we have in ASEAN. We dont have to look to the West first.To the organizers surprise, the resulting roster is a varied mix of performers that give their own take of contemporary music and incorporate elements of traditional music from their own cultures, thus producing distinct genres of their own.The ASEAN Music Festival is a showcase of the unique artistry of music acts all over Southeast Asia but also highlight healthy cross-cultural exchange across the region. Featured bands representing some of the ASEAN member state are (clockwise from upper left): DHask from Brunei, Eint Chit from Myanmar, Nading Rhapsody from Malaysia, Mia Ismi Halida from Indonesia, Asia 7 from Thailand, and Sack Cells from Laos. Photos courtesy of ASEAN MUSIC FESTIVALFor example, Malaysian band Nading Rhapsody is an avant garde Borneo ethnic band that uses myths, tales, and chants from their culture. The bands name is taken from the Dayak tribes god-like character called Nading Grasi who was expelled from the heavens. Nading Rhapsody went on to represent Malaysia in different music festivals around the world. But the band struggles to find a platform to reach a wider audience.When we started Nading Rhapsody as a world music band, there was a different perception and acceptance from people in the music industry in Malaysia, says the bands singer Opha. We had a few struggles to bring our world music to the surface because its always been underground or undiscovered. But now were really happy to see that theres more people coming out [to appreciate] world music [as a] genre.She adds: The best thing is the youth of Malaysia who are picking it up and were proud that people are with us to bring out culture, tradition, and heritage and keep it there and bring it forward for the world to see.Khmer duo Nimith and Sophea also face a similar situation. Chamroeun Sophea and Chhith Sovann Nimith (Ting Tong) provide a modern take on traditional Khmer music and the newly formed duo also want their music to be appreciated by many, especially the younger generation.The traditional seems to be silent, says Tong. We want to adopt it and protect it so we have to combine it. We might be the only one whos trying to do this in our industry. Were not really famous but we want everyone to know us.Bruneis rock band Dhask does not incorporate traditional music in their songs yet but member Syarif Baharudin is familiar with the struggle.It doesnt mean that rock is [from the West], says Baharudin. We have our own rock. We want to let it out, [and show] how Brunei rock sounds like. So for me, thats representing who we are. I have a friend in Brunei, they [use traditional music]. Its actually quite nice. I see my younger sister, she knows the song, so as soon they are into this kind of music, itll be stuck in their head [and then they can show], Oh this is how the original [traditional] song sounds like. Its a stepping stone so they can pick it up. It takes time but we still do it.A lot of young people love pop music. I think as an artist, the best we can do is to use traditional music, live or recording, and use some traditional and ethnic instruments and mix it with new sound, so the young people can listen and feel connected with it.  Mia Ismi Halida, Indonesian artistHailing from an archipelagic nation with 17,000 islands, Mia Ismi Halida of Indonesia also knows how hard it is to create music using her cultures traditions.Each province [in Indonesia] has their own language and traditional music, dance and everything, says Halida. If we travel around the provinces, it feels like were in another country, because the sound, the voice is different. Its rich in culture.But for attempts to put forward traditional music, she says, A lot of young people love pop music. I think as an artist, the best we can do is to use traditional music, live or recording, and use some traditional and ethnic instruments and mix it with new sound, so the young people can listen and feel connected with it.Other ASEAN bands, such as Laos Sack Cells, Thailands Asia 7, Vietnams Tuan Anh, and Myanmars Eint Chit look to the festival as an opportunity to get to know their neighboring states more, and hopefully, create a network of musicians to promote a musical ASEAN region.Eint Chit  who, like Halida, was in Manila for the 50th anniversary celebration of the ASEAN last August  is actually working with a few ASEAN artists on a collaboration to showcase the sound of the region.The last time we were here for the ASEAN anniversary concert, weve been friends with the ASEAN singers, she says. Were still connected with each other even if we went back to our home countries. Right now, were talking about an ASEAN song. It must include the language everyone understands plus our [own] languages. Were planning to do that, just among us, a collaboration. Im already writing something and we can do it in our countries and collaborate [online]. We will make it happen.Get to know more of the music of the regional acts for the ASEAN music festival below.

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1790,334,38896,3676,15,"Manila (CNN Philippines Life)  Drinking beer is a quintessential part of Filipino food culture, an indispensable presence in lifes important occasions. Nothing quite beats the appeal of an inuman to celebrate a milestone, to mark a turning point, or to revel for no reason at all.Manila is no stranger to this vibrant drinking culture, made more apparent by the burgeoning number of bars around the capital, whose patrons come together for the month-long San Miguel Oktoberfest, the longest beer and music festival in the country, now on its 35th year. Elsewhere, outside Manila, beer enthusiasts abound and keep an exciting drinking culture alive.Pampanga celebrates its own version of San Miguel Oktoberfest through the Tigtigan Terakan Keng Dalan, one of the biggest beer, food, music, and street parties in Central Luzon. The festivities commemorate Angeles Citys triumph over the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo as the streets fill up with all sorts of partygoers. Here, overflowing beer does not only keep the party going, but lubricates that sense of community that has helped keep Pampanga resilient despite natural disasters and tragedies.Tigtigan Terakan reminds Carlo Sanchez, a Kapampangan educated in Manila, of the pleasures of home. A typical coming-of-age story for every Kapampangan is to find himself or herself in the world and return home, especially for the holidays, he says. Holidays, such as Tigtigan Terakan, meant coming home to his titos, titas, and cousins based in Manila, bringing home Kapampangan dishes for lunch. Id always wonder when would I be able to join my father and titos as they share stories over sisig and the classic tito drink: San Miguel Pale Pilsen, he recalls.But life comes at you fast, says Sanchez, now a lawyer in Makati. Now I find myself sitting at the tito table and preserving the tradition of my father and forefathers! Home is truly in the small things.A short flight away from Pampanga, Nathan Oducado in General Santos City, South Cotabato is an enterprising businessman who is always up for a round of San Mig Light or Pale Pilsen. He remembers a particular San Miguel Oktoberfest celebrated in Central Food Yard, a popular dining space in GenSan where Oducado keeps a wings-and-shrimp stall called Flip & Pop.Nathan Oducado (right) in a 'business inuman' with fellow entrepreneurs in General Santos City, South Cotabato. Photo courtesy of NATHAN ODUCADO""We would normally start small, like two or three, and each of us taking turns buying one round of drinks, he says. Each time someone joins the group that night, he or she buys another round. The group would reach up to 20 after a few hours. The round of drinks? We forgot.Drinking is a cultural thing in the province, says Oducado. A get-together or celebration, and even one-on-one talks arent as solemn or complete without beer. Drinking entails getting into the differences of each beer and how each variant is suited for a particular mood. We drink different types of beer depending on what mood we want at the end of the night. So if chill lang, San Mig Light, he explains. Pag medyo cold and maalat ang pulutan, Pale Pilsen night. If medyo cheesy yung pulutan, Cervesa Negra. He adds: For rounds, normally San Mig Lights, pero usually ubos so Super Dry or Pale, he laughs.All around the Philippines, beer is not only a social elixir that helps people connect. Its also a formidable ingredient in many dishes. There are quite a few chefs who add a dash of San Miguel beer either to a tasty adobo (as Ilonggo-based JP Anglo does) or to an upgraded oatmeal breakfast (like what Boracay-born Josh Boutwood used to do), or even by way of a Cerveza Negra chocolate cake (from Laguna-based Hiraya Bakery) or a Cerveza Negra gelato (ala Asias 2016 Best Female Chef Margarita Fors).Beer enthusiast Francis Panuncialman knows why he likes his beer. I like beer for its versatility. It has the sweetness from the malt, bitterness from the hops and the refreshing carbonation that goes well with almost anything, he says. I remember making friends when I went to Beer Fest Asia in Singapore where I went solo and suddenly had a group of friends by the end of the night.Beer is an essential social elixir, says Francis Panuncialman.

A friend of mine had a shoot in Antipolo and we had the view Manila that was divine  The nice view plus the cool breeze was perfect while I was spending quality time with friends, he recalls. We spent the night there but before that, we went to the nearest grocery to get some beers. Good thing there was Cervesa Negra!Evidently, theres more to our beer culture than the relentless street partying or occasional inuman. If there is a glue that holds relationships together, most of them will probably be made of San Mig Lights or Pale Pilsens, forged in late nights turned to new mornings.***San Miguel Oktoberfest continues through November.

The jeweler, collector, and tastemaker from Dagupan, Pangasinan, world-renowned for seeing and recreating what can only be simplified as things of beauty, curates an exhibit of 300 objects representing Filipino heritage. One would perhaps need four eyes to fully appreciate the curious collection he has put together, titled Curated by Federico de Vera, which will open on Nov. 6 at the Ayala Museum.At the museum, de Vera is in his element. It took the design alchemist and aesthetic savant with an Enlightenment viewpoint, as the New York Times calls him, more than a year to put together the assortment of paintings and treasures to be housed in three of the museums floors. There are paintings both familiar and strange, in the first floor, where de Vera plans to put works depicting Filipino life: its myths, histories, and faces. Here, I see a Whang-Od portrait by photographer Jake Verzosa. There is even a circa-1970 portrait of Monique Siguion-Reyna, painted by Ang Kiukok, which seems odd and divergent from the artists celebrated body of work.A preview of the first floor, which is themed ""Portrait of the Filipino.""

Photo by KENNETH ABALLADe Vera is not quite an artist (in the conventional sense of the word), but it seems misplaced not to see him as one. He puts faith in the storied weight of objects he finds beautiful. To define beauty is of course, an exercise in futility. But to know what it is is another thing. De Vera sees it in something as mundane, for example, as an aluminum bowl his sister uses to feed the dogs. Or in the many santos that reflect his strict Catholic upbringing, one he now carries lightly. Filipinos are very guilty, he remarks. Of what? I inquire. Of being Catholic, he laughs, as he recalls his childhood.The architecture graduate from the University of Santo Tomas had a family business waiting for him, before he would gradually put up his store of curiosities in New York, with a clientele comprised of the whos who of the worlds biggest names: Hillary Clinton, Karl Lagerfeld, Anne Hathaway, Steve Jobs, and Daniel Day-Lewis, among many, many others.I didnt compromise from the beginning.

What was supposed to be a trip to the U.S. to get an MBA turned out to be a journey of discovery. Im more of a creative type, he says. Instead of taking business classes, I took classes in art history, filmmaking, art appreciation, more liberal arts classes.Starting on his own abroad (after leaving Gallery Japonesque) taught him to trust his own eye. I didnt compromise from the beginning. I was just going to sell what I want, I dont care if it sells or not, he says. It was a gamble, but it paid off. More than two decades later, de Vera is sought not only for his kaleidoscopic eye, but for the stories he tells through his assemblage of objects he finds. In the exhibit notes, de Vera states: The art of placement is also very important, because through a well-thought out exhibition design I can put things in context, weave my story, and present my idea clearly.The 300 objects on exhibit speak of Philippine heritage.

The goal is to provide an experience  one which de Vera is adept at doing  which will hopefully encourage exhibit-goers to appreciate the collection, make connections, and ask questions. Hell be satisfied if I can pull peoples eyes into something: whether its a polychrome wood icon of (and titled) Christ taken down from the cross, a vase of sunflowers made from recycled magazine pages, or a woven Tingguan tapestry from Abra.Its an enviable job. Glimpses of the exhibit can leave one already full  and we havent even seen the treasures of the second floor  so one can just imagine what opening night will look like.

Its only drawing that gets them focused, says Melissa Yeung-Yap, an artist and social entrepreneur who headed art workshops for children in Marawi.Yap was invited to conduct the workshops by Fr. Ben Nebres, S.J., the former president of Ateneo de Manila University, who started a feeding program in Marawi. Fr. Nebres group wanted to have more activities for the children. The kids needed some sort of transition to get back to normalcy so they asked some people to have some activities with the kids, like sports, art, and storytelling, she says.They went to two schools in Lanao del Sur, one in Mipaga Elementary School and another in Saguiaran evacuation center. Yap initially thought that art workshops wouldnt help children in recovering from their trauma or in making sense of all the turmoil that they experienced, but a teacher in Mipaga told her that art was the only way to get them to concentrate in school. Only then did she feel that her presence was not in vain.Now, the artworks of the children  oil pastels on black sandpaper  are displayed in her restaurant, Earth Kitchen, a social enterprise that supports farmers and indigenous communities across the Philippines. Other artworks on display are pieces by children who were victims of Typhoon Yolanda, as well as works by girls from Cribs Foundation, an organization that supports survivors of sexual abuse.""We used sandpaper because we work with kids and they don't really have that much control yet,"" says Melissa Yeung-Yap. ""Sandpaper is the best for kids because it makes everything so vibrant without so much effort on their part.""

Photo by KENNETH ABALLACNN Philippines Life talked to Yap, who is currently based in the U.K., over the phone to learn more about the art workshop she conducted in Marawi, the other workshops she headed for traumatized communities, and how she thinks art facilitates the Maranao childrens return to normalcy. Below are edited excerpts from the interview.What got you started with creating art and also executing art workshops for traumatized communities?I started painting when I was young but I seriously got into it when I was 11 or 12 because I got injured with soccer and I really didn't know what to do during summers. I was bored and I was really down. I enrolled in this art workshop and then I really got into it  My first encounter with an orphanage was during an institutional visit that [my] school, [Immaculate Concepcion Academy], organized.When we were there at the orphanage, we also had this group of street children that they were taking care of so I hung out with them and then we started drawing together  They had a blackboard, and the kids and I had chalks, and then we created a nice collage of sort and it was really nice. Then they asked me to go back there, so I did for every summer for the next five years  They really sparked my interest and they gave me this purpose of sharing my art with others.What was it like being in Marawi and interacting with the children?It was a bit surreal and a bit scary, but not really. When you're with the kids, you kind of forget that it's scary because they were really fun and happy  We were just supposed to teach in Saguiaran [a municipality in Lanao farther from the war zone] but then we went to Mipaga [in Marawi]. Our van had all the materials so we just landed and [the teacher] was super thankful so it was really nice. It gave so much meaning to what we were trying to do because she said that art really helped the kids recover and get back on track with school.""That was the only thing they had left  the clothes they had when they literally ran away from the war zone. But despite that, they can still interact with us and share so much despite everything.""  Melissa Yeung-YapI was actually talking to the teacher earlier because we got to raise some funds, and she said she needed to buy printers and some books because they lost everything. The kids are getting enrolled again so there are more enrollees now because some of the people from the evacuation centers are now back in Mipaga and are enrolling their kids again.What was the common theme that the children were drawing and why did you choose sandpaper and pastel as art tools?A lot of them drew houses because they lost their homes, so that was bittersweet in the sense that their families are really important and their homes are really important, but then that was a bit heartbreaking.We used sandpaper because we work with kids and they don't really have that much control yet, and sandpaper helps make the color more vibrant. I tried several types of surfaces and sandpaper is the best for kids because it makes everything so vibrant without so much effort on their part. Crayons on paper wouldn't be as vibrant and it's different also for them to explore different surfaces.Melissa Yeung-Yap was initially invited by Fr. Ben Nebres of Ateneo to think of activities for the children of Marawi, as Fr. Nebres initiated a feeding program. The kids needed some sort of transition to get back to normalcy so they asked some people to have some activities with the kids, like sports, art, and storytelling, she says. Photo by KENNETH ABALLAA Maranao child's drawing of what is presumably a sarimanok, an iconic Maranao figure. Photo by KENNETH ABALLAWhat was the most revealing for you when you were doing the workshops?It's their resilience. It was really amazing because they've been through so much and yet simple things like art or our simple visit there  they really showed so much gratitude. For us, it wasn't really much. We're trying to share whatever we can but we know it's not enough, but the gratitude they showed towards us really shows how much gratitude they have despite everything or how much happiness they still got to keep despite everything that happened to them.Of course, when we talk to the moms about what happened, they'd still get teary-eyed and everything. Some didn't know what to do next. They practically only had the clothes they had. That was the only thing they had left  the clothes they had when they literally ran away from the war zone. But despite that, they can still interact with us and share so much despite everything. That really struck me.Youve headed workshops for communities that are often victim of various kinds of trauma. How do you think art facilitates their transition to normalcy?Art helps express things that words cannot express. It's like another medium of expression. For these [Maranao] kids, it's so hard for them to verbalize things sometimes, and it helps to be able to provide this new avenue for them to be able to do that. And there, they could be free to do whatever they want but at the same time, what we did was we taught them some skills because it's so hard to just ask them to draw their feelings if they don't know exactly how to do that.Earth Kitchen supports farmers and indigenous communities across the Philippines. Other artworks on display are pieces by children who were victims of Typhoon Yolanda, as well as works by girls from Cribs Foundation, an organization that supports survivors of sexual abuse. Photo by KENNETH ABALLAWhat we do usually is to teach them some basic skills and it gave them so much confidence knowing that they can do this now  because that's the same thing that happened to me before and I couldn't express how sad I was from getting injured. Art helped me express things so hopefully it helps them do that as well.What was the most gratifying thing about doing and finishing the art workshops with the children in Marawi?When we went there, I wasn't really sure how helpful art was going to be for them. I wasn't sure how much of a difference we were going to make but when I talked to the teachers  and when I saw the kids drawing and when [the teacher] told me that, Oh Im not really an art teacher but I'm making them draw because that's all I can make them do right now, it gave so much meaning to what we were trying to do and how much impact art has to people, especially children who can't really express themselves so much in other ways.It motivated me, together with other artists, to continue what we're doing in Marawi and other areas. What's inspiring is that even if I'm away now, another group of artists got inspired and they're going there sometime this October. They're just fixing logistics  I think I'm happy that it gave courage to other artists to also do that.***Earth Kitchen is located along Katipunan Ave., Quezon City.

The company hasn't done enough to attract users on Android, the dominant platform in many international markets. And its transition to an automated advertising system has been bumpier than expected for sales.The problems were evident in Snap's dismal third quarter results. Its losses more than tripled, sales fell short of Wall Street's estimates and the audience has flatlined. Snapchat added just 4.5 million new daily active users in the three month period.Spiegel is now planning to redesign the Snapchat app. Or to put that another way: Snap is planning a massive overhaul of its core product and primary moneymaker just eight months after it raised billions in a public offering. Call it the corporate equivalent of a Hail Mary pass.""There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application,"" Spiegel said on the call.Related: Snapchat plans major redesign as user growth stallsThe stock dipped as much as 20% in after hours trading Tuesday. Snap pared its losses somewhat Wednesday on news of Chinese tech giant Tencent amassing a 10% stake in the company, but shares were still down 15% in early trading.So how could Snap and Spiegel have gotten it so wrong? The answer may be a mix of hubris and shortsightedness.Consider Spiegel's response to yet another setback: Spectacles. The smart sunglasses marked Snap's first foray into hardware and enjoyed some buzz early on. But on Tuesday, Snap said it was taking a nearly $40 million writedown for excess inventory of the product after misjudging demand.""We were very excited about Spectacles by the initial reception, [and] because we were so excited we made I guess the wrong decision,"" Spiegel said on the call. ""Ultimately, we weren't able to sell as many Spectacles as we thought we had been able to based on our early adoption.""Ross Gerber, the CEO of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, was blunt in his assessment: ""Management is garbage."" (Shortly after the call, The Information reported Snap's head of engineering is stepping down.)Even those who remain positive on the company suggest its leadership has been in some form of denial until now.""We wouldn't be so quick to write off Snap just yet,"" James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi Hardt, wrote in an investor note Wednesday.

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1790,334,38896,3676,15,"(CNN Money)  Will the iPhone X change your life for the better and usher you into the future, face first? Or is it just another smartphone with a giant screen and a strange little rectangle on top?We've only had the phone since Monday morning. It's more than the few minutes of hands-on time reporters had when the device was launched, but a day is not enough time to fairly review the iPhone X. It's like deciding if you want to marry someone after one blind date.So while we test, tinker and tap this week, here are some first impressions to whet your appetite, presented as yearbook superlatives:Most likely to annoy youCall it what you like  a cutout or a notch  but the area around the new front-facing cameras and sensors is definitely a black mark on the iPhone X's screen. In the battle over bezels (the frame around a smartphone screen), Apple seems to have gone a little too far to push its screen to the very edges of the device.If you watch a widescreen movie, you can shrink it down so everything is visible and get a box just barely larger than what you'd see on an iPhone 8 Plus. But if you double tap it to fill the screen, the black bar will block out a tiny bit of the image. The corners of the screen are also rounded, gently shaving off any corners of apps or content.In an era when all smartphones look nearly identical in their cases, you could argue the black bar gives the iPhone X screen a distinctive look. But I'd rather just watch my movie without a little gap in the display.Related: Apple's Jony Ive: Some people 'misuse' iPhonesHardest to warm up toFace detection is the iPhone X's signature feature. Setting it up is easier than adding a fingerprint. It works, but seems to slow down the unlocking process. It's one of those things I'll need more time to get used to before I decide if it's actually an improvement of just a gimmick to make the iPhone X seem futuristic enough to justify all the hype and that $1,000 price tag.Most attractive new additionIt's you! Your face can now get the ""Portrait Mode"" treatment when using the front-facing camera. Also known as the ""selfie"" camera, it's now able to mimic the same shallow depth-of-field effect as the back camera. A perfect time-sucking addition for selfie fans.Related: iPhone X pre-orders up to a six week waitOddest security issueApple hopes you don't have an untrustworthy identical twin. The company says its face detection feature is far more secure than fingerprint sensors, with a one-in-a-million chance of someone fooling it. However, the company acknowledges that it can be tricked by identical twins. It's also not as effective for children under 13. That could be disappointing for any pre-teens planning to drop a thousand dollars on a smartphone.Most likely to be forgotten (a k a, The class clown)Ironically, the under-13 set is the group most likely to enjoy texting animated pieces of sentient poop to their pals. Apple's new Animoji feature uses the face detection technology to animate 12 popular emojis in Messages, including a robot, a unicorn, a pig, and a fox. It's cute!Developers can use the same technology in their own apps. Snapchat is one of the first, with masks that map to your face. The Face ID camera has a ton of fun potential just waiting to be tapped by other apps, but I suspect the novelty of Apple's Animoji will wear off quickly.I could be wrong. We might be communicating entirely in animated emojis in five years, in which case I will apologize with an appropriately humbled animated unicorn head.Most delightful detail you'll never noticeTo set it apart from the iPhone 8, the back of the X has an ""optical layer"" that adds a subtle glimmer to the glass surface, which is designed to work with inductive charging devices. Unfortunately, if you break the glass on either side, it will cost more to replace on the iPhone X than previous models. You're safest keeping it in a case and missing out on the shine.Related: iPhone X screen repair: That'll be $275Biggest inconvenienceThe new and improved Control Center was my favorite addition in iOS 11. But things have shifted on the iPhone X to work around the missing Home button. To bring up the control center, you need to tap and drag down from the top right corner of the screen. It's not thumb friendly, unless you have unusually long thumbs. When it appears, it's higher on the screen than when you swipe up. One clumsy workaround is to use the Reachability setting, which moves everything on the screen down.We're still testing out the phone and will be back later with a full review and a camera comparison. The iPhone X arrives in stores Friday. There's already a lengthy wait for online orders, but you might be able to get one in person at an Apple Store or retailer.This story was first published on CNN.com, ""iPhone X first impressions: The highs, lows and quirks.""","iPhone X first impressions: The highs, lows and quirks"

I was able to come out, I don't know how.""The horrors Mumtaz says she endured didn't stop there. After escaping the mass grave, Mumtaz says she was dragged to a village house and raped by soldiers. The wooden house was then locked and set on fire.It was her seven-year-old daughter Razia, who was in the hut, that ultimately saved her.""I called to my mum. And my mum said, 'who are you?,'"" Razia says. ""My mother's head was split. She was thrown aside. They struck me and threw me aside.""""I said 'your finger is on fire.' Then my mum and I got out and left.""The pair squeezed through a damaged part of a fence and hid in a vegetable patch, before other villagers found them and helped them get to Bangladesh, where a staggering 615,000 Rohingya refugees have fled since August 25, according to aid agencies.The refugees have escaped violent clashes in the north of Rakhine State, where Myanmar's military has intensified what it calls ""clearance operations"" targeting ""terrorists"" after Rohingya militants attacked police posts, killing 12 security officials.The UN calls what's happening in Rakhine a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and the killings that took place in Mumtaz's village on August 30 have been described as one of the worst atrocities of the past two and a half months.Documenting a massacreShafiur Rahman, a Bangladeshi-British documentary maker, first heard about what occurred at Tula Toli after he filmed a group of Rohingya crossing the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh on September 2, three days after the killings.The dramatic footage shows dozens of men and women clambering across barbed wire fences into no man's land, some of them covered in blood and carrying dead or injured relatives. Their distress is palpable.""It quickly became clear to me that those telling me the most horrific accounts of their last few days were those coming from Tula Toli,"" Rahman tells CNN. ""And what also struck me was the consistency in their stories.""He met Mumtaz and Razia in Bangladesh in late September. Almost mummified in bandages, Mumtaz had spent 15 days bed- bound in a clinic, unable to speak or even sip a glass of water. By mid-October, the horrific burns all over her face and body started to slowly heal, and Mumtaz began to share her story with Rahman in a series of interviews.Accounts of mass rape, murder and arson have been given by many of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who have escaped Myanmar.But the testimonies Rahman has collected from a total of 30 Tula Toli residents over the past two months, and detailed in this report depict what Amnesty International describes in an October report as ""what appears to be one of the worst atrocities of the Army's ethnic cleansing campaign.""""Amnesty International believes, based on consistent, corroborating witness accounts, that soldiers massacred at least scores of Rohingya women, men, and children from Min Gyi on 30 August,"" the Amnesty report concludes. Min Gyi is another name for Tula Toli.Amnesty also released satellite images showing the village before and after the houses were burnt.'They won't kill anyone'One of Myanmar's poorest regions, Rakhine State is home to the mostly Muslim Rohingya and the Rakhines, a predominantly Buddhist ethnic group.The two have lived side by side in Tula Toli for generations although long-simmering tensions have often erupted into violence in the region. The estimated 1.1 million Rohingya have been denied citizenship in Myanmar, which regards them as Bengali. Bangladesh insists they are from Myanmar, rendering them effectively stateless.In detailed video interviews and conversations, most of the 30 survivors told Rahman that they were given assurances by local officials that they would be safe if they remained in their village.Mohammed Nasir said he was told: ""They might torch the houses, but they won't kill anyone.""Residents describe helicopters landing near the village at 8 a.m. on the morning of August 30. The soldiers were joined by around 50 Rakhine Buddhists and other non-Rohingya minorities from outside the village, survivors said.""They asked us to gather on the beach,"" Nasir says, describing the sandy bank of the meandering river that runs through Tula Toli. He saw the killings unfold from a hill.""When they saw people gathering, they went straight for them. They were shooting continuously, at the same time the houses were burning.Cellphone footage shows Tula Toli residents heading to the river in their village on August 30, where witnesses say many were shot later that day.Another resident, Rehana Begum, said she was also told to leave her home and stay near the river.""They kept us there by saying that they would do us no harm,"" Begum says. ""At 8 a.m., a helicopter landed and the village was besieged. Whoever was able to flee, they fled.""""(The military) surrounded us suddenly and we could not escape because of the river. The tide was high. There were no boats. Since my brothers could carry my children, I was able to swim and flee,"" she says.""Many were shot, scores got hit and they fell on their face,"" Rehana said. ""Those lying on the ground were picked up, chopped and later they were thrown into the river.""Hasina, a Rohingya woman from Tula Toli, says the soldiers and their accomplices threw her one-year-old daughter Sohaifa on a fire while she was still alive.""They tore her from my arms,"" Hasina says, breaking down into tears. ""They threw her into a burning pile of clothes. They had started a fire using people's belongings. And they threw her into the big burning pile.""Her husband had been working outside the village when the killings took place and later reunited with his wife in Bangladesh, where he found out about the death of their only child.CNN cannot verify the accounts of the refugees, as access to Rakhine State is heavily restricted.Peace deal signedMore than a week before the attack on the village, Rohingya village officials say there was a meeting on August 18, in which both Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims from Tula Toli signed a peace agreement.While the village, which is home to 4,360 Rohingya and 435 Rakhines, hadn't seen any clashes in recent years, Rakhine officials said they wanted to allay Rohingya fears given tensions between the two groups elsewhere in the state and a recent military build up, the survivors told Rahman.""A resolution was passed to not attack each other and live peacefully. It was signed by both sides, Rakhine and us,"" said Nur Kabir, the current secretary of Tula Toli's village administration, who is now in Bangladesh.""But they attacked on Wednesday starting at 8 a.m. and killed us.""The survivors say their trust in that peace agreement signed days before, and in the village authorities, was obliterated when the military arrived early on the morning of August 30. Those who escaped estimate that between 1,500 to 1,700 people died that day.Rahman believes, given the instructions of local officials, the peace deal and the military build-up in the area before August 25, that the attack on Tula Toli was pre-planned. He calls it a ""terrifying and inescapable notion"" that undermines the repeated insistence from Myanmar authorities that the military were responding to attacks from Rohinya insurgents.Zaw Htay, the spokesperson for Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said that local Rakhines and the military had been targeted by insurgents in Tula Toli.""We could verify that on 30 August 2017 in Min Gyi (Tular Tuli) village, there were a total of eight attacks against Rakhine population and security forces by hundreds of terrorists,"" Zaw Htay said.Previously, Myanmar's government has denied charges of ethnic cleansing, saying that the military took ""full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians"" in Rakhine State.In a televised speech on September 19, Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace prize laureate who took power in 2015 in a power-sharing agreement with the military, said she ""condemned all human rights violations,"" but failed to address alleged atrocities by the military.She now faces increased scrutiny ahead of the visit of the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, on Wednesday, who has said he is ""extraordinarily concerned about the situation.""Pope Francis, who has spoken out repeatedly in defense of the Rohingya, will also meet with Suu Kyi during a visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh later in November.Bleak futureMumtaz is slowly recovering from her burns and other injuries in Bangladesh, but faces a desperate future.Conditions in the border camps are bleak, with aid agencies struggling to provide enough food, shelter and healthcare in what the UN has described as the world's fastest growing refugee crisis and a major humanitarian emergency.She and Razia now have only each other. In the carnage, Mumtaz says her husband was shot by the riverside. One of her three sons was thrown into a fire. The other two were killed in the wooden hut that Razia and Mumtaz escaped from.""My brother and the others were burnt,"" Razia says. ""They were killed by being smashed. They shot dead my dad.""Razia's head is scarred with the blows she received. But worse is the mental trauma of the memories, which are still raw.""She saw.

(FAI) said it is targeting this thriving market segment with its newest office development: the 32-storey Parkway Corporate Center in Filinvest City, Alabang.This is the first office condominium under the WorkSpaces by Filinvest banner that offers investors pre-selling units for sale in a dynamic environment.Designed by leading architectural firm H1 Architecture and Design, Parkway Corporate Center comes with office units averaging 36 square meters.Allowing for flexibility and combinability depending on the need, FAI said Parkway Corporate Center is perfect for boutique companies and SMEs. Other future-ready facilities include six high-speed elevators, 24-hour security with CCTV cameras, 100 percent back-up power and an advanced fiber-optic backbone.As with all Filinvest projects, extensive studies and research were put into envisioning Parkway Corporate Center. A significant take-away is how creating healthier and greener offices can ease the impact on the companys bottom line.For instance, a well-ventilated office that has plenty of windows for greater exposure to daylight and natural views has been proven to improve employee productivity, based on a study by Harvard University.Accordingly, Parkway Corporate Center is fitted with expansive, double-glazed, glass-curtain walls with a low-e coating that lowers heat and UV radiation.It also has breakout spaceslike the podium deck on the 7 floor, a pocket garden on the ground floor and balconies on every five floorsallowing tenants and employees to enjoy Filinvest Citys verdant surroundings.FAI said all these and more are in keeping with its vision to achieve a LEED certification, the most recognized green building rating system across the globe.Indeed, its only fitting that Parkway Corporate Center is located in Filinvest City, a thriving, fully-integrated and self-contained 244-hectare metropolis that harmonizes modern conveniences with nature.FAI said Filinvest City is a genuine work-live-play environment that is fast reinforcing its stature as the ultimate green citysustainable, pedestrian friendly and eco-centric.With all these advantages, companies looking to move into a green office development should look no further than Parkway Corporate Centerthe smart, eco-oriented corporate tower of the south.For more information, call 809-6517 or visit www.parkwaycorporate.com",How going green can really pay back

But instead of leafy, green trees, the jungles of enterprise in the country have generally become associated with huge plate-glass windows and acres of concrete.However, one business district has been bucking that trend for over two decades. And it's only a 20-minute drive south from Makati.Filinvest City, Alabang's premier CBD, is striving to become recognized as a global garden city as it applies for the country's first-ever Gold certification in Neighborhood Development in the prestigious Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.LEED, which is managed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council, recognizes designs that are environmentally responsible from construction to maintenance.The company said it registered for the program in May 2017 and is hoping to get certification soon.In the past number of years, Filinvest City has been quite busy transforming itself to what it is today  dynamic, growing, and a true green city, said Catherine Ilagan, Executive Vice-President of Filinvest Alabang, Inc. (FAI), the developer of Filinvest City.In a separate statement, FAI told CNN Philippines that the LEED certification will be an affirmation that we have been doing this right from the start.Its green features were put in place for the ultimate benefit of residents and locators, all towards the goal of making Filinvest City an ideal community, one that is balanced and eco-sustainable,"" the company also said.Green ever sinceFilinvest said it is able to vie for the recognition because it has continuously fulfilled the vision of the late Filinvest Development Corporation founder Andrew Gotianun Sr.Filinvest City is committed to continue what our founder Andrew Gotianun Sr. has started, how he envisioned Filinvest City to be, Ilagan said. All these efforts now are done to strengthen our position as the only garden CBD in Metro Manila and we are continuously raising the bar to be globally competitive and give more breathing room to our locators and residents through our garden city efforts.In 2012, Filinvest reassessed the city's masterplan, which included retaining verdant and wide-open fields, thousands of plants and even a ""living creek"" coursing through Filinvest City, as seen in Festival Mall.In addition, Filinvest manages everything in the city from landscaping to security, ensuring minimal harm to the environment.Meanwhile, the company's investments in building wide streets and sidewalks, as well as accessible public transportation, have made Filinvest City a true model in mobility, especially with the lack of traffic jams (the envy of many in Metro Manila).The company said these factors will not only help with its vying for LEED certification but will also provide Filinvest City an identity that is unmistakably its own -- a place where people can balance work, leisure and living.A greener tomorrowBut if you think all this focus on being green has turned businesses away, you'd be wrong.Since Filinvest City initiated its masterplan enhancement in 2012, over 50 new developments have been added to the CBD's portfolio.Upcoming developments include Filinvest Axis, the high-end, residential Botanika Nature Residences and Vector Three, which has been awarded a Gold certification for an office development.Despite these accomplishments, the company said it's not done innovating what could arguably be the greenest CBD in the country.Future plans include making Filinvest City a truly walkable space by building parks and walkways that would allow visitors to explore all 244 hectares by foot.We want to be known and experienced as a breathing, model green city, Ilagan said. All that we're doing -- enhancing our open spaces and greens, cultivating progress with new developments and adding infrastructure -- these are all focused efforts to nurture a true sense of community.Indeed, Filinvest City shows that thinking ahead will truly pay off in the future.",Filinvest City eyes to be first LEED Gold-certified neighborhood in PH

But the Department of Health (DOH) said patients are allowed to import drugs and other devices not yet available in the country, including processed cannabis for medical purposes.The Food and Drug Adminsitration (FDA), an agency under the DOH, gives out compassionate special permits under the its Administrative Order no.4s.1992. These permits grant hospitals ""the privilege to avail of an unregistered drug, medical device, or food product through a licensed importer for a specific kind/type of patients, specific volume and period.""Paolo Tonolete, an FDA regulation officer, says doctors or hospitals can apply for a permit on behalf of a patient with cancer, HIV-AIDS, and other life-threatening diseases.""The DOH and FDA deemed it morally, socially, and ethically justified to allow access of these unregistered drug products. It is the right of every Filipino to have access to these meds especially terminally ill,"" he said .The FDA receives an average of 50 applications a month for compassionate special permits, mostly for cancer medication.In 2016, 558 of of 565 applications were approved.As of September 30 this year, only two of 585 applications were denied.""There were applications denied because the drug product being requested has an available counterpart, meaning we have a similar drug already registered and sold in the Philippine market,"" Tonolete explained.Since these special permits were first issued in 1992, the FDA has received only one application to import cannabis oil. When the FDA asked the applicant for more details, the applicant did not reply.Tonolete says the importation of cannabis oil is prohibited.""Our position maintains that what's allowed in medical cannabis is only in processed form, where active ingredients are really measured and allowed for specific therapeutic action or level of cure. We minimize possible risks or side effects with this approach,"" he said.Expensive cannabis-based drugsThe Philippine Cannabis Compassion Society (PCCS) tells CNN Philippines at least three of its members tried and failed to get a compassionate special permit from the FDA to import cannabis oil.Anna Kapunan, a member of the PCCS executive committee, says many of their colleagues prefer to import cannabis oil because there are only a few cannabis-based drugs available in markets abroad, making them very expensive.According to Kapunan, Sativex, an oromucosal spray for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, costs 32,340 ($1,656,778) for a month's supply. Since the FDA only approves bulk importation, this would amount to 194,060 for a six-month supply.Another cannabis-based drug for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, Drobanidol or Marinol, is priced at 53,824/month or almost 323,000 for a half-year supply.Even as the government intensifies its campaign against illegal drugs, the PCCS vows to continue pushing for the legalization of medical marijuana in the country, including its cultivation and manufacture.""Mahigpit ang war on drugs ngayon, sabi nila suntok sa buwan daw pinaglaaban namin kasi marijuana. Sana magbago ang isip ng mga tao na pang-adik lang iyon, kasi gamot siya eh,"" says PCCS spokesperson, Dr. Donnabel Cunanan.[Translation: ""With the intensified war on drugs, they say what we're fighting for is impossible because it's marijuana. We hope they change their thinking that marijuana is just for addicts because it's a medicine.""]The country's biggest group of doctors, the 76,000-strong Philippine Medical Association (PMA), insists there are many drugs in the market for diseases that medical cannabis is claimed to treat.The group also says more tests and research should be done to confirm the medical properties of cannabis.""In the Philippines, without a thorough study on the matter  evidence-based studies, the medical profession can't just accept anything as basis. Testimonials are not enough,"" says PMA president, Dr. Irineo Bernardo.Medical cannabis bill in CongressBefore the House of Representatives went on recess, House Bill No. 180 or the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act was scheduled for sponsorship and interpellation at the plenary but this was postponed as the chamber got busy with other matters.In the Senate, Majority Leader Tito Sotto said a medical cannabis bill would face rough sailing because there is not enough scientific basis to justify the use of marijuana to cure or alleviate certain illnesses. He also points to the FDA compassionate special permits, stressing there's no need for a new law.""Ginagamit mo cannabis, gumaling ka? Eh di bumili ka. Huhulihin ka ba namin? Di ka naman huhulihin eh, bakit idadamay mo kami? Ikaw lang makikinabang. Ikaw lang ang may sakit Once binigyan na natin, nabukas na pintuan for medical marijuana to be legalized.

Maganda po 'yung mga ginagawa,"" he said.In September, Cimatu called on Metro Manila's nearly 13 million residents to practice waste segregation and to change habits when it comes to disposing of solid waste.""Let us segregate waste and stop indiscriminate dumping; it is simple to do and requires just a bit of discipline,"" he said then.Wanton dumping of trash is also the main reason for persistent flooding on Metro Manila's streets when rain falls, since the trash clogs sewer and drainage systems.Floodwaters rose and tons of trash floated into streets when Typhoon Lannie and Tropical Storm Maring hit Luzon, including Metro Manila in September.""As citizens, we also need to do our part by simply disposing of our trash properly,"" Cimatu said.How to segregate wasteHere's how to get started on recycling and segregating waste.A practical and helpful way to dispose of your plastics: Make ecobricks!Join upcoming training sessions in the Philippines on EcobricksPayatas landfill closed in SeptemberCimatu's predecessor, Gina Lopez, ordered in 2016 the closure of the Payatas landfill due to its proximity to the La Mesa Dam, a source of the metro's drinking water.""We have to close Payatas landfill because it already exceeded its limit,"" Cimatu said, adding that this landfill was due for closure as early as 2013.Before the Payatas landfill was closed in September, a previous trash site also in Payatas that was operating from the 1970s was the scene of a tragic incident in July 2000, where some 300 people, mostly trashpickers, were buried in a landslide of trash.""Nu'ng umuulan nga noon nang malakas, nagtawag sa'kin 'yung MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) na medyo delikado na mag-landslide uli,"" Cimatu said.""Katulad nu'ng nangyari several years back na mga 300 ang namatay, natabunan ng basura,"" he added.The other landfill in Navotas which serves the rest of Metro Manila also poses a problem due to the mode of transporting trash.""The problem in that landfill is that the waste, the garbage is transported by barge in Pier 18. They bring these to the landfill in Navotas,""Cimatu said.""During the transportation of this garbage, we have noted that there are some accidental things that happen when the garbage fall towards the Manila Bay. And it again increased the pollutants in the Manila Bay. So we were taking actions on these,"" he added.Under Republic Act No. 9003 or the Ecological SolidWaste Management Act of 2000, local government units are primarily responsible for waste segregation and disposal, but all Filipinos are enjoined to do their share in cleaning their surroundings.Waste-to-energy method studiedThe Environment Secretary said they are considering studying waste-to-energy methods of garbage disposal.""That will be our plan to put up really this kind of waste (to) energy because ito na nga ang trend nila sa mga other countries.He said he traveled two weeks ago to the towns of Minglanilla, Carcar, and Naga in Cebu to see how this worked.""Dinadala nila sa machine nila, inilalagay doon for ano, nag-ano 'yun eh, nag  through chemical process, nagkaroon ng methane 'yun eh, nagme-methane, naka-generate ng electricity.

When Servando visited the wake of Castillo's son, Atio, he was reminded of his own child, whom he had to bury more than three years ago.""I'm sorry it doesn't. It doesn't end,"" Servando told Castillo.Servando and Castillo's son were around the same age. They studied in two of the top universities in the Philippines - but Servando says the boys were similar in other ways.""He (Castillo) obviously, is also very kind, and very loving, and he also loves dogs,"" Servando said. ""He was also chubby, by the way.""But there was one thing Servando wished Atio didn't share with his late son Guillo: To die in the hands of his supposed brothers.Guillo Servando was just 18 and a sophomore at De La Salle College of St. Benilde when he died in 2014, after the initiation rites of the Tau Gamma Phi fraternity.Twenty-two year old University of Santo Tomas (UST) law freshman Horacio ""Atio"" Castillo III, meanwhile, died while attending the ""welcome party"" of Aegis Juris Fraternity, an organization based in the UST College of Civil Law.While authorities are chasing suspects in Atio's death, lawmakers are conducting investigations to amend the 22-year-old law which was supposed to protect Atio, Guillo, and at least 17 others who died in the ""spirit"" of brotherhood - Republic Act 8049, an act which only regulates hazing.18 deaths, 393 suspects, 1 convictionThe death of Ateneo de Manila student Leonardo Lenny Villa in 1991 after the initiation rites of Aquila Legis Juris Fraternity prompted the creation of the existing Anti-Hazing Law.The case, which was only closed in 2012, led to the conviction of five accused - a 21-year battle for Villa's family.However, the first - and only conviction so far - under R.A. 8049 is the case of University of the Philippines Los Banos student Marlon Villanueva in 2006 in the hands of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. The case, which sentenced the two suspects to reclusion perpetua, was decided in 2015.The case of Servando may also be up for a long wait as it is still on appeal after the Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 53 dismissed it in 2016 due to technicalities.""The judge believes that one of the essential elements of hazing cases was the mention in the information portion of the case. He said in his decision that the phrase, 'as a prerequisite for admission to fraternities' should have been included,"" Servando explained. ""The phrase that was used by the Department of Justice when they filed the case was, 'in the final initiation of,'"" he added.Legal loopholesSenator Juan Miguel Zubiri, along with other critics, have pointed out legal loopholes in the current anti-hazing law.One of this is the failure of the law to ban hazing outright.However, the anti-hazing law's principal author, former senator Joey Lina, said the law was meant to ""address a gap in our legal system.""""What is that gap? There is no crime called hazing, whether under the Revised Penal Code (RPC), or under the special laws,"" Lina said, adding the suspects in the Lenny Villa case was punished with reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, with a penalty of imprisonment of 4 months up to 4 years and 2 days.Another example, Lina said, was the need to prove intent.Prior to the passage of the anti-hazing law, the former senator said the cases which can be filed against those involved in hazing are murder, homicide, serious physical injuries, less serious physical injuries, or slight physical injuries, all of which required proving intent.""This present law has an underlying shift in philosophy. We will not charge anymore the persons accused in hazing under the RPC. It will be under a special law, and this (anti-hazing law) is the special law. The objective is for the prosecution and the police not to prove anymore the intent to kill,"" Lina said.For Lina, it is not about the law but the system itself.""It's a question of the entire criminal justice system. A law is only as good as it is enforced or implemented,"" Lina said.Filling the gapsThe separate probes in the Senate and the House of Representatives on Atio's case were meant to strengthen the anti-hazing law.Lina said he welcomes the possible amendments, but warned against scrapping the entire law.""There are two serving sentences under the existing anti-hazing law. there are 300 suspects at large according to the Philippine National Police. If the law is revoked or annulled, what will be the case? They will go scot free. There are pending cases now in court which will be affected by a move to scrap the law altogether,"" Lina said.Senator Ping Lacson, head of the committee that probed on Castillo's case, assured they will not repeal the law.Meanwhile, for the grieving Servando, the country still has ""a lot of work to do"" regarding the criminal justice system.""I liken it to a bamboo pole that can be turned left or right, front and back. Our justice in the Philippines is very subjective. If you have a good lawyer who could interpret the law in a way that will favor you, it can be done.

I think that helped ensure more cordial discussions between the two,"" he told ANC Wednesday.White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders earlier said human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines fight against illegal drugs during the discussion between the two leaders Monday.The Philippines and the US later issued a joint statement saying human rights and dignity are ""essential"" as they recognized the drug problem as a mutual concern.During discussions between Trump and Duterte, both sides agreed to discuss a free trade agreement and to enhance defense ties. The two sides also expressed mutual condemnation of North Korea's ""unlawful"" nuclear weapons and missile development program.While the US President skipped the issue, it was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who ""impressed"" upon Duterte the need to respect the rule of law and human rights during informal talks Tuesday.While Trudeau said Duterte was ""receptive,"" the President said he was insulted by this move.Cuisia meanwhile anticipated that Trump may draw flak for not pressing on human rights issues during his meeting with Duterte, as some US lawmakers had sought.""Definitely, members of the US Congress will of course be giving Trump flak for that decision he made. But that was his desire to ensure a more fruitful talk with Duterte,"" Cuisia added.Duterte, who has been criticized for alleged extrajudicial killings under his drug war, earlier said he would not take any lecturing from foreign leaders on human rights when he attended the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Vietnam.The administration has repeatedly defended the drug war, saying it does not sanction summary killings or condone police abuses.","Skipping human rights issues allowed cordial talks between Trump, Duterte, says former envoy"

This category also includes those killed in in flagrante delicto cases (in the very act of committing a crime) and apprehensions that reportedly escalated to a shootout.b) Killed by unidentified assailants: the individuals tagged in drugs were killed by unidentified assailants in shooting incidents or by motorcycle-riding gunmen. The incident was either witnessed by other people or captured on CCTV.c) Bodies found away from the crime scene: the victims' bodies were discovered with a label tagging them in drug-related activities (usually a cardboard bearing the words ""drug pusher"", ""drug user"" or ""drug addict"") or there are illegal drugs reportedly recovered from the body. The victims' faces and bodies usually bear gunshot wounds, and sometimes even stab wounds. The victims' arms or legs, or both, are also usually bound and the bodies wrapped in tape.The proportion of each category relative to the total death toll is illustrated in the pie chart. The heat map illustrates the magnitude of drug-related deaths per province/city: the redder the color of a province/city in the map, the higher the number of drug-related deaths reported in that area.The table meanwhile, shows the names and aliases of those who were killed, as well as the dates and areas where the killings took place. Each column in the table is sortable.The data on the map, charts, and table are interconnected.

She then got the video edited - removing the woman but retaining images of the 8 rapists and uploaded it on YouTube to shame the attackers.Two years on, however, she is hopeful that circulation of rape content on social media will become more difficult.Responding to her petition against rape videos, India's Supreme Court has made recommendations drawn up by a court-appointed committee including staff of Facebook and Whatsapp.The court asked internet companies to provide technical support to law enforcement agencies investigating such crimes and to ensure warning messages pop up for key words people use to search for rape videos and child sexual abuse online.It has also suggested a central body where all the complaints can be registered.""There will be a good amount of deterrence to circulate offensive videos. This is the beginning,"" Krishnan said.",From streets to smartphones: India grapples with 'online rape'

The government needs to reverse this ban and uphold the rule of law and refuse to capitulate to arbitrary actions by the military.""The order, issued by Yangon Region Security and Border Affairs Minister Colonel Aung Soe Moe, instructs authorities in 11 townships to deny all applications for assemblies. It does not say how long the curb will last.A senior official from the military-run General Administration Department in Yangon's Ahlone Township confirmed that his office has received the order. He declined to be named as he's not authorized to speak to the media.Reuters was unable to contact Yangon's police deputy chief by telephone. The office of Yangon's chief minister Phyo Min Thein declined to comment.A Myanmar court last week jailed for two months two journalists along with their interpreter and driver for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone.Police on Sunday arrested an ultra-nationalist Buddhist monk who has a history of stoking sentiment against the Rohingya.Since Suu Kyi's government took power last year, 93 people including journalists and activists have been charged or arrested under a controversial law that some worry is used to curb criticism of the authorities, according to advocacy group Research Team for Telecommunications Law.(Reporting by Yimou Lee, Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung; Editing by Nick Macfie)",Rights watchers slam Myanmar's ban on protests in biggest city

Two months ago, he was hauled to court to stand trial for a defamation suit arising from a story he had written on how foreign retirees lost their retirement homes to scammers. He had faced a possible five months in jail. Fortunately, the charges were withdrawn.And so he was free to fly to Manila to cover the 50th anniversary of ASEAN without having to worry about any court suit. Little did he know what awaited him here.I asked Head's permission to post his version of the events of November 13, 2017. This is what he told fellow journos:""I bumped into her by accident. Id gone over to introduce myself to Mocha Uson. When I realized Sass was there I said hello, and introduced myself, because she had commented very critically of my reporting last year. I had hoped to have a constructive conversation. But it wasnt really possible.""  ""Shes obviously smart, and knew what she was doing. It was a skillful ambush. But a bit intense, all the tears, and Mocha Uson handing her tissues. And then the accusation of me, with my white skin misreporting people with brown skin. Hard to argue with really. I did suggest we continue the discussion elsewhere. Of course at an ASEAN press center, without much happening, it attracted a lot of attention. Much better journalists are not the story really. We just arent that important. Our influence is overrated here.""

Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN NewsThere was a collective squeal of kilig when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau strode into the cavernous main briefing room of the International Media Center of the 31st Asean Summit and Related Summits.The almost an hour delay in the press conference only heightened the interest for the charismatic 45-year-old Canadian premier who had girls swooning over him when he came to Manila two years ago for the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation where he was dubbed one of the APEC hotties (the other was Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto).Without much ado, Trudeau started his press conference speaking in both English and French, covering a wide range of issues for both the Filipino and Canadian audience.He took the lingering irritant of the garbage issue head-on even without being asked about it: Canada is engaged to finding a solutionHe said he raised the issues of human rights, the rule of law and extrajudicial killings, which he said Canada is concerned with with President Duterte, who is prickly about human rights and EJKs before the start of the ASEAN-Canada commemorative summit.The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange, he said.He said he also the plight of Rohingya refugees with Myanmars Aung San Suu Kyi, a topic avoided by other leaders.The presscon capped a three-day visit that was a public relations coup  a drop-by in a Jollibee store in Tondo, a visit to Likhaan Womens Center, and a ride in an E-jeepney made by Filipino and Canadian engineers.Clearly, Trudeau outclassed the 20 leaders who attended this years East Asia Summit (EAS), especially U.S. President Donald Trump. To think that Canada is not yet a member the East Asia Summit. He is here as guest of the ASEAN chair, this year being the 40th anniversary of ASEAN-Canada relations.In his opening remarks at the 40th ASEAN-Canada commemorative summit, he said, We will be discussing the accomplishments and potential of a renewed partnership with ASEAN and some new and exciting ways, in which Canada can support this community, including by joining the EAS and the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting Plus.Compare that to Trump who had no public engagements in Manila outside the ASEAN events and even skipped the EAS Summit due to scheduling delays. (Whoever thought of holding mini-concerts in the opening and closing ceremonies should be banned from participating in ASEAN, APEC and other serious events.)Trump left before the start of the AES summit (which was delayed) and delivered his remarks for the event during lunch with the other leaders.***Government officials, especially those from the Presidential Communications Operations Office, commandeered the front row seats in the Trudeau press conference. They were a distracting presence as they were taking selfies, one was even panning with her cellphone, with the Canadian prime minister in the background.We are not complaining about the discriminatory Reserved for VIP signs in official events that we cover. But in a press conference, its a media event and nobody is a VIP except the resource speaker.The officials, whatever their rank, were interlopers in the Trudeau presscon and they should have taken the seats on the sides or at the back.Nakakainis na nakakahiya.***Blog: www.ellentordesillas.comEmail: [email protected]Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: Trudeau owned the Manila East Asia Summit

Before a route is launched, CEB also takes into account airport readiness (such as meeting runway specifications), safety and security processes, and passenger facilities and operations, among others.CEB takes to heart the commitment to nation building and improving the lives of the communities it serves.

You could be in the middle of a much-awaited date with your long-time crush, then suddenly you feel an agonizing pain in your abdomen that's too tough to bear.So, just like a loser, you give in to the pain, and ruin a promising romantic moment.According to a recent survey, almost a quarter of the global population experiences abdominal pain and cramps -- 22% men and 31% women. And it usually occurs during their 20s and early 30s.Two thirds of the people involved in the survey say abdominal pain strikes without warning, while a third say they suffer from agonizing pain every week. It may range from mild and uncomfortable to very severe and unbearable.But what causes abdominal pain?Generally, the organs present inside the abdomen area are very sensitive to both internal and external influences.The food we normally eat goes through our digestive tract; and having allergy or intolerance may cause digestive problems, which can lead to various symptoms such as abdominal pain.In addition, diseases might also cause cramping and irritation in the digestive tract. It is also noteworthy that the abdomen reacts to physical and psychological states and conditions. So anxiety and tension may also trigger abdominal pain.So, what should we do?There are numerous ways to alleviate and eliminate abdominal cramps. Prevention is the best cure, so one should always be wary of the food or beverage that triggers abdominal pain. You may also try to relax to reduce the effects of stress on your digestion.However, when pain strikes, rest assured, there are clinically proven remedies for it.

Imagine spending your whole time taking care of the whole family, worrying what to cook three times a day while ensuring that everyone gets enough cuddles, kisses, and attention.Moms are the most loving, selfless, and understanding people in this world. But you should know that they're also the best mathematician to ever walk on the surface of Earth.Apart from taking care of the whole family, most moms are also in charge of handling finances and budgeting the family's resources. That sounds too much math to handle-- but if you're a money-smart mom, you'd know it's possible.Here are five things money-smart moms have in common:1. You save first before you spend.The moment you receive your salary, you immediately set aside a potion of it for your monthly savings. You have a separate bank account where you deposit your savings, and avoid temptations to spend it.2. You have a household budget.You keep a notebook that contains the breakdown of all expected expenses for the whole month or week. You diligently assign a certain amount for every item, prioritizing food and education before anything else.3. You know the distinction between wants and needs.Wants and needs are like Earth and Mars-- almost similar, but completely different. And you're a money-smart mom if the differences are clear to you, and you know which ones to prioritize.4. You keep an emergency fund.A portion of your monthly budget is dedicated to emergency or contingency fund. You know that life is full of surprises, and you can never be sure what could happen in the next morning. So you make sure there's enough of everything in case winter comes early, unexpectedly.5. You know how to reward yourself and the family without feeling guilty.As a money-smart mom, you know your worth in the family so you don't allow yourself to feel deprived. You set aside money for your hair, skin, and other personal needs. And doing this doesn't make you feel guilty, since you know that at the end of the day, everybody deserves to relax and be pampered.Think you're money-smart? Then you, too, like most moms out there, should use Pine-Sol Multi-Surface Cleaner. This is your all-in-one solution to your various cleaning needs.You can use Pine-Sol cleaners on hard, nonporous surfaces, such as floors, sinks, counters, stoves, bathtubs, shower stalls, and tiles.

Toby Melville, ReutersLONDON - Britain's Queen Elizabeth will add another landmark to her record-breaking reign on Monday when she and Prince Philip celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary.Princess Elizabeth, as she was at the time, married dashing naval officer Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at London's Westminster Abbey on Nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of World War Two, in a lavish ceremony attended by statesmen and royalty from around the world.Seventy years on, Elizabeth, 91, and her 96-year-old husband will mark their platinum anniversary with a small family party at Windsor Castle, the monarch's home to the west of London.A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said there would be no public event to mark the occasion.Greek-born Philip, a descendant of Elizabeth's great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria in his own right, has been at his wife's side throughout her 65-year reign, the longest in British history. He was the person who broke the news to her in 1952 that her father, George VI, had died and that she was now queen.""One of the secrets of this very, very long marriage, and it's an incredibly impressive anniversary, is the fact Prince Philip has always seen it as his main duty to support the queen, to help her in whatever way he can,"" royal historian Hugo Vickers told Reuters.""He is the only person who can actually tell the queen absolutely straight what he thinks, and if he thinks some idea is ridiculous he will say so in whatever language he chooses to use.""The couple first met when they attended the wedding of Prince Philip's cousin, Princess Marina of Greece, to Elizabeth's uncle, the Duke of Kent, in 1934.Philip then gained the attention of his future wife when the then-13-year-old princess made a visit with her parents to Britain's Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in southern England where he was a cadet.""TRULY IN LOVE""""She was truly in love from the very beginning,"" the queen's cousin Margaret Rhodes, a life-long friend and one of her bridesmaids who died last year, wrote in her memoir.Their engagement was announced in July 1947 and they married four months later. With Britain still recovering from the war, the wedding offered a rare burst of color and pageantry against an austere background of rationing and shortages.The 21-year-old princess, who wore an ivory silk Norman Hartnell gown decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, had to collect coupons for her dress like other post-war brides and the couple spent their honeymoon in southern England and Scotland.While some two billion people were estimated to have watched the couple's grandson Prince William marry his wife Kate in 2011, their own wedding was only broadcast live to some 200 million radio listeners, although highlights of the day were captured on grainy black and white film footage.""I can see that you are sublimely happy with Philip which is right, but don't forget us is the wish of your ever loving & devoted Papa,"" King George wrote to his daughter after the wedding.While royal watchers say Elizabeth and Philip have had their ups and downs like any married couple, they have avoided the travails of three of their four children whose marriages have ended in divorce, most notably heir Prince Charles's ill-fated union with his late first wife Princess Diana.It was at the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 1997 that the queen paid a rare personal tribute to her husband.""He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,"" Elizabeth said.No other British monarch has celebrated such a landmark, and indeed Elizabeth was the first to mark a diamond wedding anniversary in 2007.Philip, who has suffered health issues in recent years and was hospitalized in June, retired from active public life in August. They both attended a memorial service on Remembrance Sunday on Nov. 12, although a royal source said the monarch had decided not to lay a wreath so she could watch from a nearby balcony alongside her husband.""Without Prince Philip, the queen would have had a very tough and lonely life. He's been a complete support to her, a rock to her, from the moment she was on the throne,"" royal biographer Claudia Joseph told Reuters.",Going strong: UK's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip celebrate platinum anniversary

Scott Olson, AFPLOS ANGELES - At least 4 people were killed and nearly a dozen people were wounded, including 3 young children, when a shooting broke out Tuesday at a school in rural northern California.Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston told the KCRA news network that the assailant was killed by police following the shooting, which began around 8:00 a.m. at a home in Tehama County and continued at the Rancho Tehama Elementary School.Local news reports said the incident began as a domestic dispute that escalated.Jim Schultz, a reporter for the Redding Record Searchlight newspaper, quoted Rancho Tehama resident Salvador Tello, who was taking his three children to school and described seeing the gunman open fire, killing a woman.""He said he saw bullets strike the truck in front of him and he put his children down to protect them and put his truck to... reverse,"" Schultz said on Twitter.""As he left, he saw (a) woman lying dead in the street and her... wounded husband next to her.

A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of ""ethnic cleansing"".Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar's army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.""We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,"" said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified.The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.""Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,"" the official added.U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.""The secretary will reiterate support for Burma's democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,"" the official added.Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were levelled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.'WHITEWASH'Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used ""excessive force"".The military said that, while 376 ""terrorists"" were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.Human rights groups poured scorn on the military's investigation, branding it a ""whitewash"" and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.""The Burmese militarys absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.Amnesty International also dismissed the military's internal investigation. ""There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,"" the London-based rights group said.The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.And Suu Kyi's failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner's international reputation as a stateswoman.Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar's fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.""Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,"" the U.S. official said.The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.U.N.

File/ReutersPHNOM PENH  With just 10 months to go before Cambodia's next general election, Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for more than three decades, appears to be implementing a shrewd strategy to ensure victory for his Cambodian People's Party.As election gets closer, Hun Sen has been steadily chipping away at the strength of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, the country's only opposition party, whose top leaders are either behind bars at home or in self-exile abroad.At the same time, he has been tirelessly traveling the country to court potential voters from all walks of life, including the country's 700,000-strong garment industry workforce, which was a core support base for the CNRP during the 2013 election.In that election -- the official results of which were disputed by the CNRP -- the opposition party managed to garner nearly half of over 6 million votes cast to win 55 seats in the National Assembly, against 68 for the CPP.Apparently hoping to prevent another close call, Hun Sen has been taking draconian measures against the CNRP ahead of the next election, such as instituting legal action to have it dissolved.Chheang Vanarith, a research associate at the Singapore-based Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, views some of these measures as ""an overreaction to the potential threat posed by the opposition party.""Among them, leading opposition figure Sam Rainsy, who has been living in self-exile since 2015, has been hit with a number of defamation and disinformation court cases, convicted of some, expelled from the National Assembly and stripped of his parliamentary immunity, while he faces arrest if he returns to Cambodia.He resigned as party leader in February after CPP lawmakers moved to amend the Law on Political Parties to dissolve any political party led by someone convicted of a crime.His longtime deputy, party cofounder Kem Sokha, took over the party's leadership earlier this year, only to be thrown into a detention center in September on treason charges.These moves have left the party essentially rudderless at a crucial time, and many CNRP parliamentarians have fled Cambodia for fear of arrest. Those who remain are keeping a low profile.Political observer Lao Mong Hay said Hun Sen has been trying to ""incapacitate CNRP by decapitating it, and destroy it if it can still remain redoubtable rival in the forthcoming election.""According to foreign diplomats, Hun Sen would have faced his toughest election ever if he allowed the CNRP to freely participate.To ensure his party's dominance and his own political survival, they said, he has opted to systematically silence and destabilize the opposition, despite condemnation from some quarters of the international community.From the viewpoint of the CNRP, the pressure being put on Hun Sen so far by Western countries that Cambodia used to depend on for aid has been mild and ineffectual, with the current U.S. administration of President Donald Trump paying scant attention to the country.At the same time, Cambodia has in recent years moved closer and closer to China, its top aid benefactor and investor, and a country that does not preach the virtues of democracy and human rights.According to Chheang Vanarith, Hun Sen ""might have thought the Western countries are declining, particularly the United States and the liberal international order is being challenged by the Sino-centric international order.""""He might view the future world order will center on China. So the Chinese model of governance might be more appropriate for Cambodia,"" he added.For Lao Mong Hay, the international community, especially the United States and the European Union, are ""unwilling to engage forcefully for fear of confronting China, which is actively establishing Chinese hegemony in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia.""Hun Sen's next step is to see the CNRP dissolved by an anticipated court ruling in mid-November, for allegedly conspiring with foreigners to topple his government.He has hinted that after its dissolution, its senior leaders would be banned from politics for five years, similar to action taken in neighboring Thailand against some politicians there.Out of fear for their political future, some CNRP members who won seats in last June's local elections -- in which the CPP won about 3.5 million voter against around 3 million won by the CNRP -- have switched sides to the ruling party.Asked recently if Cambodia will return to one-party rule after the next election, Hun Sen offered assurances that his government is committed to a policy of ""liberal and multi-party democracy.""He insisted that the election will be legally conducted in accordance with the Cambodia's laws and Constitution -- with or without international backing.""It is enough for the legitimacy of the government as long as the election results are recognized by our Cambodian people, and it is not necessary to ask foreign countries to recognize any of our elections,"" he said.Despite criticism from detractors over his strong-arm rule, few would argue that the wily and charismatic leader does not deserve credit for restoring peace and stability to Cambodia, after decades of civil war and a genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge.For his part, Chheang Vanarith acknowledged that Hun Sen, despite some flaws, ""has built the foundation for peace and stability and socio-economic development in this country.""",Cambodia PM Hun Sen maneuvers to win next year's general election

It appeared to work each time.However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user's phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn't easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.""It's not easy for normal people to do what we do here, but it's a concern for people in the security sector and important people like politicians or heads of corporations,"" he said.""(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.""It's the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.""Nothing is 100 percent secure,"" wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note.

Google then remained the default in Europe while regional rivals such as Yahoo, Russia's Yandex and China's Baidu Inc replaced it elsewhere.Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer won a five-year contract with Mozilla in 2014 when Firefox and Google's Chrome browser were battling for users.Chrome's US market share has since doubled to about 60 percent, according to data from analytics provider StatCounter, with Mozilla, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp browsers capturing the rest.Yahoo paid Mozilla $375 million in 2015 and said that it would pay at least the same amount annually through 2019, according to regulatory filings.Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief business and legal officer, said in a statement that the company had ""exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with Yahoo based on a number of factors including doing what's best for our brand, our effort to provide quality web search and the broader content experience for our users.""She continued, ""We believe there are opportunities to work with Oath and Verizon outside of search.""Yahoo and Google aim to recoup placement fees by selling ads alongside search results and collecting valuable user data.

Talking to a bitter character played by JK Simmons, Clooney gently reminds the terminated employee that this guys original dream was to run his own restaurant before such dream was killed by an easy employment that got in the way.I have many friends who were forced into a job because it was the only one available. Once there, they loved the comfort zone. Oftentimes, its hard to give up the money, especially if were supporting a family.But theres a thing called regret.Songwriter Bronnie Ware used to work in the ward for the terminally ill. In many conversations with dying patients, she learned that the biggest regret of people is that they were not able to live the life they had wanted.In the book ""The Miracle Morning,"" bestselling author Hal Elrod mentioned a finding by the Social Security Administration (United States) that after working for 40 years, 95% of people are NOT living the life they had wanted for themselves.I know one way it can happen.After graduating from college, my cousin got me employed as a personnel clerk in a factory making steel barrels and buckets. I was only twenty but the head of personnel already said that I could be his successor. It could have been an easy climb. My office mates were the nicest people in the world. But I knew it wasnt the one for me.As far back as I could remember, I was sure that it was writing and drawing that made me happy. So, on lunch breaks, I walked under the sweltering heat of the sun, feeling my rubber soles burn as I searched for every ad agency in the phone book. I knew that my future was somewhere in those tall towers in the distant Makati horizon. At least 20 of them rejected me but I didnt give up because I was looking for the train stop for the journey of my life.Do you already know what you want to do for the next part of your life?Sir Ken Robinson is an international advisor on education and is probably the most viewed speaker on TED talks. In the book ""The Element,"" Dr. Robinson wrote the element is the meeting point between natural aptitude and personal passion. He also said that when we are in our element, we feel we are doing what we are meant to be doing and who we were meant to be.To know our element, lets answer the question Dr. Robinson wants us to ask ourselves: If left to my own devices if I didnt have to worry about making a living or what others thought of me what am I most drawn to doing?Getting paid for doing what we love is a formula for happiness. But how much do we want to get paid ?A higher-paying job is not necessarily a better job because a sense of fulfillment is greater than money. But if the amount of money we earn is not enough to pay for rent and food, worry will keep us from getting focused. The feeling of being underpaid will eventually take a toll on our self-esteem, too.In the book ""Born For This,"" writer and entrepreneur Chris Guillebeau suggests we find ourselves a job that offers a combination of joy, money and flow. Joy is what we get when we do what we love to do. Money is what enables us to keep doing our job. Flow is about being in the zone that we almost forget the passage of time as we do our best for the work.Then again, many people dont even know what gives them joy.If were young, we can experiment. We can try different jobs until we say this is the one Id like to grow old with. I guess its so much like looking for Mr. or Ms. Right.Mr. Guillebeaus another advice is for us to build our own side business while we keep our day job. For example, I know so many employees who do events planning or magazine writing or t-shirt printing during the weekends. I think this is so much easier to do now that the social media can be a free self-promotion tool. When the side business proves to give us more happiness and the kind of money we want, then it will be time to choose.In the movie ""Up In The Air,"" some of the people they fired were already approaching 60.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Tess is my admin officer who is actually a creative person at heart. I encouraged her to develop her writing skills during the weekend. But she admitted that she devotes the free days to household chores.So, I invited her to imagine a day five years from now. I envisioned she wouldnt congratulate herself for having washed 5,000 clothes or having mowed the lawn 300 times. I suggested that there might be some work she can delegate to someone she can pay so that she can invest her time in her hidden passion. The money you spend you can recover, but time that has passed is gone forever.I have nothing against showing love by doing chores and errands. But we also dont want to grow old regretting all the missed opportunities.My favorite exercise from leadership guru Stephen Covey is the one about time management. The seat work asks us to divide the things that we do into four quadrants:Q1: urgent and important,Q2: important but not urgent,Q3: urgent but not important,Q4: not urgent and not important.*Many people spend most of their time in Q1, urgent and important, and in Q4, not urgent and not important. Examples of things both urgent and important are paying the bills, meeting clients' deadlines, doing what the boss asked us to do, and doing household chores.Watching tv, recreation and keeping social connections are important. But too much media and internet, excessive video gaming and too many nights going out will fall in Q4, not urgent and not important.I tried this exercise among peers last week. My friends discovered they miss out a lot on things that are not urgent but are very important. What are these?Examples are:- quality time with the children,- date with the spouse or partner,- visiting or calling their parents,- routine medical check-ups,- re-connecting with relatives or special friends,- cultivating other talents and skills,- organizing family photos,- reading a book,- travelling,- exercising,- meditative prayer,- serving the community or the church, among others.We also realized many of us dont even find time to rest because we have been programmed to think that rest is unproductive.We fail to give time to these things because they dont have a deadline. We always tell ourselves I will do it one day soon but we can all agree that they always get pushed back by things that have a deadline. One day, we will realize that 20 years have passed and there are many things we can no longer bring back!One person in our group work recognized the fact that some important things we neglect may suddenly become urgent, costly and life-threatening. For example, missed medical check-ups may make us develop a serious illness. Overlooking house maintenance may cause a fire.In a Covey seminar, the instructor advised us to protect our time like we protect our money. This means putting important things first on the planner and asking people to respect our calendar. Our secretary should be our fiercest partner in defending the logbook !Daniel Gilbert is a psychology professor at Harvard. In the book Stumbling on Happiness, he noted that peoples regrets are always of things we didnt have the time, the chance or the courage to do. Yet many of us spend a lot of our time on things we only need to do but dont really want to.We commonly think that failures have been a waste of time. But in Gilberts research, people are less sorry for actions that turned out to be ""mistakes"" but taught them some lesson.In the book ""The Happiness Equation,"" best-selling author Neil Pasricha wrote that one of the secrets of happiness is doing things because we love them, not because of external rewards or what other people think. He proposed the Saturday morning test. He said that what we really love are those that we wish to be doing in the weekend. Think of things that you give you joy and a sense of purpose, so you dont think he suggests spending the whole day in bed.Pasricha observed that people normally procrastinate. If we are given two weeks to accomplish a task, we wait for two weeks before completing the work. So, he recommends setting shorter, self-imposed timelines on the urgent things. For example, if we were given two weeks, lets target to finish in 1 week. Thats how we can create free space for our own interests.David Allen is a professional consultant on time management. In the book ""Making it All Work,"" he advises that the first thing in time management is having a clear picture of our desired future. With this, we can tell what things will get us there and which ones will bring us too far away. He also counsels us to stand firm on our personal values. Its really our values that make us feel good about ourselves. There is no point in achieving our goals if we lose our values in the process.This Holy Week break may be a good time to catch up on our bucket list. Then again, the important things need not wait for those once-a-year opportunities!(*The website MindTools calls this the Eisenhower Principle based on how the former president used to organize his workload.Read Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey and First Things First by Stephen Covey and A.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"I am almost sure that your Facebook feed is filled with messages and memes reminding you to feel good today because nothing is impossible, and you will see it when you believe it because you just have to name it and claim it.Positivity messages have become so widespread. We get it from preachers, New Age writers, motivational speakers, coaches, CEOs, HR experts, psychologists and doctors in a deluge of books, articles, DVDs and YouTube videos.But some authors and experts are not impressed.Award-winning American author and journalist Barbara Ehrenreich wrote this book ""Bright-Sided: How Positive Thinking is Undermining America."" In the book she laments that both spiritual and secular positivity gurus have made Americans believe that if you expect things to get better, they will.Can the mind really attract money?She is not pleased that the book ""The Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne was a runaway bestseller when Byrnes claims on the Law of Attraction are based on wrong interpretations of science. Ehrenreich is not convinced that people can attract to themselves money, things or love just by wishing it to happen.Ms. Ehrenreich noted that American companies paid positivity coaches to make employees focus on the possible rewards instead of bemoaning their low salaries.She reported that coaches were also used to make laid-off employees look forward to new opportunities instead of resenting their former employers.The megachurches were also mentioned by Ehrenreich as institutions that have become like business corporations. She observed that these churches preaching the Positivity Gospel have designed their services and sermons to appeal to the needs of customers -those churchgoers who choose to be reminded of Gods generosity instead of the punishment for sin. She cited pastor Joel Osteen as among those who regularly advised their flock to visualize God prospering their lives.Can the mind cure cancer ?When Ehrenreich was being treated for breast cancer, she was unpleasantly overwhelmed by many think positive messages along with pink ribbons, pink bears, pink mugs and other paraphernalia meant to make her feel good. She felt like a deviant in this community of patients and caregivers. They tried to think happy thoughts of healing when she actually wanted to express anger because, among other reasons, she believed that she got her cancer from a previous medical error.Ehrenreich researched that the death rate in breast cancer is only the same among the positive thinkers and those who had more gloomy thoughts. She also questioned the methodology or premise of some studies connecting positivity to healing.She thinks it is unfair that positivity champions make people think they didnt get healed or didnt become rich because of their own fault they did not have enough faith or they attracted bad luck to themselves.She decries the fact that many positivists deny the existence of real obstacles and real dangers, labelling them as mere excuses to ones success. She preferred that patients were made more alert and aware instead of fully trusting in an imagined guarantee of cure.Has positivity changed lives ?Despite the massive positivity hype, Ehrenreich had reasons to believe that it didnt make America a better and happier place. She cited the fact that anti-depressants are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the US. She also reported that the rich got richer while the share of income going to the bottom 80 percent fell by 7 percentage points from 1979 to 2007. As it turns out, she observed, the promise of abundance was mostly empty for the believers while the gurus flew on their own jets.She thinks that the sub-prime crisis would not have happened if people were more frugal instead of being too confident in using their credit cards and taking out loans.Other books that examine the limitations of positive thinking are ""The Antidote"" by Oliver Burke, ""Rethinking Positive Thinking"" by Gabrielle Oettingen, and ""The Power of Negative Thinking"" by Bob Knight, among others.Whats better than positive thinking ?Ehrenreich clarifies that she doesnt propose negative thinking as an alternative because it can be just as delusional as the positive one. She does not agree to depressed people projecting their misery into the world, imagining worst outcomes from every endeavorInstead, she suggests vigilant realism or defensive pessimism, a term she borrowed from psychologist Julie Norem. It is mostly critical thinking in place of positive thinking. She advises that if we stop looking at things as all-rosy, we will entertain a contrarian point of view no matter how discomforting because the more information we can gather, the better off we are.The threats we face are real and can be vanquished only by shaking off self-absorption and taking action in the world.My own belief on beliefI can agree with Ehrenreich that preachers and gurus have achieved profitable prosperity by telling us what we want to hear.My scientific mind prevents me from believing that the universe is a genie that grants the most ridiculous wishes. I am more ready to accept what other positivity authors have suggested: you cannot expect money to come to you unless you have created anything of value.When I pray, I dont say God, send a million to me. Instead, I thank him for giving me talents that allow me to create things that people pay for. But for now, I keep an open mind. After all, God and the universe are like oceans that cannot fit into our bucket-sized mind. Even Einstein knew only very, very little about them.Why think positive when humans seek negativity?Positive thinking may not solve our problems like a miracle. But I believe it is useful. Our biology needs it.Dr. Loretta Graziano Breuning, founder of the Inner Mammal Institute, wrote the book ""The Science of Positivity: Stop Negative Thought Patterns by Changing Your Brain Chemistry."" She pointed out that the mammal brain, our brain, is wired to constantly scan the environment for threats. Thats a throwback to the caveman era when someone could be killed by a wild animal, falling rocks or a raging river any time. When we feel happy, positive brain chemicals metabolize quickly and we go back to negative mode.Self-preservation was the reason why our negative feelings of fear, anxiety, anger were more intense than positive ones. Those instincts are still with us in these modern times. Our negativity bias, Dr. Breuning asserts, makes us overlook the many good things around us. We deprive ourselves the experience of having a good feeling.So, I think Ehrenreich shouldnt worry that positive thinking will make humans deny the existence of threats and unpleasant things. We are naturally conscious of these realities. For example, even though we received praises from a hundred people, one nasty comment will be enough to ruin our day!I think that a few workshops on positive thinking will enhance our life but not entirely erase our mammal threat-seeking instincts ingrained over many centuries.Psychologist Rick Hanson, in ""Hardwiring Happiness,"" reported that the negativity bias has all of us stressed out during the day. Thats why road rage can be easily provoked. Hanson advised that we should ease the stress by being grateful for happy things that happened during the day.In the book ""The Art of Happiness,"" psychiatrist Howard C. Cutler shared that the Dalai Lamas counsel is for us to replace negative feelings with positive ones. If such Buddhist teaching preceded the positivity fad by many centuries, maybe optimism is truly a human need.I think positivity churches are growing because people are already so frazzled during the whole week, they dont want to be reprimanded on Sunday. I think the positivity mania spread in the corporate world because work is so stressful, we cant tolerate more negativity by officemates. Seeking positivity as a relief is a natural human need in these stressful, unpredictable times.Overcoming Fear and WorryOptimism may not eliminate risks but it can erase our fears and make us enjoy life more. For example, I used to dread flights. Now, I visualize the exciting destinations instead of having morbid thoughts. I trust that no matter how optimistic the pilots and the mechanics are, they will still check anything that may go wrong.We cannot predict events. Being pessimistic can be bad for our health. When we worry, the brain prioritizes supplying resources to the body parts used in fighting. They leave very little for the immune system and the repair of organs.Thats why Jesus asked Can any of you, by worrying, add a single moment to your life span? Likewise, the Buddhist teaching on mindfulness advises against worrying about the future.Hope, Healing and SurvivalIn 1914, twenty-eight sailors were marooned in ice, darkness and hunger for almost two years. Just a few years ago, thirty-three miners were trapped in a mining cave in Chile, hundreds of meters underground for 69 days with almost no food and water. In both cases, all men survived. If they didnt think positive in those obviously hopeless situations, they would have killed one another or gone insane.Eyewitnesses said that Sir Ernest Shackleton, the 1914 expedition leader, did many things to keep his crew distracted by fun, happy thoughts and the hope that they will get through.There is false hope and true hope as admitted by Dr. Jerome Groopman in his book ""The Anatomy of Hope."" He does not believe in giving patients false hopes. He also wouldnt say with certainty that hope is enough for recovery. But he said that belief in the possibility of a cure encourages patients to undergo painful procedures and endure many side effects. I would count this as a case for positive thinking.Dr. Groopman also reported about successful cases in which the placebo effect actually worked. A result of positive expectations.In the book ""The Faith Factor,"" Dr. Dale A. Matthews wrote that over 300 clinical studies demonstrate one simple fact: faith is good medicine.My own months-long battle with insomnia was on its way to depression and claustrophobia. I found the cure in positive thinking advised by both religious people and medical practitioners. (But the details will be for another article.)Bouncing backFor me, one of the most obvious advantages of positivity is its ability to help us rise from defeat or sadness.I will not impose my cheerfulness on people who are grieving. I will not underestimate their pain. I will not ask them to look at the bright side if they wish to express anger. But when they are ready to start again, I hope that they will feel optimistic that life can still be great. Finding new zest for life is the common story by people who go from trial to triumph.I dont blame motivation coaches for pushing people, those who have failed and those who have been laid off, to the limits of their potential. Some may not become as great as how they visualize themselves to be, but they may reach higher levels of competence.Success may not be for all. Just like not anyone who goes to college becomes an accomplished professional. Some will fail. But I think that no human being must be deprived of the encouragement to dream and to rise from failure.We need positivity to mend our broken spirits and to embolden our anxious hearts.Dr. Breuning wrote that Our quality of life rests on inventions made by people who were often disappointed during their livesBut they kept taking steps anyway. If humans only did things that got short-run rewards, we would have worms in our intestines and war with our neighbors and die by age thirty. Instead, we have comfortable lives because people who came before us went beyond disappointment.Have a great day ! Just being optimistic.----------If you have concerns about your job or if you wish to suggest a topic, you may email me at [email protected]Read more about ExecuTips on www.robertlabayen.comAbout the Author:Robert Labayen spent 22 years in advertising prior to joining ABS-CBN in 2004.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Editor's note: This an expanded version of a statement that Ambassador Teddy Locsin, Jr. delivered at the United Nations.We agree with the Secretary-General: the rule of law at the national and international levels is not only critical, but essential in building and keeping the peace, to prevent conflict, and thereby sustain the most congenial climate for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.At the national level, the rule of law is an instrument of justice and the precondition of inclusive development. A slave economy, such as colonialism, is an economic development but exclusively for the benefit of the masters. This is not our idea of development though expansionist powers think they are doing a favor to the countries whose territory they covet. Injustice is a development no one welcomes. A case in point is territory seized by paramilitaries sponsored by a neighboring power on the claim it racially belongs to it and yet it will not accord the population of the reacquired territory either its citizenship or respect for its human rights.The UN plays a key role in encouraging the rule of law by supporting capacity building and the exchange of best practices at the national level. The report documents key examples in developing countries.On the other hand, international law is the great equalizer among States, giving voice to all nations with equal resonanceregardless of political, economic and military size. Singapore, a great justice of the Philippine Supreme Court told me, is an example of a great country whose diminutive size makes it entirely dependent on international law for its existence.Anchored in the multilateral treaty system, international law seeks to bind the community of nations and prevent anarchy in the global orderwithout subjugation and submission which create order but not the kind we have in mind. This is the idea behind spheres of influence, such as a new one sought to be established in Asia to the exclusion of the United States which is the sole guarantor of stability, peace and national sovereignty in the region.The vision of the UN Charter remains as relevant as it is eloquent since the conclusion of the San Francisco conference in 1945, where the Philippines was presentthat is, these united nations are the best achievement, and the best hope, for the rule of law at the international level.In previous years, we shared each others comprehensive legal framework on access to justice for all including for the poorest and most vulnerable, and our best national practices in the implementation of multilateral treaties. This year, we are brainstorming the ways and means to further disseminate international law to strengthen the rule of law.Before proceeding further, let one must recall our landmark Declaration on the Rule of Law on both levels which we adopted five years ago. The Declaration recognizes that across the UN system, we have institutions, working methods and relationships to make the rule of law relevant to peace and security, human rights and development.We reaffirm our support for the Declaration. It contains priority elements, ranging from the peaceful settlement of disputes to the role of international tribunals, from anti-terrorism to anti-corruption priorities, from sovereign equality to gender equality.The 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes is the authoritative articulation of our collective duty under the UN Charter to peacefully resolve disputes. The goodwill of emerging powers is nothing to that declaration.The Declaration highlights stronger international cooperation to dismantle illicit networks, and counter the world drug problem, as well as suppress transnational organized crimeincluding money-laundering, trafficking in persons, trafficking in arms and other forms of organized crimeall of which threaten human rights, the security of societies and nations, and undermine sustainable development by flouting the rule of law.International law is equally essential to the rule of law at the national level. One protects the other, even as the other informs the first to make it practical. How, then, can we further disseminate international law to strengthen the rule of law over all?At the national level, international law is important for norm and standard-setting, access to and delivery of justice, and the protection of human rights which are threatened as much by aggression from abroad as by oppression and organized crime at home. Any refusal to recognize the latter threat can only be explained by the inclusion on the payroll of the drug and human trafficking cartelsor a breathless naivet.International law confers universality to national law and makes it intellectually and morally compelling. In the same way, national law pulls international law down to reality so it is effective and meaningful.The culture of the rule of law should be encouraged at the formative stage so it is internalized. Law abidingness is not a basic instinct; it is lawlessness that is that. Law abidingness is an acquired taste. Schoolchildren should be introduced to the Convention on the Rights of the Child as much as revulsion to Oriental despotism however generous its promises of largesse tend to be.This moral formation should continue throughout the educational system with increasingly complex subjects that impressionable students could relate with, like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the rights of marginalized sectors, and international humanitarian law. It would help if those who enabled the worst human rights violations in the past 30 years would not denounce alleged violations from the podium, as that tends to discredit human rights.Law schools should offer more specialized subjects of international law, like Law of the Sea, international criminal law and trade law. Academe, law firms and government should support regional cooperation on international law, including the UN regional courses on international law.There is also great potential at the international level. For one, delegations to UNCITRAL meetings should consider including private lawyers in their national delegations. It will enlarge their repertoire of legal techniques and enrich domestic jurisprudence.We must encourage the establishment of international law societies among academics and non-academics alike, whether or not they are lawyers. Capacity building in international law is also key. Exchanges of experience and best practices among judges and police and security officials in the law of counterterrorism has had practical benefits.Finally, the UN should spotlight one key multilateral treaty at each UN high level week, and establish as a tradition, a signing ceremony like the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which was adopted by a breathing majority of UN member states and the Paris Agreement.We thank other delegations for their contributions to this debate, and we eagerly await their suggestions on moving forward. We hope to enhance greater coordination among UN entities in parlaying the rule of law to support the three pillars of the UN and the 2030 Agenda. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: The rule of law and development
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Editor's note: Ambassador Teddy Locsin, Jr. delivered the following Philippine statement at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 30, 2017 on the Report of the International Criminal Court (01 August 2015  31 July 2016).Mr. President, your excellencies, colleagues:We thank President Silvia Fernndez de Gurmendi for her comprehensive report.As a real democracy, and a multi-ethnic Christian majority and Muslim minority society which cherishes diversity in all aspectsin the spirit of religious and political tolerance which has marked both religions at their bestand whose core values are American, the Philippines once again reaffirms its commitment to justice and to fighting intolerance and impunity, ensuring that perpetrators account for their crimes. The Philippines remains strongly committed to upholding the rule of law and human rights.The legacy of Nuremburg is that individuals can be made accountable even if their acts were not statutory crimes, and governments tolerated them or even sanctioned them. ""Crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced."" A reaffirmation of mans free will for good and evil.Without Nuremburg, we have little hope and commitment of saving ourselves and our children from the scourge of war, which twice in our founding fathers and mothers lifetimes brought untold sorrow to all humanity. Without Nuremberg, justice could not have coped with the limitless ingenuity of evil men in perpetrating acts that defied the imagination of lawmakers until they saw with horror those acts done from the Rape of Nanking to Auschwitz, from the killing fields of Biafra and Cambodia to Bosnia and Rwanda, from the blood bath that created Bangladesh to the torture centers of the Caliphate.People, individually, then collectively, make justice work. In the same way, they commit injustices on a vast scale. There have been many heroesfrom Nuremburg to the creation of the International Criminal Court, the adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998, and the election of its first bench of judges in 2003. These heroestoo many to name but not enough to have prevented the outrages they prosecuted and judgedrange from lawyers and civil society advocates, to witnesses and the victims.Mr. President, no one is above the law. The Philippines joins previous speakers in upholding and defending the Rome Statute. To be sure, despite the creation of the Court, one thing has not changedthe collective work of delivering international justice remains a vocation that is difficult, thankless and even dangerous.Challenges remain. One is universality. The Philippines joins the call for many more countries to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute. Yet, whether or not we are States Parties, we should all protect human rights and build domestic capacities to enforce them and punish their violation.The Philippines again calls on the Security Council P5 to refrain from using their veto in situations patently involving mass atrocity crimes, and to take the necessary follow-up measures in situations referred to the Court so as to uphold the credibility of both institutions.In the same spirit of genuine understanding, and ahead of the 16th Assembly of States Parties in December, the Philippines also supports full and candid dialogue and consultations to address allegations of inequality and unfairness in the work of the Court. Judges are only human, as the High Commissioner on Human Rights so eloquently put it. Nonetheless, the work these judges do far, far outweighs the flaws of individuals that discredit the Courts noble mission: to wit, justice where none would otherwise be possible; the protection of the weak that none of the strong will protect; and the vindication of their rights which have been trampled.In this context, let me briefly refer to Philippine campaign against illegal drugs which pose an existential threat to our country. We were advised to tolerate a worsening drug situation; urged to live with the threat it poses by avoiding strong measures to defeat it; and to legalize drugs so as to make addiction a benign condition. But legalizing such a crime does not make it less so.We refuse to do that.We cannot live with what will not let our people live in peace and well-being, in freedom and national security. Ever in the mind of every country in Asia is the subjugation of a great empire [China] by two others [UK and Imperial Japan] flooding it with opium.We remain resolute in combatting the proliferation of drugs and the prevalence of drug addiction in our country. A whole-of-nation approach is needed to solve this problem. And vigorous law enforcement is definitely part of it. As many of you now know, and the UN alerted us, there is an intimate and indisputable relationship between terrorism and the illegal drug trade. The siege of Marawi and what was found there proves it conclusively.Let me repeat basic principles. The Philippines is committed to upholding the rule of law and respecting human rights in the fight against illegal drugs. We do not condone killings.It is tragic that many deaths resulted outside of lawful police operations. They are being investigated and prosecuted in the Philippines criminal justice system, as many of them were found to be rub-outs committed by unknown groups perhaps taking advantage of the governments campaign.Accountability in the campaign is of overriding concern to the President; he has ordered the internal cleansing of the entire police organization, relieved a major command, and taken the campaign away from the national police to a specialized drug enforcement agency with a long record of cooperation with its counterparts in the US and Europe. Government critics now object that the agency is too small to cope with the drug problem. It is either too much or too little. You cannot please everybody.As a State Party to the Rome Statute, the Philippines will cooperate to provide true information, and has invited the UN to do so, with the exception of politicized individuals with a personal stake in proving themselves right regardless.Mr President, the Court is a court of last resort. The Philippines has a responsibility and a right itself to prosecute crimes under the Rome Statute. We have a functioning criminal justice system able to prosecute these crimes. In the spirt of the laws, let us both show that complementarity works, and that biased intervention even if merely vocal is not necessary.Thank you for your attention.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: We do not condone killings
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"A view of Philippine occupied (Pagasa) Thitu island in disputed South China Sea. ReutersMANILA - A foreign affairs analyst believes Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana's visit to the Pag-asa Island signals a stronger position of the Philippines on the disputed seas.Professor Richard Heydarian said Lorenzana's visit to the island located in disputed South China Sea is a ""major, major shift"" in the administration's moves regarding the matter.This is the reason, said Heydarian, why China was ""gravely concerned"" and ""dissatisfied"" with the incident, prompting it to issue a statement.""Now, we suddenly have the Duterte administration trying to draw the line in the sand and sending clearer signal to the Chinese that we're going to stand our ground,"" he told ANC on Monday.Heydarian said Lorenzana's visit to Pag-asa Island shows that resistance is an option for the Philippines when it comes to the disputed seas.He believes the Duterte administration should also make it clear that despite pledges of investments, the Philippines is standing its ground on its claims and is not giving concessions to China on the matter.""I think it's very important for the Duterte administration to make it clear that improvement of bilateral relations is by no means tantamount to the Philippines just giving up on its claims and relaxing its position on sensitive territorial and maritime issues.,"" he said.The Philippines and China are set to hold bilateral talks on the dispute in May.",'Pag-asa Island visit shows stronger PH position on sea disputes'
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Here and abroad, the common (mis)perception is that the current government is too cozy with China and, correspondingly, relaxing its claims in the West Philippine Sea. After all, you have a chief executive, who never fails to praise Beijing as a friendly, brotherly nation, which could serve as an indispensable partner for national development in the Philippines, while nonchalantly downplaying the bilateral maritime disputes as a seemingly peripheral concern.Thank you for loving us and helping us survive the rigors of this life, declared Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte earlier this year after China extended a generous aid package for disaster-relief and agricultural development. I made the correct decision [to improve ties with China]. I went alone [on] foreign policy then I went to China and talked to President Xi Jinping [last October].Under his command, the Philippines has effectively set aside its landmark arbitration case, sought to pursue an 'independent' foreign policy, which ""will not be dependent on the United States"", and, indeed, scaled back major joint military exercises with Washington, namely the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training Exercise (Carat) and U.S.-Philippine Amphibious Landing Exercise (PHIBLEX).Plans for joint patrols in the South China Sea have been cancelled, while Americans have been barred from utilizing Philippine bases for conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea. They have also been barred from developing facilities in the Bautista Airbase in Palawan, close to Kalayann Islands, under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Not to mention the occasional cusses against Western leaders.Upon closer look, however, it is clear that the Duterte administration is in fact engaging in a classic 'hedging strategy', reaching out to China, but also maintaining robust cooperation with America. All our defense treaties and vast majority of our joint exercises with America have remained intact, one must note.Hedging is a constantly evolving strategy, a relentless pursuit for the goldilocks level of engagement and deterrence vis--vis rivals. Often, it is natural for some governments, or elements within, to emphasize engagement over deterrence or vice-versa. This is, as I have argued, the ongoing dynamics within the Duterte administration, which most observers miss.This was particularly true in recent months, whereby Duterte emphasizes engagement with China, while defense officials remind us of suspicious Chinese activates in the Benham Rise or the Scarborough Shoal.Moreover, the current government is actually doing something that the previous administration/s have shunned: Tangibly strengthening our position on the ground beyond legal debates and abstract strategic discourse. This commendable and indispensable effort is led by no less than Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, one of the most decorated soldiers in Philippine history.While Duterte hobnobs with Chinese leaders, hoping to revive bilateral investment ties, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), led by Lorenzana, is trying to refurbish and upgrade our civilian and military facilities in Pag-Asa and other land features under our control in the Spratlys.As Commander of the Light Armored Brigade and member of the Presidential Security Group, Lorenzana directly protected the lives of three presidents. As a diplomatic attach for Veterans Affairs in America, he successfully secured $265-M for surviving World War II veterans in the Philippines. Now, as the defense secretary, he is trying to protect the Philippines fragile position in the West Philippine Sea in spite of Dutertes outreach to the Asian juggernaut.And he is walking the talk. Last week, we woke up to a pleasant news: Lorenzana and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff General Eduardo Ao, accompanied by other patriotic men in uniform, visited Pag-Asa, where they inspected facilities, showed moral support to our personnel and civilians there, and oversaw plans for strengthening our position on the ground.After years of neglecting our facilities on the ground, we are once again focusing on fortifying the countrys de facto (not only de jure) position on the ground. On the way to Pag-Asa, their plane was harassed by a nearby Chinese military detachment, but they stood their ground and reiterated that they were indeed in Philippine airspace, not Chinas The message was clear: What is ours is ours! That Surrender and appeasement isnt an option, and that resistance doesnt man war. In fact, this is precisely what other small claimant countries such as Vietnam and Taiwan have been doing for decades.What particularly caught my attention was a video clip, which shows Lorenzana, Ao, and other men in uniform standing firm and proud before a flickering Philippine flag, which danced to the sky under the scorching sun hovering above Pag-Asa. You could see in their faces the burning conviction and the unshakable courage that guides these men -- and the willingness to sacrifice their lives for the motherland, if necessary.And it is precisely men like Lorenzana, Ao, and countless brave soldiers in the AFP, along with those in the Philippine Coast Guard and all key agencies of the government, who continue to give us hope that the country will stand its ground, even against better-equipped and determined maritime rivals.",OPINION: Lorenzana and the true Patriots
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"The volume of reportage on the travails encountered by the efforts to retrieve the Bells of Balangiga has become inevitably a sequel to the history itself of that bloody encounter of a September morning in 1901.We speak of an episode in the Philippine-American War at the turn of the last century. The Bells were from the belfry overlooking the church plaza of that quiet little town in the southern coastal tip of Samar island in the Philippines, Balangiga.The bells were said to have been tolled as participating witnesses to what was once referred to as a Massacre. Thus, the Bells were carted off to the US as war booty in disregard of its ecclesiastical provenance.Two Balangiga bells on display at F.E. Warren Air Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Courtesy of Dennis WrightFor many decades, negligently warehoused until thought to be an utile trophy dcor, the Bells were installed in a park space inside a Wyoming Air Base. As a critical nuance to the repossession controversy, the bells were never a part of any recorded or authorized war memorial as US law requires.Its hoped-for eventual return has been pending since the mid-1990s, entangled in a morass of local and federal politics, misguided sentiments, misinterpreted history and, of course, bureaucracy. The matter is now pending disposition somewhere in Washington DC.The cast of individuals of conscience and sincere concern who have championed the cause of the Bells return has lengthened. By simply coming to know of the Bells circumstances, many individuals in the United States, Americans and Fil-Ams, have expressed their affinity with a cause they found to be most worthy and meritorious. Some have been active staunchly lobbying within their respective circles of influence. I believe it is an on-going labor of love.Until some 30 years or so ago, the Philippine Government did not really have any official cognizance of the matter. There was, however, a claim by two Honolulu, Hawaii-based individuals of having approached and written the Philippine Government about the presence of these Bells at the F.E.Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, made during the Marcos era. Their entreaties were never answered. But they persisted, undiscouraged, and acted anew.On May 8, 1987, a Mr. John Witeck (who I came to know as a University of Hawaii graduate in Asian Studies, a social activist and a staff member of the United Public Workers) wrote to me at the Philippine Consulate in Honolulu. I had been serving then as the Consul General for a little over a year. He said: A good friend... Mr. Walter Kundisinformed me that some years ago he discovered the presence of.church bells stored on the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He went on to share some historical information on the Bells along with his sentiments saying: they should be returned to the people of the Philippines. Until then, I knew nothing of the Bells, much less its location. Neither did anyone in government nor in academia.He ended his letter: Please let us know if you or your government are interested in the return of these bells.. He offered contact with Mr. Kundis, a union member and steward, a WW II veteran, for additional information. Mr. Witeck also indicated that he will address Hawaii Senator Spark Matsunaga requesting his assistance in arranging the return of the bells to the people of the Philippines.In his May 22 letter to Sen. Matsunaga, Mr. Witeck wrote: Please assist us in the project of returning church and mission bells to the Philippine churches and people. Sen. Matsunaga did, in fact, write the Department of the Air Force and provided Mr. Witeck a copy of the reply. Sen. Matsunaga noted that ...the US Air Force is not willing to release them at this time. The Consulate was provided a copy of the Air Force reply.Obviously, Warren Air Base top brass had already been alerted about a Philippine intent to officially claim the Bells. The Air Forces response may also have been the basis for objections coming from local politicians and members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.It would have been highly irresponsible for the Consulate General not to have acted positively on this opportunity for a very significant historical restoration provided by Mr. John Witeck. It was 1987, then, when with quiet little steps, the retrieval mission was commenced.It was not until March of 1989, however, when the Subject: Bells of Balangiga was officially reported to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, as a Consulate General initiative, reporting the Consular level progress thus far, utilizing contacts with the Pacific Air Force and the Commander-in-Chief through Foreign Policy Advisor, Dr. John D. Finney, Jr. All documentation was provided our Foreign Affairs department.When President Cory Aquino recalled me back to the country to join the Cabinet as her Press Secretary in January 1, 1990, the Bells was off my hands. I was however much elated when then Secretary of National Defense Fidel V. Ramos took up the matter privately with then US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who came late in March for consultative meetings. Sec. Ramos provided Sec. Cheney copies of all my Bells documentation and communications.When Fidel V. Ramos became President, with Raul Rabe as the Philippine Ambassador to Washington DC, the real big game of diplomatic pursuit for the Bells was in full throttle. Ambassador Rabe was the point man who almost singlehandedly marshalled his resources to achieve the recovery. Unfortunately, his best of efforts and intentions were stalled by local Wyoming politics, bureaucracy and perhaps a misinterpretation of historical ties between America and the Philippines.Hope is steadfast that America will be America, in fairness and in generosity, as she has done with other war mementos, relics and souvenirs under similar circumstances in other earlier occasions.Whatever the outcome, I should not fail to remember and recognize that two caring American friends, John Witeck and Walter Kundis (wherever they are, I wish them well), generated and made possible this historical vignette.N.B. I must not, likewise, be remiss in recommending that for history buffs and aficionados, the literature on the subject of the Balangiga affair is best read through the published works of Dr. Rolando O. Borrinaga and Mr. Bob Couttie. (The Balangiga Conflict Revisited and Hang the Dogs The True Tragic History of the Balangiga Massacre, respectively. Both by New Day Publishers). These two books are outstanding and indispensable, quite apart from the pending return of the Bells of Balangiga.",OPINION: Bells of Balangiga: Antecedents to the retrieval
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"There is apt and well-positioned bragging rights, historically documented, over the fact that Filipinos were first to land in America. Since 1587, the clarion claims. Pointedly emphasizing that the event preceded the 1607 English settlement in Jamestown. That was the first English permanent settlement in North America, thereafter becoming the United States of America.To be precise about it, that landing was not and never a settlement. Nonetheless, there is absolutely a proud ring to it. We were here first! Shorn of any profundity, it is easily, simply a delayed reaction to years of discrimination, abuse and degradation suffered by the earliest of post-Philippine-American War labor immigration to the United States. Positively No Filipinos Allowed still lingers as a painful memory.This is an important aspect of the current observance in all of the United States of the Filipino American History Month (FAHM) as sanctioned by an act of the US Congress. By the way, it is History and not Heritage  a correction that is repeated yearly.The historical documentation based on that 1587 voyages log book says that eight Filipinos identified as Yndios Luzones (yet to be known as Filipinos) were with the landing party headed by Pedro de Unamuno, having sojourned for some three days in a Central California Coast point close to todays San Luis Obispo in Morro Bay. October 18-20. An accidental stop-over, not a destination. The destination was Acapulco, arriving there in November 22, 1587.Courtesy of Filipino American National Historical SocietyA marker/shrine was dedicated in 1995 on a promontory overlooking Morro Bay under the auspices of the Filipino American National Historical Society (FANHS), the moving spirit behind the annual national observance of Filipino American History Month.In 1587, obviously, there was no USA, yet. Remember 1776? Neither were there Filipinos. Must we also point out that Christopher Columbus never really set foot on Continental American soil? Neither North nor South. His voyages, under royal Spanish patronage, landed only in islands of the Caribbean and West Indies. Until his death, Columbus was of the belief that he had reached the Orient! Have you ever wondered why she is America and not Columbiana or some such derivation?In 1587, there was, however, already a Las Islas Filipinas. Named after King Phillip II of Spain, courtesy of Ruy Lopez de Villalobos who recorded Felipinas to mean Samar and Leyte in 1543. Heretofore, we were San Lazaro an appellation given by Magellan. The inhabitants, our forefathers, were called Indios by the Spaniards.Now, here is a quick look at chronological encyclopedic history. The term America began to be used, not yet quite universally though, in the early 16th century. That is just about before Magellan enjoyed Waray-waray hospitality in Homonhon (1521). This was quite sometime after the Columbus voyages (1492). Here is another fact which is not quite so trivia. German cartographer (mapmaker) Martin Waldseemuller is credited with the first use of America, latinized after Amerigo Vespucci, a post-Columbus explorer who proved that the West Indies were not in the Orient.Now, here is the tweak. To be indisputably precise, the very first indios de Felipinas to land in Continental North America were not the ones of the Unamuno voyage of 1587. Neither was it in Coastal California that they first touched in North America. And, furthermore, the Yndios were not from Luzon.The very first indios de Felipinas to land and settle in Continental North America arrived on board the galleon San Pedro in the port of Acapulco in Nueva Espana (Mexico in early 19th century), October 8, 1565!A prime mandate received by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi from the crown of Spain was to find and establish the return route (tornaviaje) to Acapulco. In compliance, therefore, Legazpi dispatched Andres de Urdaneta (as navigator-in-charge) on board the galleon San Pedro, piloted by Rodrigo de Espinosa and captained by Legazpis grandson, Felipe de Salcedo. Friday morning the first of June 1565. The galleon San Pedro departed the port of Zubu (Cebu) We arrived to this Port of Acapulco on Monday the eight of October 1565.For this information, we are in debt to the Historical Society of Southern California for the English translation of the San Pedros logbook written by Rodrigo de Espinosa, as conserved in the Archivos de Indias in Sevilla, Spain. ( The Log of the San Pedro, The First China Ship, 1565)Let me quote from the most relevant and salient portion for purposes of our discourse. The Indians..serving as sailors that we have onboard this galleon, that is going to New Spain, say that there is a passage through there that goes to Tandaya. (The translators of this document concluded that the native sailors were obviously Visayans, coming from Cebu as they did. What followed was a description of the route. Tandaya is an ancient name for lower Samar (vs. the upper half which is Ybabao) Following the description of the route towards the Pacific Ocean, the translators have also analyzed and identified the islands along the way to be Gigatangan, Maripipi, Tagapula, Dalupiri and Capul.)The tornaviaje event we speak of is in fact the successful inaugural of the Galleon Trade (also referred as Nao de China by some historians.) The Manila-Acapulco trade route was to serve international commerce for the next 250 years! It is the first tornaviaje that brought the first indios de Felipinas to Continental North America. The year was 1565. Not 1587. Until after Manila was settled in 1571, there were still several more voyages that traversed the Pacific with Cebu as the point of embarkation. In other words, to coin a phrase, the seamen were Indios Visayanos.The most authoritative and indispensable dissertation on the Galleon Trade is a 1939 opus by William Lytle Schurz titled The Manila Galleon, backed by a very impressive 29-page bibliography. The book is the go to English source for scholars undertaking research. According to Schurz, the return voyages had always relied on the services of native sailors ever since. And hardly did they return to Felipinas, unequivocally meaning that Indios de Felipinas remained to settle in Nueva Espana.Here are some more citations from Schurz. ..the galleon was often left at Acapulco without a return crew for the return trip to Manila. (p. 211, 1959 reprint / E.P. Dutton & Co. Inc. New York)The earlier galleons carried a crew of from sixty to one hundred, according to the size of the ship or the supply of seamen available.( p.209 ) By 1724, hardly a third were said to be of Spanish birth.(p.210), meaning the Galleon crew were mostly natives of Islas Filipinas.And, in 1618 the Espiritu Santo (galleon) lost seventy-four of the seventy-five native seamen, who were hired by Mexican Indians to teach their tribe the manufacture of palm wine. (p. 211) Tuba, the Visayan coconut palm wine, had become our first exported transfer of technology!One last thing about The Manila Galleon. There is an unfortunate fly in the celebrated ointment of this history, evincing that scholars do commit mistakes. Schurz misidentified the Galleon of the first trans-Pacific return route. In his book, he referred to the ship as San Pablo, an error that was perpetrated many times by many a historian relying solely upon Schurz. There was indeed a San Pablo in the Legazpi fleet but the ship remained in Cebu, to sail at some future date.It was the galleon San Pedro that was commissioned to carry the first Filipino immigrants to America! 1565 A.D.(Disclosure: I am not an academically credentialed historian.

In Myanmar and Thailand, draconian laws have led to the arrests of journalists, the group added.""We are calling on the ASEAN heads of state to uphold media freedom and stop the attacks on our colleagues. These are not random acts of violence. They are more often than not political persecution, Ivarsson said.Most vulnerableSince the ouster of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, 178 journalists have died in the Philippines, 12 of them women.Ivarson pointed out that five journalists have died since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed power in 2016.Saady said local journalists and citizen journalists are especially vulnerable to attacks.The conflicts and wars happen in their hometowns, involving people they might know, she said.Saady said a second installment of the guidebook could focus on Philippine cases and best practices by journalist organizations.UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova has pointed out that female journalists face a double attack violence as they are targeted as women and as a professional journalists.DemonizedInternational Association of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) members hold hands at the launch of a safety handbook for women journalists in war and conflict, in Manila on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Thousands of Filipinos spent Sunday, November 5, at the Edsa Shrine and later, the People Power Monument.The twin events, a Mass called by Lingayen Archbishop Socrates Villegas, and a prayer rally cum cultural program by Tindig Pilipinas, shared a call: ""Stop the Killings, Start the Healing.""Everyone knows the context of ""Stop the Killings.""Various human rights groups have protested the 12,000 killings since President Rodrigo Duterte came to power last year. Most of these have to do with the crackdown on narcotics that he promised during the 2016 presidential campaign.The police say official operations led to nearly 4,000 killings.Almost twice as many are lumped under the innocuous label, ""deaths under investigation,"" which government blames on so-called vigilante groups or turf wars between rival drug gangs. Rights groups say evidence and eyewitness accounts indicate cops or their proxies are also behind these murders.The aftermath of the Sunday gatherings consisted largely of bickering over the number of participants.The police said 5,000 people attended the mass, the march and prayer rally. Tindig Pilipinas claimed 20,000 people joined the peaceful, non-political protest.SilencedAmid the interviews and statements and social media flame wars, we missed the most crucial points.Where were the direct victims of Duterte's bloody campaign, the survivors and the families of the slain?Why weren't they on stage at the rally or given a part in Villegas' mass?The families of Duterte's victims were there. The separate delegations of Baigani and Rise Up for Life and Rights included children, wives, mothers and fathers who have talked to journalists or in smaller gatherings.Both groups tried their best to coordinate with church leaders and Tindig to give the families of EJK victims space and time.But the families were shoved to the margins by both clergy and politicians. They barely got into the mass. Hours after, they were left to huddle among themselves and a few sympathetic souls, away from the lit up stage where songs and other art forms aimed to tell their stories.Why?They are articulate, these women and men, girls and boys who fight for justice against all odds. They write poetry to lost sons and songs to fathers they will never see again. They can narrate, minute by minute, the nightmares that claimed the lives of their kin and friends.They speak in the cadence of truth: the rhythms of running feet and shouts and the thuds of bullets, the screams that rent their nights and days, and the lamentation that followed the killings.The Nov. 5 organizers deprived them of the opportunity to speak on what had been drummed up as an important event.Journalists, of course, have long tracked down these families and reported on their plight. But here were thousands of people coming together on their behalf. One assumes they also came to listen to the truth first-hand.Fear and worldviewThere is nothing wrong with speaking up for others. But there is no greater display of solidarity than stepping aside and ceding the platform to the otherwise voiceless.Church leaders and politicians have access to media and the public any time they want. You cant bill an event as a call to stop the killings and ignore representatives of the slain.Between Villegas, with access to at least all the media platforms of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), and the mother, daughter or wife of a man slain while begging for his life, who should have taken precedence?Hardest to understand was the absence of the EJK families on Tindigs stage. Granting it was a cultural program, they couldnt even find Nanay Normita, the mother with an elegy to her son?Perhaps the heart of the problem can be found in the fervent reassurances that the event was not political, that the organizers had no intention of disturbing the peace, that they were not part of any destabilization plot.You dont respond to a tyrant with these reassurances. You assert the right to protest in the face of his abuses.It makes people wonder about motives and worldview.How can Stop The Killings be anything than political? How do you discuss the killings without tackling the infrastructure of injustice?How can a wifes rage not be political when the killers are cops? How can a mothers lament not be political when her innocent son dies in a campaign that purports to save Filipino children?Or, maybe, the problem lies with people seeing the EJK families as recipients of charity, rather than people already empowered by the experience of tragedy, with the right to organize and protest.It is easy to embrace people as our wards, harder to grant them the rights and privileges we take for granted.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",BLOG: Left out in the cold

But EJKs include killings that are not investigated by the state when it is mandated to do so.Probe killingsThe Philippine National Police (PNP) claimed last month that the country has zero EJKs.The agency on October 9 said it has records of 6,225 drug-related killings from July 1, 2016 to August 29, 2017.Of these, 3,811 deaths were due to police operations and 2,290 lumped under deaths under investigation, a category that includes so-called vigilante killings or rubouts during gang turf wars.The PNP is mandated by law to investigate all deaths that occur during official operations.Yet only 71 of 6,225 cases  little more than one percent  have resulted to charges filed before the Justice Department as of September 2017.Of these, 45 involved police operations. Only 19 cases have been filed in court, mostly by rights activists and private legal groups.The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) requested in September a review of cases of killings during police operations.The request was turned down by Undersecretary Catalino Cuy, officer-in-charge of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), which oversees the PNP.""Once it's collated, we have to get clearance from the President,"" Cuy said, citing Dutertes insistence that no police officer or soldier can be investigated for alleged human rights violations without his permission.Clear definitionThe President and law enforcement officials have accused rogue cops in the pay of drug gangs and destabilizers of sabotaging his campaign.Thats deliberate, Duterte said on September 8, referring to a series of cop killings of youth.Silipin mong mabuti kasisinasabotahe kayo, he ordered PNP Director-General Ronald de la Rosa.(Look closely into these cases; they look like sabotage.)Two weeks ago, Duterte reiterated, there are no EJKs here.We don't even know how to define EJK, the President said. Other countries can't force their definition because we are sovereign nation.Edre Olalia, executive director of the National Union of Peoples Lawyers (NUPL) and a Manlaban convenor, said killings perpetrated by state agents outside the legal and judicial process should be considered EJKs or summary executions.Government officials like to claim that there are no extra-judicial killings since there is no judicial killing due to the absence of the death penalty.That just means these killings are all extra-judicial, except in cases where there is clear proof of suspects fighting it out, Olalia said.The NUPL and other legal groups, he pointed out, have already filed murder cases against police officers after witnesses came out to dispute their nanlaban (resisting arrest) claim.He also cited the case of minor Kian de los Santos slain by Caloocan cops. Police initially claimed the 17-year-old had tried to shoot at arresting officers.Witnesses, however, said cops dragged an unarmed youth through alleys before shooting him, a claim backed up by barangay video footage and forensic experts.The crucial factor is whether a person was killed without being given due process, Olalia stressed.In Kians case, police have admitted they had no reports of the minor's involvement in drugs prior to their operation.InducementOlalia and another Manlaban convenor, former lawmaker Erin Taada, stressed the need to look at specific government actions.Taada cited the case of Supt. Marvin Marcos, the leader of cops accused of the killing jailed Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa and another inmate in November 2016.Instead of pursuing cases of murders, what we have are downgrades, Taada pointed out.Marcos, then head of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group Region 8 (CIDG-8), was allowed to post bail after prosecutors downgraded the murder charges to homicide.Duterte also ordered the reinstatement of Marcos to active duty despite the homicide charges. The police officer was assigned to head the CIDGs Region 12 office.While criminal liability is personal, meaning people directly involved in killings, Olalia said, beyond that, moral and political responsibility leads all the way to the Palace.He accused Duterte of inducing, condoning and emboldening perpetrators of summary executions.Only lately, due to criticism and mounting protests, has the President tried to change the tenor of his drug-war rhetoric, Olalia added.We cannot differentiate legal responsibility from moral and political responsibility, he stressed.Command responsibilityDean Pacifico Agabin, a prominent constitutional law expert, slammed Dutertes war posture in the anti-narcotics campaign.The use of war is a propaganda device to create an image of strong resistance to the campaign, according to Agabin.To claim there is a war is misleading. Wala namang labanan, Agabin stressed.In 98% of these killings, the poor do not fight back; these were tricycle drivers, unemployed youth, he pointed out.He also cited command responsibility, which the country accepted when it ratified the Rome Statute in 2011.If there is a pattern of killings and commander in chief does not do anything, then he is responsible, Agabin said.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.","No EJKs?

Chances are they would because according to Duterte, in their brief meeting in Vietnam last week where they both attended the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Trump had nice words for him.Duterte told reporters upon his arrival early Sunday morning: Well, I shook his (Trump) hands. And before the closing, he kept on saying 'ba-bye'. I said beat the... And he said something about, 'you know, you handle it very well' Eh magyabang pa ako. Ayaw ko ng ano. I do not want to These are the things that you do not brag about: the Marawi and then the drugswords of encouragement. Not extrajudicial killing. Well, he cannot afford it. We do not talk about these things because, first of all, they are not true; and the second is, we do not do it. Asked if he will discuss EJKs with the U.S President? Duterte replied, Im sure he will not take it up.Duterte also said he got encouraging words from Chinese President Xi Jinping (China will be represented in this weeks summit by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang) and Russian President Vladimir Putin.The two leaders, he said, told him: We will support you. And we will provide you anything you need to solve this problem of terrorism pati sa drugs.If theres anybody who is expected to be concerned about Dutertes bloody method to solve the illegal drugs problem, it would be Canadas Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is attending this ASEAN event as guest of the chairman, this year being the 40th year of ASEAN-Canada relations. But there is no scheduled bilateral meeting between Duterte and Trudeau.Trudeau has been quoted in Canadas media as saying ""There are a range of issues that I could bring up with him, and I may bring [the killings] up with him if I have the opportunity, but there is no formal meeting with him.""The fist pump, which the Oxford dictionary described as a gesture of triumph or affirmation in which the forearm is raised with fist clenched, then swung downward toward the body in a vigorous pumping motion, is actually identified with leftist groups symbol of resistance to oppression.In the rallies against former President Marcos in the 70s and 80s, militants did the fist pump while singing the patriotic song, Bayan Ko.During the 2016 election campaign, Duterte shrewdly and successfully used it as his campaign symbol against government apathy towards the poor and elite snobbery.As he waged his brutal anti-drugs campaign, the fist pump has become a symbol of approval of the operations that have claimed the lives of thousands without the benefit of due process of law.It has also become a standard photo of Duterte with dignitaries and celebrities like Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe, businessman Jack Ma, and actor Steven Segal.Australias Intelligence Chief Nick Warner, however, was criticized for doing the fist pump with Duterte during his Manila visit last August as its foreign minister, Julie Bishop, had expressed concern about the Duterte governments drug killings.Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director, told Agence France-Presse, Foreign leaders should recognize that the fist... symbolizes a purposeful attack by Duterte on rule of law that has inflicted a human rights calamity on thousands of Filipinos. They should deny the architect of this human rights calamity the international recognition he undeservedly craves.""That the fist pump should even be a major concern in an ASEAN summit speaks a lot about the Philippine chairmanship of the regional organization 50th year anniversary.Blog: www.ellentordesillas.comEmail: [email protected]Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: Will Duterte and Trump (and other leaders) do the fist pump?
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"It has not been a week since lawyer Harry Roque started speaking for President Duterte and he has effectively taken the heat off the President.The last meeting of the President with media was upon his arrival from Japan last Oct. 31 where he was asked about his reaction to the statement of imprisoned senator Leila de Lima about not touching his son, Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte, and son-in-law, Manases Carpio, whose names were mentioned in the Senate investigation of the 604 kilos of shabu that slipped through the Bureau of Customs during the watch of former Marines officer Nicanor Faeldon.Duterte was as usual defensive: Who would believe me if I investigate my son and my son-in-law? Ikaw, can you investigate your mother or father? I leave it to the independent agencies --- theres the Human Rights, which is making all the noise, and they have the NBI.It was also in that presscon that he tried to douse cold water to the rumors that his daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, has plans to succeed him in Malacanang.He said: Maniwala ka pala niyan? Istorya yan Wala yan. (You believe that? Thats nothing) No. Inday is not interested. You know, Im telling you the truth.Duterte is not known for truth-telling. Remember he said several times before the 2016 elections that he didnt want to run for President.Meanwhile, Roque is on a roll, having the print and broadcast media all to himself. He is savoring it to the max.In an interview with Philippine Star columnist Jarius Bondoc and his wife, Marissa, on the couples radio program last Nov. 4, Roque shared his realization of the power of speaking from the Malacaang podium.He said, in his first press briefing in Malacanang, that he initially had qualms because in the House of Representatives, he enjoyed immunity. He could criticise other officials because they had to go to the congressmen for their budget. Pero matapos noong Lunes, napansin ko uy mas mukhang malakas na mikropono itong dito sa Press Briefing Room ng Malacaang (But after Monday, I noticed the microphone in Malacanangs Press Briefing Room is louder), he said.Bondoc asked if with malakas na mikropono, he was speaking literally and figuratively?Roque replied: Oo, literally and figuratively mukhangmaski wala akong kinalaman sa budget ngayon, eh mukhang mas hindi nila pupuwedeng isnabin ang mikropono ng Malacaang ano, kahit sino sa gobyerno ano. So, sabi ko, nawala na iyong alinlangan ko. (Yes, Oo, literally and figuratively. Even if I have nothing to do with their budget, they cannot snub Malacaangs microphone, anybody in the government. So, I said, I have no more doubts.) Roque elaborated: Siyempre ang pagkakaiba sa House, palagi kang may kasama no. Eh dito nag-iisa ka, at lahat ng media naroroon no. So kung mayroon kang isusulong para sa kabutihan ng bayan, eh magiging mas epektibo. Kaya nga for the first time, sabi ko tama talaga itong desisyon ko at wala na akong alinlangan, wala na akong panghihinayang doon sa aking pag-alis sa Kongreso. (Its different at the House where I was always with a group. Here, Im alone and all media outfits are represented. So, if you are pushing for something for the countrys good, its very effective. Thats why for the first time, I said I made the right decision, I do not regret leaving Congress.)Roque said he will be holding four press briefings every week. Regular press briefings are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Wednesdays, he will hold it in Marawi, and Fridays, he will go to the provinces.Roque has not been shy about his senatorial plans and Duterte already endorsed him during the Masskara Festival in Bacolod last Oct. 22.The media mileage that he is getting as spokesman will assure him of almost 100 percent awareness to the voters come 2019. But he has to impress them to make them vote for him.He has started working on the Diehard Duterte Supporters (DDS). Sixteen million voted Duterte to the presidency. If he gets majority of that, he has a good chance to make it in the Senate.The hollow block statement was for them: Binibigyan ko na po ng notice yung mga walang hiya diyan na naninira lamang. Kung dati-rati hindi kayo nababato bagamat kayoy nambabato, ngayon po maghanda na kayo dahil kung kayoy nambato, hindi lang po bato itatapon ko sa inyo, hollow blocks. (Im giving you notice, those shameless one. If before you are not hit even if you throw stones, now be ready because if you hit us with stones, its not only stone that I will throw t you. Hollow blocks).He explained: I was addressing Mocha Uson. I was addressing the 5.5 million followers of the Mocha Uson blog, these are the DDS. It was not really intended for anyone else other than the DDS.Thats how he regards the DDS.It seems Harry has finally found a position that suits his long-term objective.I dont know.

Bryant was playing in the final game of his NBA career. Photo by Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY SportsI'm not going to lie. It hasn't been easy to be a Los Angeles Laker fan for the past few years. After defeating the hated Boston Celtics in seven games back in 2010, life has been difficult for the Forum Blue and Gold. The death of team owner Dr. Jerry Buss; the David Stern-vetoed trade for Chris Paul; the disastrous moves that were the trades for Steve Nash and Dwight Howard; the subsequent departures of Andrew Bynum, Lamar Odom, and Pau Gasol, the coaches that followed Phil Jackson; all of these served to punch the collective guts of this once-proud franchise.Yet through all of those things, for two decades, there was one constant thing in Lakerland. A 6'6 shooting guard from Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. A cold-blooded killer who insane devotion to practice and getting the most out of his body drove some teammates crazy while earning him five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals. As Kobe Bryant's legendary career neared its end today, I couldn't help but reminisce about what he has done for 20 years wearing a Laker jersey. He could be frustrating, tantalizingly talented, enigmatic, positively infuriating, and (as he showed with a 60 point throwback performance in his final game) must-see TV at his purest.The kid from Lower MerionI remember the first time I saw Kobe Bryant on TV. The internet was in its infancy and I think I was watching ESPN SportsCenter when this skinny bald kid announced that he was signing a shoe deal with adidas. This was no Black Mamba, he was just a kid skipping college, as Kevin Garnett had just done and LeBron James would do a few years later. Kobe was supposed to be this high school sensation whose dad was an NBA player and former teammate of Julius Erving on the 76ers team that went to the 1977 Finals, but other than that, I didn't know much about the kid.I then heard that he was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick in the 1996 but that Jerry West and the Lakers had traded away Vlade Divac to get him. I still didn't know the kid, but he was now joining MY team, the team that had not won a championship since 1988 and had not been to the Finals since 1991. Joining forces with Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones, then adding another masterful West signee in Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers were suddenly contenders again. But I still thought that the kid would probably be a good back-up to Jones, not much more.Showtime part twoBy February of 1997, there had been buzz surrounding Kobe as the Lake Show began taking the league by storm. He cemented his place as someone to watch out for when he won the NBA Slam Dunk contest in purple adidas EQT Elevations while wearing a shooting shirt. That's just how skinny he was. I then saw the airballs he shot in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz. I witnessed the steely resolve in his eyes even after the Lakers were eliminated. Still, I wondered if he was good enough to start for the Lakers.When Phil Jackson became Los Angeles head coach before the start of the 1999-2000 season, Kobe had become entrenched as the starter as Jones had been traded for Glen Rice. The master of the triangle offense was brought in to bring order (and championships) to the Lakers's new home, the Staples Center. In just his first season in charge, Jackson did exactly that, and harnessed the duo of Shaq and Kobe to become one of the most feared and most effective pairings in the history of the NBA.Los Angeles Lakers forward Kobe Bryant (24) speaks to media following the 101-96 victory against the Utah Jazz at Staples Center. Photo by Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsThreepeat and dissolutionThis tandem would win a total of three straight titles together, and they could have had a fourth if Karl Malone had not been injured before the 2004 Finals against the Detroit Pistons. By then, the in-fighting had been public knowledge and it was becoming clear that Buss would have to choose between the massive O'Neal or the sleek Bryant. The Colorado incident didn't help matters as far as their relationship went or his public image as a selfish, petulant player. The trading of O'Neal to the Miami Heat and Jackson's first departure from L.A. meant that Kobe had won the war. He would no longer be reined in by his coach or have to share the ball with his talented but overweight teammate.What followed was Kobe on a mission: to prove that he was the best player in the league, that Buss made the right choice, and that he could will the Lakers to another title even if he had to carry the franchise on his back. The 81-point game was sensational, of course, but the years between 2004 and 2007 were difficult for someone who was nearing his athletic peak. Kobe was destroying all defenses thrown his way, but the Lakers were not winning titles anymore. He was getting frustrated with the team, with management and his teammates, and he was supposedly willing to be traded to the Bulls.Two more trophiesHowever, GM Mitch Kupchak and a returning Jackson convinced him to stay. The trade for Pau Gasol meant a talented big man was once again joining Bryant, and to everyone's surprise, they got along almost instantly. His only MVP trophy in 2008 was negated by a Finals loss to the archrival Celtics, but these new Lakers (with Kobe in charge) were not going to go away any time soon. Soon enough, Kobe snagged his fourth title the following season against Orlando for his fourth championship ring. In 2010, a much-awaited rematch against Boston resulted in an epic seven-game war that was the most grueling but also most satisfying yet as Kobe won one for the thumb.Cracks began to show in the Lakers' armor after that even as Kupchak tried to once again rebuild around Bryant. An attempted trade for Chris Paul was mysteriously voted down by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for the ridiculous answer of basketball reasons, effectively sabotaging the Lakers' immediate future. Nash and Howard were eventually brought to Staples, but Nash was a shadow of his former self while Howard proved to be an overrated, lazy, unmotivated waste of height who chafed under Bryant.Injured mamba and rock bottomIn spite of all these, Kobe was still pushing himself to his physical limit. With Mike D'Antoni as head coach, there were games when he would hardly spend time on the bench because Bryant felt that he needed to drag this squad to the playoffs. It all came to a head when his right Achilles tendon finally gave out in April 2013, the first major injury of his stellar career. Even though he tried to will himself back into competitive shape for the next few seasons, his body had begun to break down as it never had before. Meanwhile, the Lakers began to miss the playoffs on a regular basis, something unthinkable to scores of basketball fans.It was November of 2015 when Bryant told current Lakers coach Byron Scott that this current NBA season would indeed be his final one. News soon spread, and in a move not seen since Michael Jordan himself retired, every NBA city that the Lakers played in began to show Bryant something that he had never been given in 20 years: love.The unofficial Kobe Bryant farewell tour had been mostly a forgettable exercise for the Lakers. Even though they drafted D'Angelo Russell with the number two overall pick in last year's draft, no prized free agent came to LA and Byron Scott seemed overwhelmed with a largely untalented and young roster. There were few highlights to speak of and just when we thought things couldn't get worse, Russell was embroiled in controversy for filming teammate Nick Young who was admitting cheating on fiancee Iggy Azalea.Los Angeles Lakers forward Kobe Bryant (24) looks on after the Lakers defeat of the Utah Jazz 101-96 at Staples Center in Bryant's final game of his career. Bryant scored 60 points in the game. Photo by Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY SportsOne final magical momentWhat this final Kobe game against the Utah Jazz meant to the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles was more than a chance to say goodbye to its franchise player for 20 years. While it meant bidding a fond farewell to one of the most transcendent, popular, polarizing, and gifted players in league history, it also served as a reminder that when this franchise is great and the world is watching, it is something special to behold.Kobe delivered a one-of-a-kind 60 point performance with over 500 media people in attendance, a jampacked Staples Center, and a plethora of former Lakers and celebrities paying him tribute both in the venue and on video. By the end of the 101-96 Los Angeles win, he looked like he could barely walk, let alone run or jump anymore. He had, as he had done so many times in the past, willed himself and his team to victory.Bryant relished the role of the villain whenever he and his team would enter opposing NBA buildings. He would glare at fans, gnash his teeth, flash five fingers, or simply throw daggers into their collective hearts. He was loathed by critics who said he was selfish, never going to be the next Jordan, or just plain bad for the game. Yet for us who began to watch the kid in 1996 and see him evolve and grow up over the course of two decades, we loved him, warts and all. It was all those qualities that made us love him, it made us defend him in social media and in arguments with our peers. We rallied around Kobe because, unlike Jordan, he was hated so much by so many for being so driven to be the best in his craft.I bought and played in iterations of Kobe's signature shoes than I did of any other player before him. I have more of his jerseys than any other, even more than Jordan's jerseys. So when the curtain finally fell on his career yesterday, with a pass to Jordan Clarkson of all things, it tugged at my heartstrings. After Clarkson converted on the dunk and Julius Randle, Russell, and Clarkson all hugged Kobe collectively, it was like a father embracing his kids. The kid was indeed The Man now, and the next generation of Lakers would have to carry the torch as he did for so long.Amid the many tributes from competitors, teammates, people who he battled, and celebrities who were enthralled by his talents since he landed in Los Angeles, that performance was really the only way that Kobe should have gone out. He left the game gunning, and nobody, NOBODY, can argue that the Lakers didn't need every single point to win over the Jazz. This was not as great as the five championship celebrations, this team did not even come close to the playoffs, but Kobe gave the city of Los Angeles and Laker fans worldwide one final gift to remember him by. Mamba out, indeed.For more sports coverage, visit the ABS-CBN Sports website.",Hollywood Ending: The Final Game of Kobe Bryant

While it meant bidding a fond farewell to one of the most transcendent, popular, polarizing, and gifted players in league history, it also served as a reminder that when this franchise is great and the world is watching, it is something special to behold.Kobe delivered a one-of-a-kind 60 point performance with over 500 media people in attendance, a jampacked Staples Center, and a plethora of former Lakers and celebrities paying him tribute both in the venue and on video. By the end of the 101-96 Los Angeles win, he looked like he could barely walk, let alone run or jump anymore. He had, as he had done so many times in the past, willed himself and his team to victory.Bryant relished the role of the villain whenever he and his team would enter opposing NBA buildings. He would glare at fans, gnash his teeth, flash five fingers, or simply throw daggers into their collective hearts. He was loathed by critics who said he was selfish, never going to be the next Jordan, or just plain bad for the game. Yet for us who began to watch the kid in 1996 and see him evolve and grow up over the course of two decades, we loved him, warts and all. It was all those qualities that made us love him, it made us defend him in social media and in arguments with our peers. We rallied around Kobe because, unlike Jordan, he was hated so much by so many for being so driven to be the best in his craft.I bought and played in iterations of Kobe's signature shoes than I did of any other player before him. I have more of his jerseys than any other, even more than Jordan's jerseys. So when the curtain finally fell on his career yesterday, with a pass to Jordan Clarkson of all things, it tugged at my heartstrings. After Clarkson converted on the dunk and Julius Randle, Russell, and Clarkson all hugged Kobe collectively, it was like a father embracing his kids. The kid was indeed The Man now, and the next generation of Lakers would have to carry the torch as he did for so long.Amid the many tributes from competitors, teammates, people who he battled, and celebrities who were enthralled by his talents since he landed in Los Angeles, that performance was really the only way that Kobe should have gone out. He left the game gunning, and nobody, NOBODY, can argue that the Lakers didn't need every single point to win over the Jazz. This was not as great as the five championship celebrations, this team did not even come close to the playoffs, but Kobe gave the city of Los Angeles and Laker fans worldwide one final gift to remember him by. Mamba out, indeed.For more sports coverage, visit the ABS-CBN Sports website.",Hollywood Ending: The Final Game of Kobe Bryant
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"A FIBA official asked me during the course of the SEABA tournament: What will it take for these Southeast Asian teams to beat the Philippines? The Filipinos are altogether on another level from these guys.In my opinion, the answer doesnt lie in a program, naturalizing players, or even updating their training methods.The answer to that question is a fundamental one  you have to love, live, breathe, eat, and crap basketball like Filipinos.Until you (to our Southeast Asian neighbors), its like playing catch up. Its not easy.By the same token, you guys love, live, breathe, eat, and crap football that is why you are good at the Beautiful Game and we are the ones trying to catch up.Theres talent in the other countries national squads. Some are fundamentally good  close to robotic even -- but most lack that mid-air improvisation that Filipinos learned from playing the game on virtually every kind of surface or area available. ""Diskarte,"" as it is said colloquially.I recall how former Philippine national coach Rajko Toroman had a drill where players would take odd and off-balanced shots. As the Serbian coach reasoned out with me before: In basketball, there is a lot of improvisation. When you drive, you get bumped; when you take a jump shot  you get bumped or fouled  and you have to try and finish he play.It is no different from how football is played in their countries  not necessarily on the pitch  on roads, grasslands, cement courts, rice paddies.There needs to be a love for the game.If you look at the Vietnam mens team competing in Manila, it is only center Nguyen Van Hung who stays to watch the other matches. Well, hes older than most his teammates. While other know LeBron James or Kobe Bryant or Steph Curry, his favorite player is well old school for millennials. Michael Jordan, he says proudly.One team competing in this SEABA championships has this very bad habit of smoking after games and smoking after practice.There definitely has to be discipline.One coach said there isnt anyone he can talk to about basketball where he currently is at the moment. They practice, show up for a game and when those two hours are done, they forget the game. Here in Manila its basketball nirvana for me.The current dominance or program does mean the Philippines is infallible. As the saying goes, bilog ang bola and anything can happen. But a loss is like an aberration here in Southeast Asian. Beyond this region, there are no guarantees.But it all starts with a love for the game. A passion for it.The FIBA official countered my answer with this: If they do develop that passion or as you put it, they love, live, breathe, eat, and crap basketball  can they defeat the Philippines?My answer: Sure they can. The ball is round. But assuming their program bears fruit in 10 years time, I wonder where the Philippines will be by then.Maybe another level.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: What will it take to beat PH in SEABA
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Alvin Lim, ABS-CBN Sports Ateneo head coach Oliver Almadro.The Game 1 victory of the Ateneo Blue Eagles over the National University (NU) Bulldogs in the UAAP Mens Volleyball Finals has the fingerprints of its head coach Oliver Almadro.In the first set when it looked like NU would win running away with his team obviously rusty from a 23-day lay-off as a result of their elimination round sweep, Almadro told his team, I dont care what the score is. I want to see the energy and the intensity.The two-time defending champions responded with remarkable come-from-behind charge to take the set 25-22.However, they saved the best for last.With middle hitter Rex Intal unable to get going and the team looking somewhat out of sorts, NU came back to take the next two sets, 25-21 and 25-22.In the fourth set, Intal not only got going but so did the rest of the team. They took the fourth, 25-18, and stunningly, the fifth, 15-13, to come within a match of winning a rare trifecta in the sport since the league expanded to eight teams in 1986. In that time, only Far Eastern University and the University of Santo Tomas have won three straight (the latter won four straight from 2007-11).When I first followed the Ateneo program in 2006, Almadro was an assistant to Ronald Dulay. When the latter departed for UP two years later, he took over as head coach of the mens team. Their transformation was instantaneous although the cause for much palpitations and frustration. The team made the Final Four with its towering open spiker AJ Pareja, who is now a doctor, becoming the schools first most valuable player in UAAP mens volleyball. The next year, the team somewhat crumbled with the weight of expectations.They would race to a two-set lead and fumble away the last three. And this happened in several first-round matches. As a sign of frustration, he struck a player on his chest when questioning his heart.I was shocked that the players took this negatively and so did the athletics officials. Almadro was let go and he moved to NU where he eventually built a team that would win a championship (though not under his watch). I actually found it annoying as some of those players mocked Almadro. And where did they end up anyways? They actually floundered.And the fiery and intense Almadro was eventually brought back.I always thought he was like a grenade that was ready to explode. I have seen many like him  Joe Lipa and the coach he admired so much, the great Bobby Knight. Oliver is a great teacher, trainer, and motivator. He can be excessive too. And sometimes, I thought, he should learn to chill a bit and take a step back. But thats his way.I have heard there are times when the UAAPs reigning Most Valuable Player Marck Espejo gets ticked off by Almadros constant needling.But theres a method to all of this. I need to push them so everything else becomes easy for them, confided the coach some time ago. The mind games. The verbal jousts. The stare-downs. He tries to balance it with compliments.While Almadro has learned a thing or two working with his counterpart over at the womens side, Anusorn Bundit, he remains his own man with his trademark fiery style. So fiery that he drew a stern warning from first referee Jeff Lopez during Game 1.I guess I do need to take a step back, he conceded during a conversation a year ago during the teams celebration for a back-to-back crown. Its tough though. Its me kasi. Tough love too.It would be easy to say that he has very good players. But I beg to differ. When he first took on the team, they were but massive underachievers. Any game was an automatic win by the opponent even before they stepped on the court. Ironically, when they played NU, it was like a championship  to stay out of the cellar. And yet, the two schools have been the most dominant in the past five seasons including the off-season V-League tourneys.Yes, the Blue Eagles have the phenomenal Espejo. And they even have Tony Koyfman who when he realizes his true potential can be even more devastating considering his height and body structure. They also have Ish Polvorosa, their setter supreme.But Alamdro makes them go.I recall how years ago, on the eve of their first-ever Final Four berth (during his first go-around with the squad), he took them jogging in Luneta. Their starting point was at the statue of the schools most famous alumnus, Jose Rizal. This is where we start making history, he said. Whether his players believed him then or not (they sure did after the season), look at where they are now.They certainly are in a position to win it all for the third straight year. Yet even if they dont. Watching the sideline that Almadro patrols with that nuclear engine for a heart and a bullhorn for a voice, it sure is just as entertaining.For more sports coverage, visit the ABS-CBN Sports website.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: A method to Ateneo coach Almadro's madness
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Last February 9, the book, Philippine Football: Its Past, Its Future was launched at the Amici restaurant in Megamall. Authored by economist Bernardo M. Villegas, Ph.D. with key contributions various sportswriters, traces back the origins of football in the Philippines and its growth, decline, and eventual renaissance following the success of the national team in 2010.The book, two years in the making, and funded by the University of Asia and the Pacific with support from the Philippine Football Federation, is as close as a comprehensive telling of the nations footballing history.Sadly, for football, it slid from going high up to second in terms of popular sports to third as volleyball has displaced it. Watching the game from within and from afar, I believe it has slid in terms of popularity and awareness after arguably three-something years of growth from late 2010-14. It doesnt help that the Younghusband brothers, who became poster boys for the sport, arent top of mind anymore. There hasnt been a replacement on the horizon. Only the ardent supporters of the sport know whos who.I recall while working for Mindshare Philippines, pre-2010, the common question asked by media buyers and corporate sponsors for sports seeking patronage was, Whos there? You always need to put a face to the sport. It makes identification easier. Football had the Younghusbands and Chieffy Caligdong to a lesser degree, but after that its a crapshoot.In a study commissioned by the PFF, basketball topped the unaided awareness chart with a whopping 92% followed by volleyball at 75% and badminton at 36%. Boxing is fourth at 29% with football at fifth with a 28% awareness.However, when aided by promotional tools such as television, marketing, and advertising, footballs awareness jumps to 69%.I find it hilarious when people say that we should concentrate on football instead of basketball as it fits the Filipinos physique. That is not true at all. First and foremost, the beautiful game is the worlds most popular sport however, it isnt the most popular sport in every country. The United States, Canada, China, Japan, Lebanon, India, and many others will point to basketball, hockey, baseball, cricket and others as their national sport.The launch of the book Philippine Football Its Past, Its Future was attended by its author, Dr. Bernardo Villegas Ph.D., PFF President Mariano V. Araneta, and football supporter Danny Moran. The new Philippines Football League was also unveiled.Second, if it did fit the Filipinos physique, then why havent won anything all these years?I am not knocking football. I am all for football growing and getting bigger in this country but we do not need to knock down another sport. Yes, we are challenging now in Asia and that is good. I love it that our neighbors, who once who looked at facing the Philippines as an automatic win, are now preparing doubly hard for a fight. It sure is cool to see the team rise in the world rankings. Let the game grow organically and not in a faddish manner as some perceive the 2010 explosion to be.Before 2010, analysts said that what football needed was a professional league so the young can make a living out of the game. And I agree. Weve seen that in volleyball as well. While the game isnt on solid footing professionally, it is on its way. Before, outside basketball, the only way one could prolong his or her career was by playing in the military teams that were feeders for the national program. Like football, that is no longer the case. The club system is growing.As Filipinos learn and appreciate that sports can now be a means of living, so will attitudes change. But at most, it will take over a generation to change those beliefs. Again, I believe as the country opens itself to more ideas, so will change happen.Having said all of that, the PFF is organizing the first true national league called, Philippines Football League, and its slated for kick-off by mid-2017. As much as I love the United Football League (UFL) that carried the torch for club football for more than a decade, it was too Manila-centric. It is hoped that the regional allegiances and rivalries will give the PFL and the game a massive boost. There are an initial six teams with possibly two more joining the inaugural season.I am excited for this. Hopefully, lightning will strike twice but this time, the PFL will avoid the fate of the Metropolitan Basketball Association. For a while, the MBA put the fear of God in the PBA. It was played to roaring and packed crowds across the country. I myself switched and preferred to watch the more exciting MBA than what seemed like a staid PBA at that time. The league was blazing great guns until it was struck down by many factors. One of the many things that contributed to the leagues demise was the cost of airfare that saw teams flying all across the country. Along with the lack of a salary cap, that really killed many a budget. In this age of budget fares, it is thought that it wont hurt too much but that remains to be seen.Nevertheless, its time to give this sport, this professional league a go. It is key that they have identified 14 cities that could host a PFL club team. While not all of them will have a team come kick-off this year, at least preparations can be done for their eventual hosting.Its all good and it is definitely exciting.And that book of Dr. Villegas? The book teases about the future and the games growth. Hey, that needs telling too.","Ruminating about football, the PFL and its future"
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"A curious item in this weeks inflation rate report for October stood out for its puzzling rate of price increase. Of all the products in the food basket used by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in tracking inflation, fish registered the highest rate of increase: 9.5 percent overall, compared to the 1.1 percent to 5.8 percent noted in the other food itemsand there was even a 3 percent drop in the sugar, jam, honey, chocolate and confectionery products.In Metro Manila, the rate of annual fish price increases in October was recorded at 11.5 percent. Double-digit increases were also seen in five other regions across the country, with Bicol experiencing the highest at 14.3 percent. In the Negros Island Region, known for its seafood products, fish prices were up by 13.1 percent in October.In Manila public markets, the price of galunggong (roundscad), not too long ago referred to as the poor mans fish, now ranges from P120 to P150 per kilo. Another widely consumed fish variety, tilapia, costs around P100 to P130 a kilo, while bangus (milkfish) is priced around P100 to P140 a kilo.Fish is an important part of the Filipino diet. More than half of the animal protein we consume comes from fish. Any increase in fish prices in the magnitude of recent upticks, therefore, is bound to eat into the family budget in a big way. Around 40-45 percent of middle-class household expenses goes to food.Shrinking productionOne explanation for the steep fish price increases is the decline in fish catch over the past yearswith lower supplies, vendors tend to raise prices since demand will always be there. In 2016, according to the PSAs Fisheries Statistics, fisheries production totaled 4.36 million metric tons, down from 4.65 million in 2015 and from 4.69 million in 2014.In the first half this year, total fisheries output came to 2.13 million tons, a decline of 0.2 percent from the same period last year, although most of the increase happened in the first three months of the year and was nearly erased by a slower production in the succeeding three months.In terms of contribution to the economy, fishings share of gross domestic product (GDP) has been on a downtrend for nearly two decades now. In the first six months of this year, for instance, the total value of fishing production in real terms amounted to P54.15 billion, down from P54.63 billion in the same period last year and from P57.84 billion in 2015.Back in 2010, fishing contributed P136.5 billion to the annual GDP. This has since fallen gradually, hitting just P122.95 billion by 2016. If the value of fishing production in the second half of this year simply equals the amount in the first half, the total value for the full year will approximate the level recorded 13 years ago.Fishery resources are vastWhat gives? The Philippines, as an archipelago of more than 7,100 islands, has over 2.2 million square kilometers of seas known to have vast fishery resources. Said to have the highest marine diversity in the world, the Philippines was 11th among the worlds top fish producing countries in the early 2000s.The culprit, according to fishery officials and scientists, could be the history of unbridled overfishing and use of techniques now banned by the national government and localities, along with the effects of climate change on fish movements. But some analysts also attribute part of the problem to poaching on local waters by foreign groups.In the latest PSA report on the fisheries sector, fish catches by commercial and municipal fishers all registered declines in the second quarter of this year. Only aquaculture, says the report, managed to pull up its output.By species, roundscad posted the biggest rate of decline, by 19.4 percent from year ago to a volume of 59,000 metric tons in the second quarter. Yellowfin tuna production was 17.6 percent down at 24,600 tons, frigate tuna also by 17.6 percent to 35,000 tons, indian sardines by 12.7 percent with volume at 91,000 tons, and tiger prawns by 14.6 percent to 12.38 metric tons.Among the better-performing aquaculture varieties, bangus production was up by nearly 9 percent at 110,000 metric tons in the second quarter, and tilapia output rose by 6.6 percent to 84,000 tons.There was an overall 11.9 percent decline in commercial fisheries due to less unloading of species in the Navotas Fish Port brought about by an occurrence of frequent rains that hampered fishing operations in surrounding marine waters of Antique, Bataan, Zambales and the Visayan Sea, says the PSA report.Getting fewerAt several of the fishing grounds around the archipelago, fishers reported less appearance of popular species. Such was the case with roundscad in the fishing towns of Calabarzon region. In South Cotabato, scarcity of species was encountered by yellowfin tuna and big-eyed scad fishers, and in Bohol and Palawan, fishers also reported lesser appearance and less occurrence of indian mackerel.Fisheries officials also noted that strict implementation of registration regulations on fishing vessels, along with frequent rains that prevented fishers from making more trips to their fishing grounds. In a few areas, unregistered vessels (mostly bancas) were even confiscated by local authorities, according to fishers accounts.Government officials have been silent on the reported sightings of large Chinese fishing ships near certain productive locations in the South China Sea (also called the West Philippine Sea). Chinese coast guard boats escort these fishing ships, according to the reports.The reported sightings of Chinese fishing boats near Philippine fishing grounds tally with similar experiences of fishing industries elsewhere, including African nations where Chinese boats have been the subject of illegal fishing complaints.If this pattern continues, the galunggong will not only become a lot more expensive, it may eventually disappear from the poor Filipinos dinner table.",ANALYSIS: Where have all the fishes gone?
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"It has become customary for the Duterte economic managers to tell the people that the recent depreciation in the peso exchange rate is nothing to worry about and that a weak peso benefits exporters and families of Filipinos working abroad.Whenever you have a peso depreciation, that is favorable to our exports sector, which will then create more jobs, Budget Secretary Ben Diokno told a press briefing in Malacaang recently. The families of OFWs like this [depreciation] because that will increase their purchasing power, he added.Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said in a separate encounter with journalists that a peso depreciation increases government tax collections more than it pushes up expenditures. A decline in the peso exchange rate is a net gain for the government, he said.Such is the confidence of the economic managers that a further drop in the exchange rate even up to P52 to the US dollar will not worry them. The peso value at end-October stood P51.7990 to the dollar, a loss of nearly P2 since the start of this year.Impact on pricesThere are other effects of a peso depreciation that the economic managers have been silent about. One of them is the faster rate of increase in prices of goods. Recent increases have been caused by higher production and handling costs incurred by import-dependent manufacturers that are ultimately passed on to consumers.This was highlighted once more by the release of new inflation data by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). At the end of October, the PSA reported, consumer prices were up by 3.5 percent overall from last year. Mirroring the fall in the peso rate, the October inflation rate was significantly higher compared to 2.3 percent in the same month last year. The speed of price increases last October was also the fastest since November 2014.The faster inflation rate was driven by food prices, which in October were higher by 3.8 percent from the year before. Corn, meat and vegetables were among the food items that increased the most. Also reflecting the peso depreciation, imports-related prices in housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels rose by an overall 4.6 percent, according to PSAs calculations.Higher rates of price increases could be expected until end-2017, given that the last two months of the year usually see brisk consumer spending driving up prices. Also, manufacturers could be marking up their prices more aggressively to reflect the costlier petroleum products, equipment and raw materials they use in their operations.With this recent behavior in prices, obviously even the families getting dollar remittances from relatives abroad can be negatively affected. For instance, combined effects of peso depreciation and inflation could raise expenses for food, the largest item on the Filipino household budget, by over 15 percent to around P10,750 a month for a family receiving the peso equivalent of a $500 monthly remittance. That would leave around P15,150 a month, or nearly P505 a day, for other family expenses like education, transportation, medical and leisure.In the case of Filipino families with no dollar remittances to depend on, the effects of inflation pushed higher by a weak peso can be harsh, particularly in an environment of stagnant or shrinking household incomes exacerbated by a growing unemployment rate. As of July this year, there were around 2.37 million individuals without jobs, some 1.8 percent more than last year. Another 6.54 million were underemployed.It is no surprise therefore that public satisfaction with the governments record on 15 performance subjects has been lowest in fighting inflation, according to the latest Governance Report Card released by the Social Weather Stations (SWS).A net satisfaction rating of +24 on the governments ability to manage inflation was reported late in August by the SWS reflecting results of its survey conducted during the period June 23-27, 2017. The +24 rating on fighting inflation was just below the +25 net satisfaction rating on resolving the traffic problem, another major issue for residents of Metro Manila and a few other cities in the country.National debtEstimates from the Department of Finance ostensibly point to net gains for the government from a declining value of the peso in terms of projected increased pesos from Bureau of Customs collections, remittances from Filipinos abroad, and earnings from business processing outsourcing companies.Still, the pesos needed to pay for foreign currency-denominated obligations are also going up. Largely as a result of the peso depreciation, the national governments external debt (owed to other countries and foreign institutions) as of last September has ballooned by P99.4 billion in peso terms since the beginning of this year even though most of new borrowings incurred by the government are from local sources.The total peso amount of external debt, at P2.26 trillion as of end-September, was bigger by nearly 3.4 percent from the year-ago P2.18 trillion, according to Bureau of the Treasury data. Including obligations from local lenders, total outstanding national debt came to over P6.44 trillion.The increase in external debts peso value was equivalent to nearly 3 percent of the governments total budget for this year. That increase will also eat up almost 4 percent of all tax collections this year, based on revenue expectations of the Department of Budget and Management.Trade deficitOn trade, a peso depreciation has mixed results. Pesos generated from foreign currencies earned by exporters go up. On the other hand, exporters also need to import raw materials as well as machineries and parts regularly, and a weak currency results in more pesos having to be coughed up even for the same volume of these imports.Exports in the January-August period (latest available) totaled $42.11 billion, higher by 13.5 percent from the same 8-month period last year. On the other hand, total imports reached $59.15 billion, up by 8.2 percent.Despite the higher growth rate in exports as of August, imports still exceeded exports by $17.05 billion. The trade deficit, together with a retreat in foreign direct investment in local company equities, has pushed the overall balance of payments (BOP, a measure of the economys financial relations with the rest of the world) into a deficit this year from surpluses in previous years that were in part a result of strong dollar remittances from Filipinos abroad.As of the end of September, the BOP deficit stood at nearly $1.37 billion, compared to a surplus of $1.65 billion in the same month last year. A continued weakness in the BOP position usually results in a further erosion in the currencys exchange rate.Increasing risksThe World Bank Manila Office, in its latest Philippine Economic Update report released early in October, sees macroeconomic fundamentals remaining intact, but cites increasing risks to the countrys outlook.It says that increases in the US interest rates, seen to be triggered by coming Federal Reserve Banks rate adjustments, could lead to a further depreciation of the peso and continued capital outflows from the Philippines.Both the fiscal and monetary space to address risks can quickly diminish and limit the governments ability to mitigate those risks, the report says.Other analysts, including those at the research unit of Australian banking giant ANZ, see the Philippine peso to remain to be the Southeast Asian regions worst performing currency this year. The recent period of strong growth, the researchers point out, has led to imbalances in the economy that are intensifying.The Duterte economic managers appear to have miscalculated on their optimistic projections of a surge in investment that could add to production capacity and create more jobs. With these expectations, the economic managers went on a spending spree on long-gestating infrastructure projects and incurred big fiscal deficits as a result.Investors have remained adamant, with some even pulling out and relocating their operations elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, manufacturing, which was viewed as a key driver to growth, has reached its operating capacity and leaves little room for growth. The entry of more new investors can improve the situation.In the coming days, the Duterte economic managers will be extremely busy as they search for schemes to rebalance the economy. They cannot continue to tell the people that the peso depreciation is nothing to worry about.",ANALYSIS: Peso fall is something to worry about
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"A prospective investor in the Philippines usually takes 28 days to get a permit to open a business, going through 16 different procedures and paying various fees equivalent to $565.65 which is about 15.8 percent of the gross national income (GNI) per capita.In Thailand, one can get a business permit in 4.5 days, passing through 5 procedures and spending about $350 (6.2 percent of GNI per capita). In Vietnam, 22 days and 9 procedures, with estimated application costs of $133.25 (6.5 percent of GNI), are the comparable numbers.These are only a few of the factors that, according to findings in the latest World Bank annual Doing Business study, determine the pace of business activity and help create more jobs and lift people out of poverty in a country. The annual reports focus on promoting reform in about 41 different aspects of business regulation grouped into 10 indicator sets.The 10 categories are: starting a business; dealing with construction permits; getting electricity; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders; enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. World Bank teams and consultants, using a complex formula, score and rank the regulatory performance of economies covered in the study.Not in the annual reviews scope are such factors as macroeconomic stability and its impact on business, development of the financial system and market size, the incidence of bribery and corruption, and the quality of the labor force.113th among 190 nationsThe Philippines landed on 113th place among 190 states and economies covered in the 2018 report released this week. This marked a drop of 14 places from its rank in last years report, and down 10 places from the 2016 list.During the year under review (data as of June 1 this year), the Philippines scored high in reducing the time to get an electricity connection by implementing a new asset management system and by creating a new scheduling and planning office. For these moves, the Philippine regulatory status in getting electricity ranked 31st worldwide, which was still a downgrade, however, from the 22nd place the previous year in this same category.Another major reform initiated by the Philippines, making it easier for businesses to pay taxes through a new electronic system for payment and collection of housing development fund contributions, pushed the country to No. 105 worldwide in the paying taxes category, marking an upgrade from its 115th position the previous year.But the Philippines remains a laggard in the other key areas of business regulation: 173rd in starting a business (noted in the first paragraph of this article), 149th in enforcing contracts (enforcement takes up to 962 days, 146th in protecting minority investors (low ratings on shareholder rights, discosure and director liability), 142nd in getting creditall lower compared to the 2017 rankings.A saving grace is that in a Doing Business measure of a countrys distance to frontier (which compares the countrys score against those of the best performers), the Philippines 58.74 points represented a positive change of +0.42, interpreted by the World Bank analysts as an improvement in the overall business environment over the year in review.How neighbors faredAmong the 10 member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines was ahead of Cambodia which was on 135, Laos 141, and Myanmar 171. Cambodia and Laos had no known business-friendly reforms implemented during the period. Myanmar had one each in registering property and getting credit.Singapore, which maintained its No. 2 position overall, was the regions leader in making it easier to do business. Although it has been ahead for many years, Singapore still continues to initiate reforms to further make its policy framework attractive for business. In the latest study, Singapore got high marks for making exporting and importing easier by improving infrastructure and electronic equipment at the port, and making resolving insolvency easier by setting up a new scheme of arrangement procedure with features of the debtor-in-possession reorganization regime and introducing provisions applicable to prepackaged restructurings.Indicating the progress of their reforms in improving regulatory environment for local entrepreneurs, Thailand surged ahead by 20 steps to land on 26th spot, Indonesia climbed 19 positions up at No. 72, while Brunei and Vietnam moved up by 16 positions to No. 56 and 14 places to No. 68, respectively.Thailand and Brunei compiled the largest number of business regulation reforms among ASEAN nations8 each across the 10 indicator groupswhile Indonesia implemented 7 reforms. Thailand also made it to the top 10 improvers worldwide.For example, in the starting a business framework, Thailand has abolished the requirement to obtain a companys seal and eliminated the need for company work regulations approval from the Labor Department. Thailand has also strengthened minority investor protections by making it easier to sue directors in case of prejudicial related-party transactions, increasing shareholder rights and role in major corporate decisions.It is interesting to note that in the case of Thailand, despite its government being installed through a military takeover in 2014 and strict restrictions on certain activities and democratic freedoms, reforms toward making doing business easier have still been pursued.Thailand has recently announced a plan to launch in 2019 a comprehensive Doing Business portal to provide easier and faster services to business owners. Its gains in making doing business easier, according to analysts, could translate into a strong business environment and more good jobs for its people.The World Bank Doing Business report is the third global scorecard where Vietnam has overtaken the Philippines. In the United Nations Human Development Index released in March this year, the Philippines rank sustained a drop (the only country in the region to post a decline) while Vietnam moved up strongly to land on top of the Philippines. In September, in the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report, Vietnam also improved its attractiveness to investors and, along with Brunei, outscored the Philippines in the rankings.",ANALYSIS: How government can energize business
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Lee Kuan Yew, or LKY for short, belonged to a generation of strongmen in Southeast Asia who ruled their societies with iron fist and got together to bind the ten nations of Southeast Asia in friendship almost half a century ago. Was their authoritarian leadership style justified or not? LKYs passing today revives that debate.From Third World to FirstUnder LKY, Singapore progressed from Third World to First. He led Singapore after it was expelled from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965. Singapore stood its ground against occasionally difficult, even violent, relations with its two bigger neighbors  Malaysia and Indonesia.For many years now, Singapore remains among the top most competitive economies in the world according to the World Economic Forums global competitiveness reports. It has a GDP per capita higher than all countries in Southeast Asia combined, minus Brunei. Singapore is the only city in ASEAN belonging to the top 25 best cities in the world based on a report by Economist Intelligence Unit using data from worldwide cost of living and liveability surveys.Despite his many achievements, LKYs leadership is always associated with illiberal politics. Global leaders, including from civil society, are divided in their opinion of this Asian leader who strictly guarded his reputation at home while unapologetic for the way he led Singapore to where it is today. He ruled for more than three decades and had little tolerance for political opposition. He is also accused of elitism.This debate has outlived him and will continue to be relevant both for each nation of Southeast Asia as well as for ASEAN as a group in their collective efforts to build a political and security community based on common norms.Procedure or performance?The East-West Center published in the mid-1990s a study on political legitimacy in Southeast Asia looking into the cases of the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The study concludes that there are several sources of legitimacy from procedure to performance. It observes that legitimacy is an interactive process between rulers and the ruled and, therefore, should be analyzed in the context of specific society at a specific time.In the case of LKY, he firmly believed that what matters most was performance. He once said that, the existence of Singapore leadership depended on performance, extraordinary performance.In the case of the Philippines, interrupted only during the period of Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos, our political and constitutional tradition seems to prefer procedures associated with popular sovereignty as the primary source of legitimacy.We are where we are today because of that choice. Not that that choice was inherently bad, but because of what we have made of that choice.We have a procedural democracy that is chronically violated by greedy and corrupt leaders both from government and business sectors. We have a procedural democracy which is incapable of unleashing our economic potential for the benefit of the majority, especially the poor. Ours is a soft state that is incapable of sustaining a reform agenda.The East-West Center study states that legitimacy could determine the effectiveness of governance, the scope, pace, and method of political change, and the conduct of the state abroad. It is both cause and effect. In the end, therefore, both procedures and performance are important. They could mutually reinforce each other toward a durable and stable basis of authority.Today, many nations of Southeast Asia have transitioned towards constitutional democracy. While this may not necessarily indicate the end of history or the final form of human government, as put by Francis Fukuyama, it probably means that it is robust enough to be able to adapt or have various forms for different societies and times.For example, a parliamentary system of government, which is common in the ASEAN region, has the advantages of both keeping the right of suffrage during elections and of running a unified and strong government in between. Whether or not this is good for us depends of course on the quality of those elected and the ability of the electorates to make the right choices.LKY has shown to all developing countries what is possible under an effective and visionary leadership. We may or may not like his style, but what he has achieved should inspire us to work harder for our own nation building and to find our proper place in the community of nations.--------------Jun Abad is Senior Fellow of the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies (ISDS) in the Philippines and former director of the ASEAN Regional Forum Unit at the ASEAN Headquarters in Jakarta.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanIts a sight familiar to many CEOs in Makati, yet also one any local government executive elsewhere would envy: The skyline of the city, as seen from the top office of the highest city hall in Metro Manila.The coast stretches out on the far right. Low-rises fill the foreground, towered by the skyscrapers that have long given identity to the Philippines main business district.The elements of the first represent the history and people of this 345-year-old town: churches, trees and decades-old apartment blocks.The structures of the latter capture the progress this city has reached in the past half-century, with more office spaces and condominium units under construction.This is the view that daily meets Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay, more known as Junjun, at his desk in the city halls 21st floor.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanFor him, this mix of past, present and future, seen in panorama through six-feet-high windows, also represents the legacy of his family to the city, whose helm they have held for 30 years.Its a view he is not keen on giving up with ease.Since March 11, Binay has not left the city hall compound, surrounded in this floor and on the ground floor by supporters willing to physically defend the second-term mayor.The metal roll-down doors of the buildings main entrances have stayed down the whole time. Two slightly opened roll-downs in front during office hours and at the basement driveway the rest of the day are the only routes in.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanAt least three of the seven elevators servicing the entire city hall were left operationaland not all to the topmost floors. To get to the 21st many had to walk four flights of stairs in the fire exit.Binay continues to defy a six-month preventive suspension order from the Office of the Ombudsman following an administrative case against him, his father and several city officials.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanJutting out on the left side of the city hall as one looks down is Building 2, the focal point of the case.The P2.2 billion annex containing additional parking and offices has also been the subject of a long-winding Senate investigation for supposedly being overpriced.While transactions and services in the main building were hampered by the standoff, frontline offices at building 2 remained open.Its not the first allegation that Binay and his father Jejomar, the former mayor and now vice president, misused public funds. But their camp claims the timing of this case is political persecution by the ruling party designed to hamper the elders presidential ambitions.Five days after the suspension was issued, police attempted to enforce the order. Vice-mayor Romulo Kid Pea was sworn mayor the next day, and yet only three hours later, the Court of Appeals paused the suspension.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanThe tension has nonetheless subsided a week since. Gone are the planks propped up by pieces of timber against the lower fire exits of the first building, put there in fear of a takeover.Still, the outcome of the legal pingpong involving the city mayorship remains in question.Both Binay and Pea stand their ground: The first still sleeping in at the 21st floor, the other planning to hold office at the four-floor old city hall directly in front.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanBinays supporters have held vigil for nights in the parking lot between the old and new buildings.Free fast food packs abated the hunger; standup comics, dancers, zumba instructors and even boys declaiming poems sated boredom. Statement shirts and slogans on tarp abound.When asked, the supporters loudly claimed allegiance to the mayor, and also to his father. One said, Until death!Seven days after, tents and supporters no longer occupy the parking lot. But theyve moved to the ground floor of city hall. Many have laid out pieces of cardboard to sleep in, a number of them barefoot.The vigils and the standoff are nothing new. Back in 2006, when the Binays were also on the opposing end of the administration, a suspension order stemming from charges of ghost employees was leveled on the elder Jejomar.Holed up at the 21st floor until he also got a temporary restraining order, the elder Binay went on to finish his term and even moved to higher office.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S. BagaoisanFor Binay the younger, holding the fort also means distance from the children he parents on his own.Its a sacrifice on my part, but I have to do it, he said. Because this is not for me. This fight is for the people of Makati.Dogged for some, hooked to power for othersespecially the commenters on social media.The view from the top hardly reflects the chaos going on at the ground.No Makati mayor except Junjun and his father has worked facing this skyline. With such a view, a political scuffle sounds like the least of ones problems.And if the precedent is any indication, for the next few years a Binay will still be mayor of all he surveys.Photo by Andrew Jonathan S.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"It has been less than a year but despite the perceived popularity of the administration of President Rody Duterte, it is now encountering problems at almost all fronts.The recent arrest of Dutertes known political nemesis, Senator Leila de Lima will not silence those opposing the present administration. On the contrary, it has actually further galvanized support for De Lima and has emboldened more Filipinos to speak up against Duterte and his allies.The problem with De Limas arrest is that it is primarily based on the testimonies of convicted hard-core criminals like Herbert Colanggo who eventually received special privileges from our Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre right after they testified against De Lima.Now, Aguirre is even moving for the charges of these criminals to be dropped in exchange for them to testify against De Lima. How can you now say that their statements are credible after knowing that they actually got something in return for making up these statements?People are also now beginning to question Dutertes war on drugs given that up until now, high-profile drug lords such as Peter Lim also continue to remain free despite him publicly saying several times that Lim is one of the top drug lords in our country.The reawakening of the ChurchThe Church, which was disturbingly quiet during the first few months of Duterte, has now awakened and has decided to lead the fight against the rampant extrajudicial killings and the planned reimposition of the death penalty in our country.During their recent ""Walk for Life"" held at the Quirino Grandstand, the Church led by Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle and Archbishop Socrates Villegas once again showed that it can muster numbers just to show the present administration that it will not remain silent on issues that already concern the morals of our people.As Archbishop Oscar Cruz warned our political leaders, there have been several political leaders throughout history that went against the Church but they have since passed on while the Church despite all its flaws and weaknesses has remained strong.Dutertes tenuous hold of the SenateIn addition to these, the sudden change of heart of SPO3 Arturo Lascanas is also causing panic among the allies of the President.Through a hastily called press conference at the Senate last Monday, Lascanas, with the support of Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) lawyers, named Duterte as the one who was calling the shots for the notorious Davao Death Squad (DDS).This corroborates the earlier statements made by former DDS hitman Edgar Matobato who also pointed to Duterte as the person who perpetuated the murder of several people in Davao City.Senate allies of Duterte led by Senator Richard Gordon tried to stop the reopening of the investigation but they were surprisingly outvoted and thus, the Senate investigation and hearing on the DDS will begin next week with Lascanas as the main resource person.Due to this, Malacanang immediately called its allies in the Senate for a meeting to discuss how they will be able to minimize the damage that will be done to Duterte when Lascanas appears before the Senate committee on Public Order chaired by Senator Ping Lacson.This event shows that Duterte does not hold a big majority in the Senate, which makes him politically vulnerable in the coming months. Without a Senate majority, Duterte would also be unable to pass his priority bills that include the reimposition of the death penalty and charter change towards federalism.Conflicts inside the Duterte CabinetIn his own Cabinet, Duterte is also facing some major headaches with the clash between Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Gina Lopez and Department of Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez on the recent order given by Lopez to shut down the operations of several mines in our country.This couldve been avoided if only there was proper communication and consultation within the concerned Cabinet members before Lopez released the order to close down the mines. Now, Duterte may be left to choose between supporting Lopez, who is now under attack from different business groups, or backing his close friend Dominguez.Duterte should now focus on leading our countryFor the sake of our countrys future, Duterte should now focus on leading and solving our countrys problems instead of focusing his time and energy on attacking his political enemies.In the next few months, Filipinos will now ask what this administration has concretely done to make their lives better.Traffic is still very much present and even getting worse by the day. The peso has depreciated considerably which may eventually lead to higher prices of basic commodities. The peace process with the CPP-NPA that was supposed to be one of the major highlights of this administration has been terminated.There is still much time to turn things around and prove to everyone that the 16 million Filipinos who voted for him made the right decision.Comments are welcome at [email protected]Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: Cracks now showing in the Duterte administration
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Yesterday, retired SPO3 Arthur Lascanas faced the public to reveal the existence of the Davao Death Squad implicating President Rody Duterte in its operations, including the brutal massacre of a family that included an innocent and helpless 5-year-old boy. What did he have to gain by doing this?Nothing. He in fact put his and his family's life in danger now by pitting himself against the most powerful man in our country who is widely known for having his enemies killed. He didn't have to do this, he simply could've made his familys life much easier by just keeping quiet.Testimonies in exchange for freedomA few months ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) led by Sec. Vitaliano Aguirre paraded a group of high-profile drug convicts and murderers such as Herbert Colanggo, Vicente Sy and Peter Co in Congress and the Senate to pin down staunch opposition Senator Leila De Lima. What did these convicted criminals have to gain by doing this?Well, right after they testified, they were given special privileges in their detention cells such as airconditioners, internet access, cellphones and even Smart TVs. Aside from this, Aguirre announced that they are now moving for the dropping of their drug charges in exchange for their ""testimonies"" against De Lima.Now, the question is, who will you believe? A man who is now risking his life so the public would know the truth about the spate of extra-judicial killings that is happening in our country or a band of convicted hard-core criminals who will do anything just to be able to get their freedom? I think the answer here is pretty obvious.Is the Liberal Party behind all of this?In another related story, die-hard Duterte supporters are now saying that it is the Liberal Party (LP) which is behind the recent revelations made by Senator Antonio Trillanes against our President.These die-hard supporters obviously dont do much research and just parrot whatever they hear from known Duterte apologists. Trillanes isnt a member of the LP nor was he ever part of LP. Trillanes is actually a member of the Nacionalista Party (NP), which counts known Duterte allies, Senators Alan Peter Cayetano and Cynthia Villar as its leaders.True to form, when something goes wrong in this administration, just blame the LP and hope that the people will actually believe them.Comments are welcome at [email protected]",OPINION: The curious case of SPO3 Lascanas and the Bilibid drug lords
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"And how Duterte is copying it--and its economic implication(Supporters of the Marcoses and President Rodrigo Duterte are  as usual - twisting what I said before the Filipino Staff Association of the World Bank Group-International Monetary Fund.To let readers judge for themselves, I am posting my talk of October 26, 2017 delivered at the World Bank headquarters in Washington D.C. before members of the Association.)I would like to thank the Filipino Staff Association of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund for having me, especially its president Phil De Imus.Raissa Robles (center) with Phil de Imus (left), president of the Filipino Staff Association of the World Bank Group-International Monetary Fund, and the association's Vice President, Gaio Gonzalez.Raissa Robles with some members of the Filipino Staff Association of the World Bank Group-International Monetary Fund.While my cousin Gaio Gonzalez suggested me, I know you have a strict vetting process on who to invite to your forums. I am therefore very glad I passed your test.I would also like to thank Filipinos for a Better Philippines, my publisher for pursuing my book, as well as my husband Alan, who meticulously edited the book.As an investigative journalist, I have often used World Bank and International Monetary Fund reports as primary documents. The most useful parts for me have been the numerous tables and graphs scattered throughout each report, which the media have difficulty getting access to.I remember receiving leaked reports of both institutions when the Philippines transitioned from a dictatorship to a democracy.Those were very difficult days for many of us in the Philippines, so much so that even those who did not understand what the phrase IMF prescriptions meant learned to associate it with that horrible, horrible anti-stomach ache stuff from childhood called paregoric.When I did my research for my book Marcos Martial Law: Never Again I found out that the IMF gave Marcos an emergency loan shortly after he won his second and final term as president in 1969. In return, the IMF exacted from Marcos a painful antidote - the devaluation of the Philippine peso from 3.90 pesos per dollar in 1969 to six pesos in 1970.The steep drop in the pesos worth created major social unrest and caused prices of goods to skyrocket.The rest of Marcos final four-year term as the countrys first reelectionist president was marred by student unrest. He would have ended his term by 1973 if he had not illegally imposed Martial Law in 1972.Military rule was initially good for the country in terms of economic indicators but not in terms of peoples rights. In 1976, just as the world first heard of the torture being committed by the military against political dissenters through a report by Amnesty International, Marcos scored another coup.The Board of Governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund agreed to hold its annual meeting in Manila in 1976.I recall, for that meeting, the brightest students in Manilas schools were asked to serve as usherettes. By so doing, the Fund gave Marcos brand of constitutional dictatorship its stamp of approval.Manila didnt have enough hotels to hold the delegates.No problem. A US$500 million loan with government guarantee was extended to the Marcos government and Imelda rushed the construction of 18 luxury hotels, which later turned out to be owned by the Marcoses through certain dummies.Let me just say that the WB, the IMF and the Marcoses were cozy companions.However, the following year, 1977, an urban poor leader from Manilas poorest district Tondo was arrested by soldiers and brutally tortured. She was electrocuted using a US-made military field telephone. The wires were initially wound around both her thumbs.In 2012, Herrera by then 71 years old, narrated her ordeal to local TV5 station.She said the four men in the room - her interrogators - stripped her naked and made her stand barefoot on the ground, on which they poured water to magnify the electric shock.So whenever the crank of the field telephone turned, she said, the current shot through her body.I kept screaming and screaming even though no one would be coming to my rescue, she said.They kept asking me if I was a member of the Communist Party. I denied it and said I was the President of Zone One Tondo Organization.Because her answers were not satisfactory, the wires were transferred to both nipples. She recalled 35 years after her torture:I felt very much degraded, very much. I lost control of myself then.In 2015, one of her accused torturers, Col. Eduardo Matillano, allowed me to interview him. He could not recall the name of the torture victim who was the reason for his court martial. But he emphasized that she was a ""subversive.When I asked him whether the woman was really tortured, he laughed out loud at my blunt question, then fell silent. The silence felt like a wall between us. Then he broke the silence and said, I was tried for it, but I was acquitted.Later, Col. Matillano opened up to me why torture was happening. He replied, When I want to get information first - who are your companions, where are they, how do you conduct your activities.Thats our method of forcing him to talk, because its easier, he told me.You know, he casually told me, its very tiring - aaaa - to keep punching a person.Trinidad Herrera would have rotted in jail indefinitely like over 50,000 detainees, if not for the timely intervention of the US Embassy, prodded to action by no less than the American First Lady then, Rosalynn Carter. And, for the support of American church officials as well as an unlikely ally - the World Bank, which was familiar with Herrera's organization.Why do I bring up the Herrera case when my topic for today is -1) How could Martial Law Happen,2) a discussion of Marcos Martial Law,3) how President Rodrigo Duterte is copying Marcos formula for imposing authoritarian rule, and4) the economic implications of another Martial Law.Because I would like to emphasize that behind the graphs and statistics of multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the IMF are millions of human lives affected by loan agreements, by borrowings that grow sour, and by the collapse of an economy kept alive by a transfusion of emergency loans.Today, the Philippines is being confronted once again by a choice - whether to go forward as a democracy or as a one-man rule.In my most recent talk, someone asked me what I thought of President Rodrigo Duterte setting up a revolutionary government since the 16 million people who voted for him already agreed to support him on this.First of all, I answered, please do the math. Of 54 million registered voters, Duterte was voted into office by only a third. Insofar as the presidential elections were concerned, 16 million was enough to get him elected president since its winner take all.However, the Philippine Constitution is quite clear - that in order to change the form of government, the proposed changes have to be approved by a simple majority of votes cast. This means, for instance, if 81% of the 54 million voters cast their votes, the changes need at least 21,870,001 votes.In short, the government needs 5 million more votes on top of the 16 million who already voted for Duterte.Before I go on, let me clarify what I mean by Martial Law and revolutionary government. Martial Law was merely the means for President Ferdinand Marcos to set up his own revolutionary government. By proclaiming Martial Law, Marcos was able to call out the military to illegally shut down the media, the Congress, and arrest 60,000 people in the first weeks alone.Because he had stamped down on dissent, Marcos was free to violate the Philippine Constitution of 1935 and set up his revolutionary government with the least resistance. Some of you may recall that he published a book called Revolution from the Center: how the Philippines is using martial law to build a new society.I maintain that what Marcos did was patently illegal. Yes, he had the power as Commander-in-Chief to call out the army to quell rebellion - although he himself told the US Ambassador there was no sufficient basis.But no, he did not have the power to use Martial Law in order to reform society. That was not written in the constitution.Reform society happens to be what President Rodrigo Duterte claims said he wants to do as president.Duterte had the power to call out the army to suppress lawless violence in Marawi City. However, he does not have the power to use martial law to institute political reforms, which is what his close allies are urging him to do.Martial law is a power intended only for extreme emergencies. It is like the electric shock administered on a patient whose heart has momentarily stopped beating. It is not meant to be a constant thing or the new normal, which is what Marcos made it from 1972 to 1986. Marcos was a dictator who ruled as he pleased by decree. Anytime he felt like doing something, he ordered it, writing out the law as he pleased. There was no check or balance on his power.Because of what Marcos did, the 1987 Constitution that was approved a year after Marcos fled, placed safeguards to prevent a repeat of Marcos Martial Law.However, a revolutionary government can be put in place by Duterte even without declaring Martial Law. All he needs to do is get Congress to back him up and approve a resolution by three-fourths vote to put up a revolutionary government.At this time, I believe the President can easily gather 3/4 of the vote in the House of Representatives. I am not sure, though, if he has 3/4 or 18 votes in the Senate.The vote of the senators is not necessarily a sure thing. Why? Because one of the proposed amendments they would be supporting if they voted yes, would be the destruction of the Senate. One of the proposed amendments is to have a unicameral assembly. This would mean abolishing the Senate and cutting short the terms of office of the 12 senators who were voted in 2016.The final step to setting up a revolutionary government is to have the changes approved in a plebiscite. The Philippines has never conducted a plebiscite to approve changes in the Constitution.It is Congress that will define by law how a plebiscite will be conducted. Congress could even decide that, like the Citizens Assemblies that approved the Marcos Constitution, approval will be by viva voce. Meaning, the crowd will merely be asked to shout out aye or nay and whichever side shouts loudest will win.I believe, however, that the plebiscite will be added as a rider to the coming polls to elect barangay officials by next year.The best time that President Duterte could act is by next year, since mid-term elections are in 2019 and the political wind might suddenly change.There are indications that the ruling party is hurrying to do just that. House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez has announced that constitutional change is on top of his legislative agenda.President Rodrigo Duterte has made reassuring noises that even if he declares a revolutionary government, he does not intend to stay on for long. That he would step down as soon as it is put in place.Should we take his word for it?Probably not, because he keeps changing his mind.He promised a drug war that would last only for six months. Now he is saying it will last his entire term. He promised to ease Manila traffic. Now it is worse. He promised businessmen that only five signatures would be needed to start a business. That hasnt happened.I could go on and on.Yes, he has delivered on some promises. Such as extending the passport validity and drivers license.Now what are the signs that President Duterte is bent on setting up a revolutionary government, and/or declare martial law?I see eight of them.Number one, no other president since Marcos has ever talked so much about the need to declare Martial Law or the desire to establish a dictatorship. He just keeps talking and talking about it. Is he joking? I doubt it.Number two, no Philippine president since Marcos ever declared a state of emergency nationwide after just one bombing. Which is why Martial Law veterans suspect this is but a prelude to Martial Law.Number three, Ferdinand Marcos resorted to Citizens Assemblies to ratify the charter which legalized his dictatorship. Even as I speak to you today, the Duterte government is frantically organizing at the grassroots level a group called Kilusang Pagbabago or Movement for Change. It will, among others, push for a federal type of government. Doesnt the name remind you of Marcos Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan or Movement for a New Society?Number four, like Marcos, Duterte promised to increase police and military pay.Number five, one of the first things that Marcos did in preparation for declaring martial law was to expand the size of the military, especially those units directly under his most faithful general Fabian Ver. Duterte, for his part, told Reuters news service before the May 2016 elections that he would form two new army divisions to tackle security threats. Thats around 8,000 men. If he does that, this would in effect constitute a strike force, an army within an army, which was basically what Marcos had with General Ver.Number six, Duterte said he would execute drug traffickers, just like Marcos who executed Chinese national Lim Seng for drug trafficking after imposing Martial Law, which made the general public like Martial Law. Actually, the number of extrajudicial killings under Duterte has reached ghastly proportions. Nearly every night, there are murders of drug suspects or persons of interest.Number seven, Duterte threatened to smash Congress if the lawmakers opposed his fight against crime. Marcos did smash Congress in 1972. Also, Duterte said that if Senate tried to impeach him over allegations of hidden wealth, he would shut down Congress. Before Marcos had imposed martial Law, calls were mounting to have Marcos investigated for his hidden wealth abroad.Number eight, Duterte has more or less gotten the acquiescence of the Supreme Court in all his key moves. The high court endorsed his reasons for declaring martial law in Mindanao, although on the face of it, the conditions specified by the constitution were not met. It has endorsed his arrest and jailing of his political enemy, Senator Leila de Lima.You will probably ask - how can Duterte do it when he promised a parliamentary-federal type of government? Actually, he also promised a revolutionary government.But in any case, there is nothing to prevent him from breaking promises.Philippine history shows that on the two occasions that the country switched from one form of government to another, the political institution underwent a transition period. It was this transition period that Marcos exploited to entrench himself in power. During his time, the country never actually transitioned from the presidential to the parliamentary form of government.Marcos caused to be embedded in the 1973 Constitution a section on Transitory Provisions. This section legitimized Marcos decree or law making powers even while the National Assembly was in session.Not only that, Marcos could even assign other entities to draft the laws which he would then sign. Among those entities that was actually writing laws during Martial Law was the Philippine Constabulary.There are calls now for Duterte to head the transition period when the form of government shifts from presidential to parliamentary-federal.I can tell you with confidence that whoever heads the transition government can do anything. And I mean anything.For instance, Marcos got the Constitutional Convention delegates - which by the way included somebody named Richard Gordon - to campaign for the ratification of the 1973 Constitution. In exchange, the delegates would automatically get a seat in the planned National Assembly.Marcos fooled them all. He never convened the National Assembly. Instead, he wrote a decree or law creating the Interim Batasang Pambansa or IBP and convening this five years later in 1978. Since it wasnt the same banana as the National Assembly, Marcos did not have to fulfill his promise to the Constitutional Convention delegates, which by the way also included the late President Diosdado Macapagal.A somewhat similar betrayal took place during the post-1986 people power after President Corazon Aquino replaced Marcos. She had promised the post of Prime Minister to Salvador Laurel, her running mate at that time.Laurel enjoyed the post only for a month because on March 25, 1986, Mrs Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3 putting in place a Provisional Constitution, better known as the Freedom Constitution. It abolished the post of Prime Minister who was in charge of running the government day-to-day. Ms. Aquino replaced the post with the Vice President, a mere spare tire.We can see that a transition period could give the person at the very top awesome powers that could be used to establish authoritarian rule or a democracy.Duterte has shown a marked inclination toward authoritarian rule.Finally, lets consider the question - would a revolutionary government be good for the economy and the people?The World Bank actually has part of the answer to that. A link to the website page called Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative shows a summary of the ill-gotten wealth cases of the Marcoses. The page is co-sponsored by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime.The problem with strongman rule is that the strongman does not want to be criticized and made accountable. During Marcos time, that led to unprecedented corruption which eventually sank the economy and brought on misery and poverty. Marcos used his power for himself, his family and his cronies. They siphoned billions of dollars for themselves and stashed much of it abroad.In closing, I would like to emphasize that one thing that the Marcos period should have taught us is that without the checks and balances of other institutions like Congress, the Judiciary and the free press, a dictator is free to define who a criminal is, who can be arrested and who can be put to death.When all the institutions of democracy are destroyed or suppressed, or bought, then it is down to the citizenry, to the public, to make a choice. Live with the dictatorship or resist. It is not an easy choice.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: How could Martial Law happen?
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"(My speech sponsored by the Gallatin Human Rights Initiative and Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University in New York City on October 24, 2017. The discussants were: Dr. Jerome Whittington of the NYU Department of Anthropology and Ruben Carranza of the International Center for Transitional Justice. Dr. Whittington specializes in the study of climate change and how it affects societies, particularly in Thailand and Laos. Atty. Carranza was once a commissioner of the Presidential Commission on Good Government and an undersecretary at the Department of National Defense.)In Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, we hear a lot of eerie echoes of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.Duterte has not bothered to hide his admiration for Marcos. Duterte has repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the Marcos family for supporting his candidacy and has said he wants to see Marcos son Bongbong succeed him.Politically, Duterte behaves like hes following the dictators playbook. He repeatedly says he wants to declare martial law and set up a revolutionary government - which in effect would make him accountable to nobody. He is slowly eroding or suborning the various branches of government and is placing increasing reliance on the Philippine National Police.President Duterte shares the same language as Marcos and the same strongman ideology that Marcos laid out as a dictator.Marcos described his dictatorship with the coined phrase constitutional authoritarianism. He did not define the word authoritarianism. But on page 51 of his book, ""In Search of Alternatives: The Third World in an Age of Crisis"" published in 1980, Marcos argued that his form of of governance is not the traditional textbook form of martial law or authoritarianism.Writing during martial law, Marcos asserted that ours is the only authoritarian state, the only regime under martial law that has allowed its policies and programs to be questioned in open court. Our Supreme Court has, on many occasions, questioned us and even caused us to suffer reversals.Marcos was right of course. He allowed the Supreme Court to function because he had already stacked the cards in his favor. While the Supreme Court did question some of his decisions, the major ones were never reversed. And as a further guarantee of good behavior, all justices of the Supreme Court were required to submit a pre-signed letter of resignation which Marcos kept in his Palace drawer. Few dared to oppose him, the entire judiciary was cowed.On page 50 of the same book, Marcos explained the use of the word constitutional. He said: I rush to submit, first of all,the distinction that the authoritarianism we exercise is constitutiona-- it is based on the Constitution and it is limited by he Constitution.Marcos called constitutional authoritarianism the third alternative for developing nations. He described constitutional authoritarianism on page 154 of the same book as the third way: not a compromise between dictatorship and democracy, but the disciplined way to democracy.He enumerated the two other ways of governing as the liberal, consensus type of democracy and the totalitarian form of government. He said the first type resulted in stalemates and deadlocks, and consequent delays, animosities and stagnation.The second alternative, he said, is likely to be abjured, being too extreme in its conduct and precepts. Its chief vice, of course, is its brutal denial of human rights, Marcos explained in his book.Apparently, Marcos did not see any brutal denial of human rights in his third way. He wrote: The inescapable choice is authoritarianism for a limited time, the legitimate exercise of authority proceeding from law or the Constitution.DUTERTE'S BRANDNow why do I bring up constitutional authoritarianism 30 years after the Marcos were booted out of power.I am bringing it up because the very same words are being uttered right in the heart of the presidential palace. No less than Dutertes presidential legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, has elaborated on Marcos brand of dictatorship as the kind of government that Duterte should form.Panelo, on September 15, 2016 - the eve of the anniversary of Marcos declaration of Martial Law - said on TV that Duterte should form a constitutional dictatorship.He said, and I quote: You revise the Constitution, give the powers to the president, legislative and executive powers. So in a sense its like a dictatorship because he has powers of two branches, but its constitutional.Panelo, who once ran under Marcos Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan or Movement for a New Society, was right. Just like Marcos said in his book, once authoritarianism is embedded in a Constitution and is seemingly ratified by the people - even by a fake ratification as what happened with the 1973 Constitution, then the dictatorship becomes constitutional.Both the Marcos and Duterte governments allude to the formation of a revolutionary government as a good thing. On page 36, Marcos said that what we see in the Third World, therefore are political revolutions of the experimental kind.Following Marcos example of ruling by decree, Duterte plans to do the same by instituting a revolutionary government where he will have unrestricted powers.Duterte himself has alluded to wanting to form a revolutionary government as early as June 2015, or one and a half years before he ran for president. He said on national TV: I will give myself six months to one year to do the reforms I want to do. If the system becomes obstructionist and I become inutile, I will declare a revolutionary government.""That same month of June 2015, Duterte invited then-Senator Ferdinand Bongbog Marcos Junior as his special guest in his ""Guikan sa Masa"" TV program. In that episode, Bongbong Marcos advised Duterte to amend the Constitution early on during his presidency and not wait.Just like what his father did. The elder Marcos steam-rollered the writing of a new Constitution so much so that in fourth months time, it was put in place after a sham ratification using village assemblies instead of the secret ballot.Echoing Marcos, Duterte in August 2015 told reporters and editors of the Philippine Daily Inquirer that a revolutionary government was the only way to fast-track federalism, stop criminality and fix the government. He bluntly told Inquirer reporters: I wont do it if you want to place me there with the solemn pledge to stick to the rules. If you dont want that, OK, look for another son of a bitch.On October 2015, a year before the filing of the certificate of candidacy for president, online news site Rappler asked Duterte what he intended to do if he ran for president.Duterte replied:Its going to be a dictatorship. Its the police and the military who will be the backbone. If they agree with you - if the right-thinking policemen and military men agree with you - then after six years, there will be a new set-up: maybe a federal type, less corruption, and a fresh air for the next generation.Last week, chief presidential legal counsel Panelo asserted that Dutertes landslide win as president shows that the electorate factored that. You must remember that during the campaign he already said that.. He said do not vote for me. I will have a bloody presidency and I will declare a revolutionary government if all things fail, if the forces against the government will work against it, I will be forced to declare martial  er - a revolutionary government. The electorate factored that. And when he was voted overwhelmingly, the electorate gave him the overwhelming mandate to declare a revolutionary government if there is a need for that.Panelos assertion is a Marcosian way of justifying the imposition of a revolutionary government even without a plebiscite, as provided by law.HUMAN RIGHTSAnother thing that Marcos and Duterte shared is the gross disregard for human rights. Dutertes tension with the United States with regards to human rights was also experienced by Marcos, at least with the Carter administration. Marcos wrote in the same book: I say, too, that I know whereof I speak for the principal issue levelled against my government is that it has been anti-democratic and suppressive of human rights. Hence, the human rights test has been applied in our case.Marcos claimed that part of the reason for Americas undertaking noble crusades in the name of foreign policyis I suspectthat the imposition of constitutional authoritarianism shattered, once and for all, the initial foreign policy crusade, William McKinleys vision of Americas Manifest Destiny to spread the blessings of democracy and education.The Marcos dictatorship had what Dr Alfred McCoy has called a theater of terror - or dead bodies with gunshot wounds or missing parts, dumped overnight on the streets outside Manila.Apparently, Duterte seems to have the same scriptwriter as Marcos but with an added feature - corpses wrapped in garbage bags and packing tape, accompanied with a sign claiming the victim was a drug addict or drug lord and should not be emulated.Marcos called the human rights reports a waste of newsprint but good propaganda. He denied that there were 150,000 political detainees. In the first place, we do not have that kind of space in any place in the Philippines, he said.However, the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines found out that detention centers had been scattered all over the country inside military camps. Marcos in his own devious way, was right. There was no single detention place that housed 150,000.Marcos also justified the arrest of 60,000 men and women when Martial Law was proclaimed. He said these were merely unserved warrants. But he did not say why prominent Philippine senators like Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Jose Diokno as well as over a dozen delegates of the ongoing Constitutional Convention had unserved warrants and for what crimes these were issued.Using the excuse of the threat posed by a vaguely defined class of people, Marcos arrested those he called subversives and communists.Today, with Duterte, its drug criminals, drug lords and destabilizers. He will probably soon include communists and the media.Both the Marcos and Duterte governments also tend to make sweeping generalizations when it comes to the subject of human rights. In 1974 - two years after declaring Martial Law - Marcos asserted that no one but no one has been tortured.Later on, He modified this saying killings do occur but these are isolated cases.HUMAN WRONGSI was taken aback when I heard Duterte utter the following statement on May 17, 2016 after the New York-based Human Rights Watch raised an alarm over the Davao Death Squad. Duterte sarcastically said: If criminals in the book of these foreigners have their human rights, peace-loving citizens should also be entitled to some human wrongs to protect themselves.The phrase human wrongs was so striking and tabloidish that the media picked it up.The phrase rang a bell in my mind.I knew I had read the exact, same phrase human wrongs somewhere among the documents I had used to write my book Marcos Martial Law: Never Again.Sure enough, I found the narrative of 36-year-old Noel Etabags arrest and torture which he had secretly given to the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines.Etabag wrote: I was dragged into another room, and the tactical interrogation began. The man who first approached me said: Dont think that we will not hurt you. We have no human rights here, only human wrong. Carter is no longer President. Its Reagan now. You talk and we will not hurt you. Do you know that we can easily liquidate you now? Nobody knows that we have arrested you. And nobody knows that you were brought here. Then the round-faced man rained powerful blows on my abdomen and ribs. Several others joined in hitting me on the chest, ribs, stomach, arms and shoulders. I was also repeatedly slapped.Like Marcos who denied there was torture going on in his regime, the Duterte government, for its part, has completely denied that extra-judicial killings are taking place. It has also banned the media and the Philippine Senate from obtaining police reports on the deaths under investigation - or killings blamed mostly on those riding-in-tandem. Riding-in-tandems are perpetrated by two men on a motorbike. One drives, the other one shoots the intended target.Three media outfits in Manila - Reuters News Service, Rappler and Vera Files, have been visited separately by police officers demanding to know whether certain journalists - one of them a foreign national - worked with them. The reporters had been asking for copies of police reports on deaths under investigation on Dutertes war on drugs.Both Marcos and Duterte are also using the excuse of the threat posed by a vaguely defined class of people. During Marcos time it was subversives and communists. With Duterte its drug criminals, drug lords and destabilizers. He will probably soon include communists and media men.Marcos justified the imposition of Martial Law by saying, I will not preside over the death of democracy.Duterte is justifying a revolutionary government saying, I have always maintained that my duty, my sacred duty to preserve and defend the Filipino does not emanate from any constitutional restriction.THE LAWLike Marcos, Duterte apparently sees himself as THE LAW.This attitude might have been instilled by the fact that both got away with the law. Marcos was accused of shooting to death his fathers political rival Julio Nalundasan but the judge who wrote the decision let him off because he was too young and too bright to send to jail and death.In Dutertes case, he had shot and wounded a classmate whom he said was bullying and making fun of him. A board of inquiry, set up to investigate the incident and mete the punishment, merely gave Duterte a slap on the wrist. It allowed him to graduate but not march during the rites, former Senator Rene Saguisag said. Saguisag, who was part of the inquiry, told me that he had voted to expel Duterte for what he did but he was outvoted.Saguisag claimed this incident could have given Duterte the attitude that he could get away with anything [and] thats whats happening now. Thousands are being killed in his war on drugs.Still, Saguisag maintained that Duterte could still change.Duterte, like Marcos, knows how to manipulate the law for his own ends. Duterte has talked about fabricating evidence while he was a prosecutor in Davao City. He said, we planted evidence. We arrested persons but we released them.Little else is known about Duterte as a lawyer or a prosecutor. However, a retired military general whom I talked to on three separate occasions told me some more about Duterte.According to General Ramon Montano, former head of the Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police which later became the Philippine National Police, Duterte was the state prosecutor in Davao City, southern Philippines. He was the state prosecutor. So all our cases he prosecutes, Montano told me.Montano described Duterte then as a protector of the police who was assigned there in Davao. Montano told me that all the graft and corruption, drugs (cases), he was the one who prosecuted them, and of course he defended them.By way of background, I first interviewed General Montano back in 2016 for my book Marcos Martial Law because after Marcos Martial Law, he was the only general who spoke out against the torture and human rights abuses.I also knew that the 80-year-old Montao would not mince words.He was also uniquely placed since he is a die-hard Duterte supporter and was a senior military officer during Marcos Martial Law. Montao was once Marcos chief of the militarys Philippine Constabulary anti-narcotics unit, and was once even given a financial sideline by Imelda Marcos. He told me he was given the janitorial services contract for Philippine Plaza Hotel.And yet, he was the first and lone military general to write against the massive human rights abuses by the military during Marcos martial law.In a book he co-authored on the history of the Philippine Constabulary, Montao wrote: While martial law allowed the constabulary to flex its muscles and battle rebels and criminals who stood in the way of peace and order, it was sadly an occasion too, for unspeakable abuse as a number of them succumbed to the intoxicating effects of power.He lamented that Marcos had turned the countrys erstwhile democracy into a system where star chamber methods were reportedly used to literally torture evidence into existence, and to instill fear among the fainthearted.During Corazon Aquinos presidency, while he was head of the command guarding the nations capital, Montao abruptly resigned after a farmers rally in Mendiola outside Malacanang Palace resulted in 13 deaths. He went on to hunt down coup leaders against Mrs. Aquino.Later, though, when his former PC boss Fidel Ramos became President, he was promoted to head of the Philippine Constabulary- Integrated National Police which replaced the Philippine Constabulary from 1988 to 1990..Given all these, he is uniquely positioned to comment.He recalled that during the height of communist insurgency in Davao City, Duterte was the mayor.Montao told me that he once removed the bodyguards from then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte. I asked him why. He replied it was because Duterte was using the bodyguards to kill people.The bodyguards are with him and he used them to terrorize or kill, Montao said.He recalled laughing that after Dutertes bodyguards were removed, Duterte quickly scooted to Manila to have them reinstated because he was afraid.Montao said: Our creation is Duterte. He made himself a champion. He was backed up by Commander Parago (of the communist New Peoples Army).The retired general then described Duterte as brave only when the enemy is in handcuffs.Duterte himself acknowledged his close ties with the communist rebels in his area during a forum at the APEC Summit held in Manila in October 2015. He said he had allowed the rebels to extort provided they did not ask for much from the various corporations in the area.MARCOS FAMILY AND DUTERTEHow can Duterte, with no training in national government, win the top post?Aside from instilling fear regarding crime among voters, dropping so many promises and having a vast army of vicious online trolls patrolling the social media sites, I believe that Duterte also had a hidden ace up his sleeve. He had the political backing of three former Philippine presidents - Fidel Ramos, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Joseph Estrada plus the Marcos family.Ramos apparently saw himself as a kingmaker. Arroyo and Estrada had unspoken favors. Arroyo wanted to be released from jail. Estrada also wanted his son Jinggoy released.The Marcoses had previously backed Estrada when he ran for president in 1998. When he won, Imee Marcos rapturously said they we are over the moon.Many professionals were appointed by my father. So you have this immense bedrock of Marcos appointees who keep moving up. Among those were Dutertes father and Duterte himself. In 1972, Duterte was appointed to the city prosecutors office despite the fact that he had shot a classmate.Later, Duterte disclosed that the Marcoses had helped him a lot. In truth and in fact, the Marcos family helped make the Duterte presidency happen.In any case, Dutertes presidential inauguration was the very first time after fleeing in 1986 that the two siblings, Imee and Bongbong Marcos, set foot in Malacanang as guests of honor.One of the first presidential acts of Duterte was to bury his idol, the dictator, a hero and to start negotiations with the Marcos family for the return of some assets.To many of those with no memory of Marcos Martial Law, it was no big deal.And there were many. By 2010, more than half of Filipino voters were born after 1986 when the Marcoses fled. There was no extensive book written on that period. In fact, the only Philippine history used as a college textbook stopped with 1972 before the declaration of Martial Law.Meanwhile, to fill the gap in history, the Marcoses were quietly building up support in social media and revising history, projecting the dictator as the greatest president and Martial Law as THE golden age of Philippines politics.They were making the ground fertile for another strongman rule.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: Human rights in PH: How the Marcos dictatorship made Duterte happen

Jonathan Ernst, ReutersMANILA- Maintaining peace in Southeast Asia is the main driving factor of the annual meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), an analyst said Monday.Karim Raslan, a Southeast Asian commentator and columnist, said annual meetings of ASEAN leaders are important even though there are disagreements between countries.""How can we all work together so easily? We have to go to a common denominator which is basically keeping the peace, building prosperity upon that,"" he said in an interview on ANC's Headstart.Raslan explains that despite criticism over ASEAN's principle of non-interference, it is still better for countries to engage in talks instead of using military force to settle disputes.""The important thing is just to keep together no matter how much we disagree...better to talk than to go to war,"" he said.He added that it is better to have a ""boring"" ASEAN Summit, since it means that peace prevails over the region.FRAMEWORK FOR OVERSEAS WORKERSWith the Philippines' hosting of this year's ASEAN Summit, Raslan said it would probably be a good move for Manila to propose creating a multilateral framework for overseas foreign workers within the region since it is supposedly a ""Filipino core agenda.""Raslan said, given the millions of undocumented Southeast Asians staying in different countries within the region, the Philippines could initiate talks on the subject since thousands of Filipinos are also scattered across the region.""There is no multilateral framework for overseas foreign workers within ASEAN... These (overseas workers) are the people that we should be addressing if we're talking about inclusive growth, so why don't we do something there? And that's totally within our power,"" he said.ASEAN leaders are currently in Manila for the 31st summit of the regional bloc. Also in the Philippines are United States President Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.","Maintaining peace keeps ASEAN together, says analyst"

Reuters Malcolm Turnbull looks like he could use a nap, after he was caught yawning during a gala dinner at the ASEAN summit. Nine NewsAfter a while, you just give up and go with the flow...even Rodrigo Dirty Harry Duterte has had to behave in the face of ASEAN's endless, sleep-inducing meetings.Just over a year ago, I came up with the idea of relaunching my column  the one you're reading now  as Ceritalah ASEAN (or ""Tell Me a Story, ASEAN"").The concept  meeting and interviewing ordinary people from across this region of 650 million  seemed really exciting.However, as I got to work hitting the ground, listening to farmers, migrant workers, tourist guides, day-labourers and school teachers from Bassein, to Nam Dinh, Manado and Bacolod, I began to realize that I'd made a little mistake.Southeast Asia is vibrant, sexy and alive.ASEANas a supranational organizationis turgid, pompous and comatose at best.Essentially, ASEAN is the antithesis to everything that makes Southeast Asia interesting.Its streets are raucous. Its unpredictable.By comparison, ASEAN is elitist. Its most comfortable in luxury hotels, resorts and convention centres. Its meetings are well-choregraphed talk-fests.So, while I'm still deeply fascinated, indeed in love with our region, its people and their stories, I find it extremely difficult to muster much enthusiasm for rooms full of bureaucrats.I still think Southeast Asias huge, growing economy (which in 2013 had a combined GDP of USD2.4 trillion)  destined to be the fourth-largest in the world by 2050 according to McKinsey  has boundless potential.But I gotta be honest: ASEAN has no poetry.Zero. Zilch.Theres no shared emotional connection  unless you can count durian-eating as a form of bonding.Even our so-called disagreements  mostly over the South China Sea  have become predictable as Chinas geopolitical and economic influence in our region grows.Indeed, I would recommend any book (and a great many columns) on ASEAN as a sure-fire cure for insomnia.More seriously: ASEAN has not really helped to provide the infrastructure as well as jobs that many of its 650 million people desperately need. That task is still very much on the shoulders of individual nation states.And it has done even less to protect the most vulnerable of that 650 million (several of whom I encountered via this column) from abuse, exploitation and impunity  particularly the regions migrant workers.Again, zero.This is why I can't conjure up any excitement for the upcoming gathering in Manila  even though its the 50th anniversary and Trump is apparently staying for the whole event.Yawn.Given what snore-fests these ASEAN meetings are  one has a feeling he will regret even showing up at all.Quite frankly  it really doesnt matter, in the grand scheme of things, whether hes there or not.Foreign policy pundits will argue that his attendance is to reassure the region that America isnt retreating from the Asia-Pacific/the World  but is this really the case?The barometer of American (and for that matter, Chinese) power and influence in the region  is hardly dependent on whether its leaders attend a boring round of speeches as well as an awkward family photo in the host nations traditional garb.People cry but its the optics.Trust me: this is one case where optics really, really does not matter  at least in the long run.Perhaps its time we stop believing that our regions peace, prosperity and reputation is at stake at every Summit.But maybe I am being too hard on ASEAN.It did, after all, achieve its purpose of keeping Southeast Asia relatively peaceful and neutral in the decades since its formation via the 1967 Bangkok Declaration.And maybe boring IS good  at least with regards to ASEAN's diplomatic agenda?When the grouping was first conceived in the height of the Cold War, Southeast Asia was a cauldron with distrust, suspicion and outright violence at every corner  from Vietnam to Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia.ASEAN provided a neutral platform to bring states together, to build trust and familiarity.It's been a long, arduous process with, arguably, the normalization of Indonesia and the Indochinese states at the core of its agenda.The sheer, grinding tedium and rigidity of the ASEAN process  the communiques and set-piece speechesexhausts all our leaders to such an extent that they often dont have the energy or interest to scheme and plot against one another.Instead, all they want to do is escape.And maybe, just maybe: that should be enough for us in the region?We can and certainly should focus on building business-to-business, media-to-media and people-to-people ties regardless of what happens in ASEAN.Regional integrationespecially in Southeast Asiamust be driven from the ground-up.So Donald, don't even try to be too clever.ASEAN is structured and crafted to defeat and subsume grand-standing and point-scoring.Grab a durian and head for the corner seat.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",OPINION: When boring is good: ASEAN at 50
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"On 11 November, leaders from 21 nations - including US President Donald Trump (who fancies himself as a builder), Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping - will descend upon the city of Danang, Central Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting.The 21 leaders will land at Danang International Airport, cross the iconic Han River Bridge (the symbol of the coastal city), pass by the 37-storey Danang Administration Centre (the tallest building in the province) and reach the Intercontinental Resort where the summit will be held.Nguyen Ba Thanh, leader of Danang from 1997-2013. TuoiTre News Nguyen was a popular leader, regularly thronged by crowds wherever he went. PetroVietnam Tran Thi Ly Bridge, designed to appear like a sail. Danang is known for its beautiful bridges. Karim Raslan The Dragon Bridge, an icon of the city. On the weekend evenings, the dragons head breathes fire. Karim Raslan The Danang skyline, marked by the 37 storey Danang Administration Centre. Karim Raslan Fishing boats dot the Danang riverway. Karim Raslan The roads of Danang are wide and spacious. The city benefited from a massive infrastructure push under Nguyen Ba Thanh. Karim RaslanDanangs astounding progress is the work of one remarkable man: the late Nguyen Ba Thanh - who served as Danangs leader from 1997 to 2013 (he was also the citys Communist party head).And the numbers underline Nguyen's successes. From 1997 to 2008, the citys economy grew at an average of 11.26%, well above the national average of 7.06%. In 1997, its per capita income was VND4.69 million but by 2008 had more than quadrupled to VND23.62 million.In the same period, households below the poverty line also dropped from 8.79% to less than 1%, so much so that Da Nang is now being promoted as a model city and a great triumph of Vietnamese ingenuity and dynamism.Charming, determined and results-orientated, Nguyen presided over much of this economic metamorphosis.Hoang (all names have been changed), a 68-year-old trader living in the Khue My district of Danang had a personal brush with the leader. In 2001, his farm was marked for redevelopment and his family resettled. Nguyen personally came to his house to persuade the residents to move.He explained why we had to move, why our land, which was next to the river, was important for the development of the city. He was friendly, kind, and he made sure to speak to all of the 100 residents, even if it was for a short while.He was eloquent, caring, and funny! After speaking to him, I was happy to move.During his time, the roads became bigger, the streets became cleaner and Danang became a city I am proud of.Hoang was part of a large group of farmers who were displaced to make way for riverside developments. While many of them lost their land, they were compensated and the state helped them find affordable housing.Ngoc, now a banh mi (Vietnam's distinctive baguette sandwich) hawker, is another one of these former farmers. According to her, Nguyen also visited her housing area to engage the community: He was close to the peopleHe spoke like one of us, like a local.Nguyen was a Danang man, born in the citys Hoa Vang district. By all accounts, he was a charismatic figure who was as comfortable in a village hall as he was in a hotel conference room.The King of Danang as some called him, was popular with rich and poor alike.Pham, a 49-year-old businessman, is one of them. His parents came from Danangs poverty-stricken inner city and were beneficiaries of Nguyens affordable housing plans.During Tet (the Vietnamese New Year), he would give out rice and provisions to the poor. He built affordable homes. He also established a homeless shelter in Danang. Look around! Compare this to Ho Chi Minh City. Do you see any beggars?Nguyen Ba Thanh was special. I dont think there has been a leader as well-loved as him since Uncle Ho (Ho Chi Minh).Danangs rapid development was made possible by power. Nguyen (aka ""The King"") was known to have an iron grip on Danangs Peoples Committee, ruling with a paternalistic, firm hand.As Dinh, who has worked in Danang for the past 20 years noted: He was strict with his civil servants  very involved with day-to-day affairs, he even chose the theme song for Danang.It used to be that when you needed a building license for a house, you had to go to three or four different departments for permits. Nguyen Ba Thanh streamlined the process and now you not only just need to go to one department, they even give you a deadline for delivery. And they actually deliver on time!Take for example the Danang Administration Centre. In the past, the different departments were located all over the city. It made internal coordination very difficult and applying for licenses a hassle. Now, all of them are in that tower.In 2000, Nguyen was investigated for graft over the construction of the Han River Bridge. Around the same time, he was also accused of violating legal procedures while conducting a relocation operation.To Dinh however: Both of those cases came to nothing. The people of Danang know that he was toughBut he delivered results. For most of us, thats all that matters.All over Vietnam, people knew him. People would say to me: I wish my city had someone like Nguyen Ba Thanh.In many ways Nguyen  a ground-up, transformational leader  has more in common with the Presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines, Joko Widodo and Rodrigo Duterte, respectively. All three revived their home cities and eventually moved to the centre.However, in the case of Nguyen, the story wasn't to end with him securing power at the national level.Instead, after leaving Danang in 2013 and becoming the Communist Partys anti-corruption tsar, his star faded as did his health, succumbing to cancer in early 2015.His untimely and tragic death at the age of 62 was mourned by millions, who had hoped that he would have been able to transform the rest of the country as he did Danang. But we  and Vietnam  shall never know if he had it in him.When he died, I cried, lamented Hoang. The last time I cried over a leader was when General Vo Nguyen Giap (a Vietnam War hero) passed.This week, as hundreds of sleek black Audis chauffeur world leaders to APEC, they will be traveling on the roads and bridges built by Nguyen, in the city that was his throne. The shadow of the King of Danang still looms large.","As APEC convenes, a Vietnamese leaders legacy lives on"

Photo by Arlene Burgos, ABS-CBN News""All of the elements and the poverty level... although it has been decreasing in the past years, but still it is high. All of these ingredients are present and ripe for a terrorist organization like the ones who are in Syria to actually come in and take advantage of the situation. All they have to do is bring money. It is not purely ideological,"" Alamia said.Alamia was referring to ties reported between extremist elements in the southern Philippines, and in southeast Asia, who have allegedly been inspired by or were responding to calls from the Islamic State or ISIS.Pictures of Maute Group members and other suspected extremists were scattered around Cotabato City and the ARMM after the Marawi siege. Photo by Arlene Burgos, ABS-CBN NewsViolent extremism recruitment in the southern Philippines has seen southeast Asian fighters traveling there. These fighters have also traveled to southern Thailand, and to Rakhine in Myanmar. This has been worrying Malaysia and Indonesia, an academic said last month, echoing US officials' information that ISIS recruitment for fighters in the Philippines continues.Indonesian and Malaysian fighters were in Marawi, local security officials have been saying. After the fall of Marawi siege masterminds, the military said they chased a Malaysian terrorist, Mahmud bin Ahmad, who possibly funded the siege of the city.On Thursday, President Rodrigo Duterte said Ahmad was killed.A MATTER OF LIVELIHOODRadicalization used to be a matter of livelihood for the young recruits of violent extremism, Alamia said, as they ""get a lot of money"" by joining.""Some of those who were arrested from other areas in the ARMM, like in Maguindanao, in Zamboanga City, in Zamboanga del Sur, the Armed Forces and the Philippine National Police were able to arrest some young men who were going to, who were headed to Marawi. They said they were paid this amount, and they were promised this particular amount, it's huge, and that they will be trained in Lanao del Sur to fight the ISIS,"" she said.The recruits did not know that they would be brought to Marawi to be with the ISIS-inspired groups and were fooled into believing that they would be earning much.""Most of them, and sadly it's [joining extremists] because of lack of opportunities, lack of education also. Because they are poor, because their level of understanding and education is very low, so they are easily fooled by these groups who are in it for the money,"" Alamia said.ARMM is home to about 3.8 million Filipinos (2015 census), more than half of whom are poor. Those with basic reading and writing skills constituted 86.1 percent of the population, lower than the national average of 96.5 percent. There were 86 government doctors, or one doctor for every 40,867 individuals, double the ideal doctor-to-20,000-individual-ratio.But it is not just poverty driving people to extremism. Some get recruited out of frustration. Alamia cited the case of the Maute clan members harboring grievances, then recruiting.The Maute brothers Omar and Abdullah, along with the Abu Sayyafs Isnilon Hapilon, were believed to have hatched the Marawi City siege. They were killed in the Philippine forces five-month campaign to regain control of the city.""The ones that they (Mautes) have recruited, we have information that some of them were children of former MILF [Moro Islamic Liberation Front] members, combatants or commanders. And they used money. I think that's a primary force that attracts them. Its the money.""That orphaned families of former fighters would pick up the cause as revenge resurfaced recently with the deaths of Maute and Hapilon. Experts warned about retaliation, especially from their kin.The battle for the youth's attention has been a contest on narratives, too.Amir Mawallil, director of the Office on Bangsamoro Youth Affairs in ARMM, said his office has been trying to provide counter-narratives.Amir Mawallil, director of the Office on Bangsamoro Youth Affairs in ARMM, reaches out to the youth in a battle against violent extremism. Photo by Arlene Burgos, ABS-CBN News""We try to convince more young people to go back to the discussion on the peace process because one of the reasons we feel is there are frustrations on the part of these young people on how the government approaches the peace process. What we try to make them realize is to tell them that this is the legitimate struggle that we should be pursuing and not the radical one,"" Mawallil said, in reference to the national peace effort.Pending in Congress is a proposed law creating a new autonomous Bangsamoro region in the southern Philippines. The new region is among the structural cures eyed by government and former Moro separatists to ensure delivery of basic social service to areas that will constitute the new homeland.The Defense department and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process both recognize the need to curtail avenues for violent extremism recruitment among the youth.''It's not about the physical reconstruction of Marawi but it's on the psycho-social effect on the people of Marawi; how these people will accept what happened to them, what's happening to them now, and what will happen in the future. So our focus now is on preventing, especially the youth, in trying to understand what's the real reason why they are suffering these days,'' said Undersecretary for Defense Operations Cesar Yano, who is concurrently executive director of the Task Force Bangon Marawi. He made this statement to foreign journalists September 18, a full month before President Duterte's declaration of Marawi's liberation.Yano said the government is counting on Muslim religious leaders in enlightening their flock about what happened in Marawi.''That is highly considered by the Philippine government, engaging their religious leaders as well as their traditional leaders... They resolve problems among themselves through their traditional leaders. But we also have the local government leaders who are elected by the people,"" Yano said.On the part of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, Undersecretary Diosita Andot said they been reaching out to Bangsamoro youth so that they can ""influence their counterparts from other parts of the area"" and convince them against involvement with radical or extremist ideologies.""For instance, we have the youth organizing themselves to put up a small economic project in their communities to generate livelihood and employment because we see that one of the reasons why the youth are attracted as well to this new ideology is because they don't have anything else to do in communities that are really isolated and where government services are hard to reach,"" Andot said.As in the case of the ARMM, the OPAPP has gotten wind of local terrorist groups paying young recruits salaries.""They are also given support for their families. For a poor family, for a young man or woman who do not have job or have not been educated, this is a very attractive option for them,"" Andot said.Yet these efforts may still be far-off from the culture- or education-based projects of other countries that have focused on reining in violent extremism indoctrination and recruitment in schools, community centers, or even in correctional facilities.(Editor's note: The author was a participant of the East-West Center's 2017 Senior Journalists' Program held in the United States, the Philippines, and Morocco.)","'Money, frustration, ideology attracting youth to violent extremism in PH'"
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"The political landscape of the Philippines has shown us that those who dare to transition into politics can make it, if only in name. Many popular personalities have dared to run in an election and have won government positions. Many activists, athletes, and even actors (especially actors) have tried and succeeded in earning a seat in government, regardless of actual knowledge or experience in public service.Quite predictably, not all of them have managed a successful transition into being genuine public servants and having a voice that is truly representative of the people.Rep. Sitti Djalia Turabin-Hataman is one of the few who have succeeded in making this transition, way beyond title and position.Cong. Dadah, as she is called by those whom she works with, didnt start her professional life by seeking out a career in politics. She was once a college student taking up biology in the Western Mindanao State University, and then became a law student who found herself elected as an officer of the Moro Human Rights Center, a non-governmental organization that conducts human rights workshops and monitors human rights violations in Mindanao.She would soon start her own non-governmental organization called Pinay Kilos or PINK, a womens organization that focused on empowering women in the island provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-tawi. It spearheaded workshops specifically tailored for women, with a range of topics that involved gender issues and womens rights. It prided itself in being an organization that believed in the potential of fullness in every woman and the importance of women inside and outside the home.Her career in government began in 2010, when she was appointed executive director of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos. Three years later, she was chosen by Anak Mindanao (AMIN), to be the partylists first nominee in the 2013 elections.The rest, as they say, is history.During her time in Congress, she consistently represented the Bangsamoro people by pushing for legislation that clearly respond to needs that are specific to the Bangsamoro, without compromising response to the needs of the Filipino people as well. She has pushed for the establishment of women and child friendly spaces in evacuation centers; the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, and other status; and the promotion of positive discipline of children.She has also constantly stood for human rights, especially the rights of women as she constantly raised awareness about the meaning of the hijab, ensured the safety and welfare of women in conflict-affected areas, and was a vocal advocate of the Reproductive Health Law.As a Bangsamoro woman, she was also at the forefront of asserting her peoples right to self-determination by being an avid but critical supporter of the peace process. Her most recent contribution is in her participation as a co-author in drafting of the House of Representatives newest version of the Bangsamoro Basic Law.On October 2, 2017, she bid her Congress seat farewell as she delivered a heartfelt speech about how her heart has longed to be back home.Home, to Cong. Dadah, is a place where she can speak and be heard, not as a person of influence and power but simply as herself. It is a place where she is spoken to without the barrier of a title or a position, but just as herself.She left Congress, not so she can be silent, but so she can speak as she always has, in the hopes of magnifying the voice of the Bangsamoro people.To Cong. Dadah, leaving Congress means coming home to a place where she can be truly of service to the Bangsamoro. But, to the Bangsamoro people, Cong. Dada has never left that home that she speaks of.Through the years, her office and her title may have changed in a number of ways, but her heart and her voice has remained the same. She has always been with the Bangsamoro people and, if there is anything we have learned from her years in public service, its that her place in our hearts and the region we all call home will never change.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.","OPINION: Rep.

It is so very difficult, the kind of difficult where it seems like every last effort ends in having to endure some more. It is exhausting to endure. Yet endure we must, and burnout is a bogeyman we could fall prey to if we let ourselves do soand it is so tempting when we see the suffering in Marawi.It drains ones energy, getting used to counting dead Filipinos day in and day outtoo many of them Morosamong the mess of cadavers left by the ongoing battle to oust ISIS-inspired terrorists out of Marawi City. The lassitude we are left with in the aftermath of this grim math called a body count is almost paralytic. We must do more than just count bodies: Moros must bury their dead even as the lives they built are razed to the groundcommunities, homes, what small livelihoods theyd grown.This is the unimaginable grief of the residents of Marawi, the Philippines only Muslim city. Even these stark words are insufficient for describing the experience of being a resident of that city, a citizen of this country where a city can be leveled in four months of steady warfare that has yet to end. All of the civilians in this city have been displaced, and yet the battle continues even as I write this piece. We Moros, and the Maranaos who call Marawi home, are people of peace bludgeoned with a steady stream of warfare, caught in the crossfire between the Maute group and the military.We must explain these things to the children who witness themthe ones who yet live and will survive this horror. They have watched their homes get battered by fusillades of artillery and aerial bombing runs.Yet even as we struggle to explain this to the kids, we struggle with our own questions. Why does it look so easy to reduce all we have workednay, struggled, foughtto build, holding on to the faith that we Moros can someday live in peace to just how many have died and been displaced?The Philippines only Muslim city burns and has been burning for four months, all in the name of purging the country of terrorists who call themselves Muslim. The battle has grown protracted and, with each day that passes, the burden on the shoulders of Marawis people weighs interminably more. Daily we are told to hold out just a little more, that the conflict nears its end. But so, I fear, does our endurance. Maybe Allah will refresh our flagging endurance, and if He does, then we go on faith again, as we did before. As we always did.It is exhausting to watch a city decimated with savage violence because it is a Muslim city where terrorists roosted, cussed in their resistance.It drains body and soul to face down and fight discrimination each blessed day simply because the name you carry, the name that identifies your person, is undeniably Muslim.We have a crisis on our hands and, even with all the help, the best solution is an end to the fighting and immediate efforts to rebuild what was destroyedat least we can rebuild the physical structures and the businesses, if not the lives lost, the lives irrevocably changed.I feel a weariness to my bones, that deep ache of exhaustion over being Filipino, over being a Filipino Moro. I see Filipino children and youths living in the nightmare that is Marawi today, beneath bombs and bullets. My endurance is pushed to the limit simply by being a Moro in the Philippines, simply by being a Filipino, and this prayer leaves my lips: Mercy, Allah, may your mercy touch us as we endure what must be endured to survive. We submit ourselves to Your will, for You are great.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.","OPINION: Let us continue to pray for Marawi, for peace"

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15443,12,209,3152,20,"Last year, Fatrick Tabada wrote ""Patay Na Si Jesus,"" a hilarious movie about a woman who goes on a road trip with her children to visit the wake of her long-estranged husband. This year, Tabada wrote and co-directed (with Rae Red of ""Birdshot"") yet another road-trip movie, ""Si Chedeng at si Apple,"" about a woman who journeys with her best friend to find an old love she left behind many years ago to get married to someone else.Mercedes ""Chedeng"" Suarez is a 66-year old retired school principal and mother of three adult boys. She now spends her days taking care of her invalid husband, Francisco. When her husband passes away one morning, she surprises her whole family during his cremation by announcing that she is a lesbian.Chedeng's best friend is Apolinaria ""Apple"" Macaraeg. She is a 63-year old woman who has been living in with a violently abusive man named Doriteo Gomez. One day, after being severely beaten up and burned, Apple kills him. Chedeng goes to help Apple clean up the mess and dispose of the body (except for two vital parts).The two women then boards a ship bound to Cebu, each for their own reasons. Apple needs to get away from the major crime she just committed. Chedeng needes to go search for and reconnect with a certain Lydia Cantilla, an old girlfriend who has ""talented fingers."" Neither us going to be an easy task for the two old ladies.Comparisons of ""Chedeng at Apple"" with ""Patay Na Si Hesus"" are inevitable because its publicity reminded us that both were written by the same writer. Despite the dark comedy approach employed in both films, the farce of ""Patay"" felt more carefree and relaxed, more good-natured. In ""Chedeng,"" the comedy involved getting away with murder. Hence, there are deeper shades of dark here, for which humor may come across as forced or contrived. But thanks to the earnest performances of the lead cast, the whole project still comes across as generally perky and delightful.Chedeng and Apple are both such offbeat roles for the two veteran leads actresses Gloria Diaz and Elizabeth Oropesa, respectively. I don't think I remember the always refined and elegant Ms. Diaz tackle such a role that would make her say such outrageous crass lines, such as that one about a certain type of hair on her body. La Oropesa got to do a lot of wacky and disgusting physical comedy scenes. The comic timing of these two ladies were as on point as their undoubted dramatic prowess was in their serous scenes.Venerable stage actors Dido de la Paz (as Francisco) and Teroy Guzman (as Dori) were on screen for a very short time as the soon-dead husbands. Chedeng's three sons were played Ian Lomongo (as the lawyer Rannie), Mike Liwag (as the problematic Romy) and Anthony Falcon (as the gay Rico), but we knew little about their relationship with their mother. Playing a more prominent featured role was Jay Gonzaga, as Adam, a journalist the two ladies met in Cebu. The funny purpose of Tabada for calling this character Adam will be quite evident before he exits the scene.Sheenly Gener also only had a few scenes as Monique, the inhaler-sniffing, Louis Vuitton-loving daughter of Dori, but these were just so hilariously memorable because of her jaded line delivery and that bored deadpan expression she had on her face. That scene when she disgustedly pushed the plastic bag with a severed body appendage the policeman was holding near her face was so funny. Mae Paner also had a marked episode as a butch lesbian who called on our two ladies after Chedeng went on a public service radio show to announce that she was looking for Lydia.There are certain story elements which were explained unsatisfactorily (like why Apple had to bring the head along, why the maid was not interrogated) or too conveniently easy (like how the head in the bag got through port security, how Chedeng hatched the plan to spring Apple out of captivity). The ending seemed rushed and uncertain in execution as well. But anyhow, the winning goodwill of Diaz and Oropesa as the senior-citizen Filipino version of ""Thelma and Louise"" carried the film through in a most entertaining fashion. 7/10This review was originally published in the author's blog, ""Fred Said.""","C1 Originals review: Diaz, Oropesa take offbeat path in 'Chedeng at Apple'"

I think that somewhat reflects the temperature of China-Philippine relations which is also going pretty high,"" Li said on Wednesday, November 15, through a translator.He hopes the two countries will ""strengthen this positive momentum"" to ""make up for the time we might have lost.""Li's metaphor aptly took off from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's own remarks in his state visit to Beijing roughly a year ago, in October 2016.Back then, Duterte used China's seasons to describe the new phase of Philippine-China ties.""Even as we arrived in Beijing close to winter, this is a springtime of our relationship,"" he had said in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping.On Wednesday, Li described that Beijing visit as an ""icebreaking"" trip.Li said the renewed friendship has already led to concrete gains for the Philippines. In the last 10 months, for instance, he said China has become the Philippines' ""top trading partner.""He also cited China's importation of ""13,000 batches of tropical fruits"" from the Southeast Asian country and the 14 new flights between the two countries.Li expects Chinese tourists to make ""some one million trips"" to the Philippines by the end of the year.Duterte to 'reciprocate'During the Chinese leader's visit to Malacaang, he and Duterte witnessed the signing of 14 deals, including a P1.1-billion grant for the rehabilitation of war-torn Marawi City.They also launched the Binondo-Intramuros and Estrella-Pantaleon Bridges Project and Mindanao Drug Rehabilitation Center, funded by a grant from China.Duterte was effusive in his thanks during their expanded bilateral meeting, even saying he hopes to one day ""reciprocate"" China's generosity.Duterte said: ""We are not really in parity as yours. But maybe in the years to come the Filipinos will reciprocate what you have done for us.""He said he owed China a ""debt of gratitude.""""At this time, we cannot offer you anything because we are the ones needing help. But maybe in the future, Philippines would also show its debt of gratitude to China,"" said Duterte.As expected, no mention of the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) dispute or the Hague ruling won by Manila against Beijing was mentioned in their public statements.But Li alluded to them when he spoke of the ""ups and downs"" in their countries' relationship.""Due to well-known reasons for some period of time, there were much doubts expressed by international media outlets as to whether the friendship between our two countries would be able to consolidate and even last,"" said Li.He added that it's high time their two nations ""tell our own stories.""Li expressed China's wish for the heightened cooperation between Beijing and Manila to last even beyond Duterte's 6-year term, which ends in 2022.""My suggestion is that our two sides may sit down together to discuss and formulate cooperation plans in these areas, lasting for the next 5 or even to 10 years,"" said the Chinese Premier.Li is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the Philippines during the Duterte administration.

They, along with a separate independent minority bloc composed of lawmakers from progressive groups, constitute the House opposition.The opposition, in particular, criticized the regional blocs silence on human rights issues  violence against the Rohingya Myanmar and the killing linked to Dutertes bloody drug war in the Philippines.ASEAN chose to ignore its socio political mandates of promoting Human Rights, said Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a board member of the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights. (READ: ASEAN leaders sign commitment protecting migrant workers)State leaders have adopted a sort of diplomatic silence on the human rights abuse and EJKs under Duterte's war on drugs considering that Duterte becomes sensitive when that issue is brought up, observed Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano. (READ: The Deafening Silence of ASEAN on Human Rights Violations)Alejano, however, thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and to some extent, United States President Donald Trump for at least mentioning Dutertes drug war in formal bilateral meetings, statements, or chance conversations on the sidelines of the summit.Villarin said the over P15 billion spent to host the ASEAN was seemingly wasted. He criticized the ASEAN way of ignoring human rights and other contentious issues such as territorial claims against global power house China. Although China is not a member of ASEAN, it joins the gathering during the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN-China Summit, to name a few.Chinese Premiere Li Keqiang attended the summits in Manila.Sovereignty issues like our claims over the WPS are swept under the rug so as not to antagonize a bully in the region, China, from which we want to get an economic bonanza, said Villarin. It was during the ASEAN-China summit that leaders agreed to beginning talks on a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.Duterte himself said the summit exhausted him. As ASEAN chair, he opened almost all of the summits during the event. On the sidelines, he also held bilateral meetings with other countries.

It earned her various accolades, including being recognized by Ernst & Young as Woman Entrepreneur of the Year-Philippines in 2011.Fast forward to 2017, gender disparity is less of an issue to Agudo and her peers.HARI and the entire industry are facing disruptive technologies that will likely erode the double-digit growth in vehicle sales in the Philippines that players have been enjoying in the past years.The continued demand for the services of ride-sharing firms, like Grab and Uber, and other potential innovative alternatives to consumer mobility, such as driverless cars and flying taxis, will shift market positions of current players, Agudo shared.By 2030, the evolution of the industry  not whether one is male or female  will decide who will be the losers and winners.

This was driven by lower revenues, lower proceeds from insurance claims, and a premium paid for the early redemption of the company's US dollar-denominated bonds.But this, EDC noted, was partly offset by lower foreign exchange losses and cheaper financing costs for the period.Earthquake's effectsEDC attributed the drop to the effect that July's magnitude 6.5 earthquake had on the firm's Leyte unit, its largest. At the time the earthquake hit, EDC said its Leyte unit was producing 540 megawatts (MW) of electricity but it had to be stopped.The firm has since brought back to service all of its major units, save for two 60-MW units in its Mahanagdong geothermal plant.

However, not all ideas can stand out. (READ: Standout solutions: The winning ideas from #HackSociety 2017 )In the Philippines, a study shows there are already 164,473 social enterprises contributing to poverty alleviation. These innovative social enterprises have been trying to solve different problems.During the ASEAN + Social Good Summit held at the Rappler HQ on Monday, November 13, various experts and social entrepreneurs discussed different insights on how to make a social enterprise idea thrive.According to Percival Cendea, a former commissioner at the National Youth Commission, what makes millennials move forward with their ideas is their pasaway mindset.""In Filipino, we have this term called pasaway which can be translated into English as being unruly or the refusal to follow rules. You can't just give millennials a problem and say there are no solutions. They will always find answers to the solution,"" Cendea said.He added that a good thing about millennials today is that they don't stop seeking and coming up with bold and crazy solutions for the problems that the elders might have given up on.Two of the panelists during the discussion served as perfect examples.Cristina Guanzon and Pauline Guanzon are sisters who founded E.A.R.S by Innovable, Incorporated.E.A.R.S. stands for Early Action Response System, which offers a wearable device for the deaf. It has a sensor and vibration system that can serve as a safety assistant for the deaf in public places.Born with a disability, Cristina chose to seek solutions that can help her. She did not let her disability define what she can and cannot do.Pauline said that it was the disability that served as the greatest motivation for her sister to innovate.""People with disabilities are not less of a person. They just have different strengths and abilities. [Christina] wanted to prove that she is not just this, she can do so much more,"" Pauline added.Katrina Chan, Executive Director of QBO Innovation Hub, also shared what talents they look for in millennials today.""There are so many ideas and innovations out there but it's really the entrepreneurs that understand the problem, validate with their customers, and execute solutions that enjoy success and make an impact,"" she said.TipsJust like any other startups, aspiring social entrepreneurs must be aware of the inevitable challenges they will face as they turn their ideas into actions.Pauline Guanzon shared one important tip in times of trying times. ""Stand firm on your why because your who and how might change,"" she said.She added that there might people who will bring you down but what is important is that you find the right people to work with.Another tip would be to check the replicability of the idea or solution. ""How do you develop a franchise for a certain idea? Try to imagine your program in a different place. If it works, then it is a better idea. Imagination and collaboration will play a big role,"" Cendea shared.Chan, for her part, urged millennials to not be afraid of failure. They might encounter a stumbling block as they go through the journey but what matters is how they use the stumbling block to move forward. (READ: A tip for startups: Dare to Fail )""It's okay to fail. As long as you learn from it, maybe you pivot, maybe you do something else but it's the whole experience of going [on] and innovating with a purpose that what we are all going for,"" she said.

These led to violent standoffs that resulted in hundreds injured from both police and protesters.Defending these tactics, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said that protesters overstepped, leaving cops with no choice but to fight back.""Sinadya 'nyo 'yan. Kayo naman ang unang nanakit. Kayo naman ang unang naging marahas, so wala kaming magagawa,"" Dela Rosa said in a news briefing.(You chose to do it. You were the first to hurt [the police] initiated the violence. You were the first ones to become violent, so we were left with no choice.)The most tense scuffle that ensued between police and protesters happened along Taft Avenue on Monday, November 13, as the ASEAN Summit officially opened a few kilometers away at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC).Police who responded to this demonstration were outnumbered as at least a thousand protesters attended the rally. (IN PHOTOS: At least 2,000 attend protests on day one of ASEAN Summit)At total of 123 activists were injured according to the Health Alliance for Democracy after the outnumbered cops used water cannons and truncheons against those who attempted to break the police barricade set up along the corner of Padre Faura Street and Taft Avenue.Around 20 other protesters and 20 cops were also injured earlier on Sunday, November 12, at Plaza Salamanca, a square near the US embassy, after demonstrators attempted to go nearer a zone marked off-limits to demonstrators.Arrest and casesPolice arrested a protester ""in the act of throwing stones at the rally near the US embassy on Sunday.Joint Task Group Peace and Order (JTG PO) representative Police Superintendent Ronald Hipolito said the protesters starting throwing stones despite them exercising maximum tolerance. They supposedly arrested Karapatan member Neil Legaspi, while the police were dispersing the violent crowd.Protesters, however, told a different story.According to Cristina Palabay, secretary general of Karapatan, Legaspi was driving the van owned by Karapatan for paralegal assistance during rallies when he was supposedly accosed by the police.Palabay said that Legaspi was forced out of the van, his hands handcuffed by two policemen  dentified by Karaptan as a certain PO1 Agcamanan and PO2 Bigcas of the Regional Public Safety Battalion, under the leadership of Task Force ASEAN.Police filed a case against Legaspi and two protest leaders  former Bayan Muna representative Teddy Casio and Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes  after the incident.The police complaint claimed that Casio, Reyes, and Legaspi violated the Public Assembly Act of 1985 by committing breach of peace, assault, and disobedience and resistance to authorities.Palabay downplayed these as nothing but trumped up charges.We are in fact mulling countercharges of carnapping and illegal search and seizure against CIDG operatives O. Silla, E. Ocampo, R. Siochi, J. Florendo, and Padua and TF ASEAN officials regarding this, Palabay said in a statement.On Tuesday, November 14, Legaspi was released by the police, with the charges against him referred for further preliminary investigation.Protest gimmicksThere was no shortage of protest gimmicks in the 6 days that activist groups claimed the streets to show their frustrations and dismay at the country's leaders who were meeting for the ASEAN Summit.

0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,11688,11,1268,2599,28,"The Azkals are denied automatic qualification to the AFC Asian Cup after a fruitless 90 minutes on Tuesday. Here are the talking points.Published 4:20 PM, November 15, 2017Match highlights:The Philippines picked up a third Asian Cup qualifying draw in a row on Tuesday after the Group F encounter against Nepal in Kathmandu finished goalless. In our previous two matches we also shared points with Yemen twice via 2-2 and 1-1 scores.After we manhandled the Nepalese 4-1 at home in March, this seemed to be an easy three points for the Philippines. Get the W, pop the champagne, and start looking for cheap flights to Dubai in 2019, where the final stage will be held.But it just wasn't to be for Thomas Dooley's men on a difficult afternoon.As I feared, this match proved to be a stumbling blockBack in January when the draw for the qualifying came out, I wrote these words here in Rappler, lamenting what I saw as an unfortunate draw.The way I see it there was no harder Pot 4 away game than Nepal, and that is exactly what we landed. The altitude and the travel make this game a true banana skin. Almost every other Pot 4 away game would have been a short hop away at sea level against a beatable team. True, an away match at Bhutan would have also meant difficult travel and a match at high altitude, but the Bhutanese are probably weaker than Nepal.That was how I felt in January. Last weekend I wrote a preview to this game talking a lot about the altitude in Nepal, and two guys I really respect in Pinoy football, Mikee Carrion, (who was the match analyst on ABS-CBN S+A,) and ex-Kaya coach Maor Rozen, reassured me that it might not be an issue.Rozen told me that up to 1500 meters above sea level, there is really nothing much to worry about with pro athletes. It's only higher than that where things become difficult. Carrion said that in South America some visiting teams to high-altitude matches sometimes deliberately come a day before so that their body doesn't have time to notice the thin air.Plus the weather was startlingly balmy, around 21 degrees celsius at kickoff, 2:15 pm local time. The sun was out too. I guess autumns in Nepal are really pleasant most of the time.By kickoff I was really liking our chances. Conditions seemed perfect for us to win.But it wasn't to be. The ground looked very firm on TV, and we seemed to have difficulty controlling the weight of our passes and first touches in the thin air. Nepal looked very organized in the back and limited our chances.The Azkals were not afraid to press in the first half. Perhaps we paid for it with some tiredness in the second? I would love to ask the players.In the end, luck was not on our side as two chances were cleared off the line and Carlie De Murga's last-gasp header clanged off the woodwork.Misagh Bahadoran was not fielded, and that likely means he just didn't have the fitness in the eyes of Dooley to get a run-out. Curt Dizon did well up top, stinging the palms of the Nepalese goalie.So in the end, this did turn out to be a tough game. Nepal is 60 places below us on the FIFA rankings, and they had nothing else but pride to play for. But it didn't matter much as we just couldn't crack them.We were without some key cogs but for me there was one injured Azkal that we missed the most....We really needed Manny OttThe center of the park was not the creative engine it could have been on Tuesday. Paul Mulders, Phil Younghusband, and Kevin Ingreso were unable to rule the middle third. There were too main aimless direct balls.Manny Ott, Mike's kuya, is out for a few months with an injured knee. We sorely needed his composure, passing touch and vision. He is that rare player with the ability to read defenses and break them down.Here's hoping that the Ceres man somehow makes it back for the March game against Tajikistan, and that the other injured Azkal talisman, Javi Patio, is upfield to receive his passes.Let's take a look at where we standOn Tuesday night Yemen and Tajikistan played to a 0-0 draw as well in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. I see this as a good development because it keeps both sides below us in the standings.The Pinoys have 9 points after two wins and three draws to lead the group. Yemen and Tajikistan are at 7 points. Two-point Nepal are out of the running for UAE in 2019.The top two in the group progress. On March 27 we tangle with Tajikistan at home and Yemen and Nepal play in the last set of group games. I gather that the favorite to host the match is Panaad again, but there has been no official announcement yet.A win against Tajikistan and we are top of the group and punch tickets to UAE. A draw will be good enough too. That gives us 10 points, and leaves the Tajiks stuck at 8, safely below us. In that scenario, Tajikistan needs Nepal to beat Yemen to give the Central Asians passage.It is still possible for us to qualify even if we lose. That brings Tajikistan to 10 and leaves us at 9. Nepal needs to either draw or beat the Yemenis, though, for us to back into the final stage in 2019.The nightmare scenario is if we fall to Tajikistan and Yemen beats Nepal. That leaves us with 9 points, a point less than the other two and out of the AFC Asian Cup.But aside from that possibility we are actually still in good shape. This nil-nil may not satisfy, but it nudges us ever so closer to the promised land of UAE in 2019.With no more Azkals play for the rest of the year, we need to give the PFL a lookThe first Philippines Football League season is nearing the finish line.

""We are all very pleased that these young men have been allowed to return home to their families and university.""We are grateful for the role that our Chinese hosts played, and for the courtesy and professionalism of the local authorities.""Scott thanked Trump, the White House, and the State Department for their assistance in resolving the case.Trump said he personally asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to intervene on behalf of the 3 players during his two-day state visit to Beijing last week.""What they did was unfortunate,"" Trump said. ""You know, you're talking about very long prison sentences. They (the Chinese authorities) do not play games.""Ball, Riley, and Hill were arrested in Hangzhou ahead of a scheduled game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai.According to ESPN, they were nabbed on suspicion of stealing from a Louis Vuitton store and later freed on bail but ordered to remain in Hangzhou.The UCLA and Georgia Tech squads were in Hangzhou for a side trip to the headquarters of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.Shoplifting can bring jail time in China depending on the value of the goods.UCLA, one of the most storied names in US college basketball with 11 men's NCAA championships, won Saturday's game in Shanghai 63-60 without the 3 players. The rest of the team flew home afterwards.Besides coinciding with Trump's visit, the case drew attention in the United States due to the involvement of Ball, one of 3 high-profile basketball-playing sons of LaVar Ball.The elder Ball has become a media personality by aggressively promoting his sons as future NBA superstars and had traveled to China on the trip to promote his Big Baller Brand shoe and apparel line.

They are not welcome here,"" Pedrosa added.A recent study published in June also found that Japan has the highest clean coal technology in the world. Last February, the Japanese government unveiled its plan to build up to 45 new coal fired power stations.Meanwhile, Trump, a known climate change denier, pulled out from the Paris climate accord for ""it does not serve American interests.""

I thought we were going to die so I told my mother to pray the rosary. As soon as we finished praying, two workers of Roger Lo, the owner of RL Appliance Incorporated, came to rescue us.God works in mysterious ways, and truly, ""the family that prays together, stays together.""Four years after Haiyan, we have completely recovered and rebuilt our home, Tacloban City, with the help of people around the world. We became more resilient, practical, and more appreciative of what we have. Each day is another chance to correct our mistakes so always try to be better. Life is short.Aaron JP Almadro, editor-in-chief of 8 Magazine and marketing manager of Nissan/BAIC/Chevrolet Tacloban The whole experience was hard to forget: the howling winds, the destruction of our house, the torment of thinking if you would survive. But what almost pushed me to the brink was finding my parents dead  my mom on the street with her face covered with a rubber tire interior, and my dad on the floor of their hotel room with blood coming out of his mouth. There were two phases in my life after Yolanda. In 2014, I was angry, hateful, vengeful, skeptical, selfish, and doubtful. But after I met the Pope and I had a heart attack in 2015, my life took a 180-degree turn. I realized the beauty of life. Now, I'm stronger, fearless, and optimistic. Winfred, former overseas Filipino worker I went around the city on a borrowed mountain bike the day after the typhoon hit. The destruction was everywhere. The streets in some of the hardest-hit areas had numerous bodies left on the side of the road, unclaimed. The feeling of shock and hopelessness was all too pervasive  one only needed to look at the faces of the survivors walking on the road to see this. An experience like Yolanda makes you realize a lot of things: the importance of family and friends, the lengths people will go to keep their loved ones safe, the kindness of strangers. An experience like this will also make you see the ugly side of human nature. However, it can also show you the nobility, compassion, and decency of the human spirit. There were people who chose to stand strong for the community and for the city, people who volunteered, people who chose to help relatives, friends, and even strangers despite their own losses. I hope that most people can look back and say that despite the tragedy that visited their lives they did something that they can be proud of. If not, then I hope that one learns from the examples shown by those who did. Maria Angela, businesswoman My most vivid memory of the typhoon that still reminds me of how catastrophic it was: I was walking from my hotel going to Anibong, near the coastal area that was hit badly, where our building was located. I felt it was the longest walk I had ever taken. My heart was racing with every step I took towards the building. I saw a few corpses on the way. At that time, I didn't know what I would see inside our building. I was fearing for the lives of people who stayed there during the typhoon.",Super Typhoon Yolanda survivors look back 4 years later

Deaths could have been averted if the consequences of a storm surge were properly explained to the public, forecasters said.It was a lesson that cost thousands of lives.Back to basicsUnderstanding the scientific jargon behind these phenomena is a challenge, especially to journalists not trained in the sciences.But we try. We spend hours of research, training, and practice to be able to translate the jargon into something easier to understand.Attention to disseminating information about risks and hazards has been the priority of Rappler, not only for typhoons or earthquakes, but for other natural or man-made emergencies as well.The harsh lessons of Yolanda pushed us to make information related to disaster-preparedness, response, and recovery more easily understood by the public.We created a platform that overlays on a map relevant information such as hazards, evacuation centers, and police posts among others. This platform is called Agos which crowdsources online reports to connect those in need.As a newbie journalist who covered the disaster beat, churning out knowledge pieces and running after local government officials for their disaster management plans were part of the day to day.We try to combine the hard facts with creative storytelling to engage the reader.Part of our coverage included discussing the impact of the ""Big One""  a 7.2-magnitude earthquake  that could happen when the West Valley Fault Line moves. We published interactive quizzes for the public to easily test if their house can withstand major earthquakes.We also saw the importance of reminding the public about events such as the sinking of M/V Princess of the Stars or the eruption of Mt Pinatubo to prevent a repeat.Efficient governanceBut all these boil down to governance.Years have passed since Yolanda struck the country and still, many communities affected by the typhoon have yet to return to their normal lives.There was a ""mismatch"" in resettlement requirements as estimated by the housing agencies. Four years later, the backlog in housing is still an issue.The Yolanda rehabilitation experience is not an isolated case. The country experiences an average of 20 typhoons and a couple of earthquakes a year, but reconstruction lags behind.Officials say that it could be attributed to a lack of budget or capacity to implement projects.That's why we continue to watch. We continue to write. When it comes to rehabilitation, we follow the money trail. We demand accountability.In Rappler, we don't cover disasters only as they happen.

From 2013 to 2015, Japanese FDI within the region amounted to $19.2 billion, or 15.4% of total inbound investment in the market. This also represents 16.7% of Japans total overseas investment.Over the last two decades, just as Japan has increased its trade ties with ASEAN member countries, investment into Japan from Southeast Asian based companies has increased. Opportunities in the Japanese market across a range of industries continue to attract investment from our neighbors, says Masataka Fujita, Secretary General, of the ASEAN Promotion Centre on Trade, Investment and Tourism (ASEAN-Japan Centre). We intend to work even closer with our friends across the region to encourage business partnerships, trade and investment.The Philippines has been particularly cited to be an important consumer market for Japan, due to our young, educated population.Japanese companies invest heavily in production value-chain projects and electronic, automotive, and chemical industries within the region.

While 50% of our customers are currently Japanese, our relationship with KEMET Group will allow us to access customers in Europe and the Americas, says Shigenori Oyama, President of TOKIN CorporationTOKYO CENTURY CORPORATIONWho they are: The company was formerly called Century Tokyo Leasing Corporation, but they changed their name to reflect their expanding suite of financial services. Financing is the foundation of economic growth, especially for small to medium enterprises. Theres a rising need for more dynamic financial products in Southeast Asia that TCC hopes to address.Why they matter in the ASEAN: Aside from being involved with various financial groups and transportation services in the region,Tokyo Century Corporation has also established a partnership with Grab, Southeast Asias leading ride-hailing platform.Growth plan: Tokyo Century Corporation is aiming to be the best financing partner in the region so business owners can grow their businesses and promote their products without any major financial constraints, says Yasushi Yoshino, Senior Managing Executive Officer of Tokyo Century Corporation.NIPPON EXPRESSWho they are: A leading logistics company in Japan. They move goods and services around the world and are present in 261 cities across 42 countries.Why they matter in the ASEAN: Last year, Nippon launched their Global Logistics Innovation Centre in Singapore to better serve their market outside Japan.

Members of his Cabinet could be seen behind him smiling at the remark, so characteristic of the President.At the ASEAN-Korea Summit later that day, Duterte said he is forced by protocol to respectfully, most respectfully request the media to disappear, eliciting some laughter from reporters watching his speech from the International Media Center at the Manila World Trade Center.After his opening remarks at the ASEAN-Canada Summit on Wednesday, Duterte phrased his request with the help of one of his favorite Bible verses, Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.It is said that there is always a time for everything under the sun. And I am addressing it to the media. A time to join and a time to not join, he said.At a later Wednesday summit, Duterte changed his tone, saying he, in fact, wanted media to stay for the entire meeting but had to abide by the dictates of the organizing committee.Im sorry, but if I had my way, Id invite you to participate. But the problem is the working papers, and this is not my words, our open session ends here, he told the media.He repeated this tone at the East Asia Summit.I know that you like it here. I want you to participate. The problem is, the working papers of the Secretariat do not like you, he said.He didnt stop there. Instead of keeping the customary dismissal of media short and sweet, Duterte continued playfully, Its not us. We love exposures to media. We are almost all politicians here. But the Secretariat is stiff.His colorful way of asking the media to leave the meetings began with his bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump.After a reporter tried to ask Trump about whether he would bring up human rights violations with Duterte, the Philippine President said the media better leave so the two of them can talk more comfortably about sensitive issues.""We would be talking on matters that [are] of interest [to] both the Philippines and [the US]. With you around, guys, you are the spies,"" said Duterte.Thanks to the mediaBut before the ASEAN Summit's events were over, Duterte acknowledged the work of journalists who covered the international conference.In his last ASEAN press conference on Tuesday night, he said, ""I wish to express my appreciation to the members of the media for your coverage throughout the year of the Philippines chairmanship of ASEAN.""Describing media as ""invaluable partners"" in raising awareness about ASEAN, Duterte told the roomful of reporters and cameramen, ""I thank you for getting that message across to the public.""The fiery Philippine leader has a complicated relationship with reporters, aware of their power to record his deeds as part of history but also smarting from their criticism of him and his administration.He has launched insults and threats to certain media organizations and journalists but has also invited members of the press to Malacaang dinners.

Latest ""official"" data from the Philippine National Police (PNP) shows that at least 3,850 people have been killed in police operations, while at least 2,290 others were killed mostly by unknown vigilantes.But Duterte has consistently responded with threats, while invoking Philippine independence  whether to slap or place on the immigration blacklist individuals who dare criticize his campaign.

Police have been at the forefront of the drug war since it was launched in July 2016 up until they were ordered out of it by Duterte himself in October 2017. Police spearheaded efforts to catch top drug personalities, as well as programs to make alleged drug users and pushers surrender"".Along with this huge role came allegations that police resorted to extralegal means in the name of the anti-illegal drugs campaign.

And I am not kidding. Her death affects me in a very peculiar way.That we belong to the same age group is not really what bothers me. I am feeling a bit bad because I had never paid attention to her when I was all about That's Entertainment in the 80s. There was nothing to dislike about her except that in the 80s, too, it was not very cool to be trying too hard in school. And I felt like she had the effect of being that person who tries to too hard.I remember having a conversation with my cousin about why Melissa Gibbs is more appealing because she would always make it appear like shes got better things to do than to be singing or dancing in front of an audience. Her body language would always almost read: This is so baduy (in bad taste) but what the heck, here we go...""Her reluctance was so appealing. Her superb singing voice was elevated by her cool demeanor. Each performance was rendered with effortless perfection, even her reading from a long list of sponsors was just so attractively ambivalent. She definitely marked a distance between her and her very own performances. She was graceful yet so not invested.Isabel Granada would be the opposite. She always gave it her all. She was too earnest for comfort. There was no distance between her and a pop tune, it was almost ridiculous. Her sacred seriousness was almost alienating. She never made it to the headlines of nasty gossip shows as she was perhaps friends with everyone.One might question how deep those friendships were as they must have been devoid of an other or an ""enemy"" that keeps friendships solid and real. And it is all because Isabel Granada did not look like she was interested in marking people as her enemies. She did not have time for that. Her time did look like it was divided between performing and practicing for those performances. She was just there anywhere and everywhere where compulsion reigns.So we were not just into her, this Hispanic looking actor who also seemed to represent all too Pinoy values. But not until a couple of years back. Pinoy showbiz would feature her in the most provocative way: ""Must see! Isabel Granada beauty and body still explosive after all these years."" She created a stir, and it is all true. She embodied what is required of women who are just about ""to let go of themselves.""Contempt against womenIf you are a woman of Granada's age (40s), misogyny or that ingrained contempt and prejudice against women demands that you constantly look like you are just about to turn 18.So for the past few years, what Granada was for women who paid attention to her re-entry into showbiz is a symbol that amplifies an effective value. This is the value of looking like a young girl in middle age. This is not an obsession of women in general but it certainly affects most in the middle and upper classes.In a way, Granada as a symbol also became a replacement for a commitment to looking like a young girl. It is actually less an addiction to a physical regiment that could actually make one look like a young girl than a fascination for Granada's ways and means to ""stay young and attractive."" All of which are on YouTube and her personal Instagram account.Despite her death, Granada continues to play a role in what seems to be a contradictory phenomenon of being addicted to another person.Living the gameWhat the Marxist-Lacanian philosopher Slavoj Zizek would call interpassive delegated addiction is clearly explained by another philosopher in the same tradition, Robert Pfaller. Pfaller points to substitute activities or interpassive practices - such as bibliomania, photocopying, collecting video recordings as forms of addiction that rest on the principle of play (115).These interpassive practices are also called substitute activities because they function as ""symbolic, protective measures, (which) serve to overcome an impulse of hatred towards something that is outwardly loved but latently hated (115). Obsessive-compulsive photocopying, video copying, book-buying function to keep at bay the rising displeasure for reading, consuming television, and so on.We are supposed to maintain a positive attitude toward keeping fit and healthy through the consumption of organic meatless food and a focused and efficient workout. ""Just do it,"" is Nike's command. Following celebrities like Granada on social media helps us through it all.This act of following social media accounts of beauty and fitness icons is an activity that interpassives love to stage in order to postpone or avoid carrying out what is to be done to actually look fit and young.I personally feel ambivalent about this particular activity. On one level, I feel frustrated for wasting away time watching ""explosive beauties"" instead of actually turning myself into one, which is too insane of a secret wish to mention. On another level, and definitely on a higher plane of intellectual and political maturity, I do think that to make myself valuable under the system of capital is the height of misadventure, and thus delinking from the capitalist value chain is the goal. Of course, doing nothing and eating everything will not cut anyone off from participating in all that capitalist and crisis-driven spiraling.In all this, I only think it is fair to remember Isabel Granada, the earnest and invested young girl who, to some people's delight and dismay, turned herself into a young girl yet again in her late adult years.Yes, misogynys prescription for women to look perpetually young and attractive has resulted in an addiction. And some of you might have already heard about how psychoanalysis characterizes addiction as a form of play. Yet Granada did not look like she was addicted to this play. She lived the game. - Rappler.comSarah Raymundo is an assistant professor at the Center for International Studies, University of the Philippines-Diliman.

As we lead this years special ASEAN Summit, we might ask ourselves: How can we bolster our shaky standing in the region?Published 12:01 PM, November 13, 2017This year were hosting the ASEAN Summit for the third time ever, and also on ASEANs 50th founding anniversary.Its therefore as good a time as any to step back, take stock of our place in the region, and examine how we have progressed compared to our neighbors.A good way to do this is by comparing average incomes across ASEAN countries, noting that income is one of the best  albeit imperfect  ways to measure and compare peoples well-being.Figure 1 below compares the GDP (or gross domestic product) per person across all ASEAN member-countries and across time. This graph speaks volumes.First, while ASEAN countries are generally becoming richer over time, some have advanced faster than others.The Philippines rate of progress, in particular, has been embarrassingly slow. With the exception of Brunei and Singapore, the Philippines used to lead the pack in the 1950s. But Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia have long overtaken us: Malaysia in 1968, Thailand in 1984, Indonesia in 1989.Fast forward to 2014 (when the latest comparable data is available), only the CLMV countries  Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam  are poorer than us. But remarkably, their incomes have caught up so fast that they are soon poised to match Filipinos income levels (Viet Nam may have even already overtaken us).Many say that the Philippines is the fastest-growing economy in ASEAN today. But in truth, that distinction belongs to Myanmar. In fact, its the fastest-growing economy in the world. From 2010 to 2014, GDP per person in Myanmar grew at 7.2% per year on average; in the Philippines, it grew at only 4.6%.For the greater part of the 20th century, Myanmar was indeed the poorest in ASEAN. But by 2014, the average Burmese is richer than the average Cambodian, and is now nearly as rich as the average Vietnamese or Lao.What explains this remarkable turnaround? The gradual return of democratic institutions and economic openness partly explain Myanmars impressive rise from the doldrums. But starting from such a low base also explains much of its recent growth (also called base effect).Wasted opportunitiesThe Philippines, once the leader in the region, is now the follower. Whos to blame for the countrys lackluster performance?Many scholars have looked into this, and one common theme emerging from the corpus of research is this: a combination of external factors and bad domestic policies  compounded by President Marcos corrupt and debt-driven leadership  set us up for failure.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ASEAN countries faced much the same external shocks that led to economic troubles  oil price hikes from OPEC and a US recession that raised world interest rates and reduced export demand.But only in the Philippines did these external factors result in a permanently lower income growth trajectory, commencing in the 1983 debt crisis. This recession  the deepest since WWII  is manifested in the dip of income per capita you see around 1983.Back in the 1960s, however, the income path of the Philippines was already flatter than that of other ASEAN countries, especially Malaysia and Thailand.During this time, our neighbors pursued export-oriented industrialization. But Filipino leaders at the time focused too much on promoting domestic production in whats called import substitution industrialization. In short, this means we boosted local firms output and protected them from foreign competition, in the hopes that they would develop their own production capabilities and technologies.But instead, our industries got used to very high levels of government support and protection and failed to mature vis--vis their ASEAN counterparts.This pattern was largely continued (and exacerbated) during the Marcos regime, whose crony capitalism  characterized by the proliferation of monopolies, special privileges, and damaged institutions  further removed businesses incentives to be efficient and productive, leading to the stagnation of manufacturing.All in all, decades of bad economic policies and politics brought the country down. Using statistical techniques, Manuel Albis and I showed in a previous article that Filipinos couldve been much richer now had we just followed the growth patterns seen in the rest of ASEAN. (READ: Were it not for Marcos, Filipinos today would have been richer)New challengesUnless the Duterte government implements crucial reforms today  especially in foreign investments  our place in ASEAN will continue to be imperiled.Investments drive future growth. But the data show that the Philippines investment rate has been historically low, owing in no small measure to our similarly low saving rate and the many restrictions that have diminished our attractiveness as an investment destination.Vietnam is becoming an increasingly important competitor for foreign direct investments (FDI). Members of the South Korean Chamber of Commerce, for example, are reportedly moving to Vietnam because doing business there is around two-thirds less costly than in the Philippines.A recent survey also revealed that US companies are choosing to expand their businesses mostly in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Indonesia. The Philippines is near the bottom of their priority list (see Figure 2).Our lacking infrastructure is a major investment turnoff. In the latest Global Competitiveness Report, the Philippines lags behind the rest of ASEAN in terms of the quality of roads, railroads, ports, air transport, and electricity supply. (In fact, we scored worst on roads and air transport.)Aside from infrastructure, investors are also looking closely at prospective growth: they want to invest wherever growth is expected to be faster, not slower.But the 2017 growth forecasts for the Philippines have been dropping in recent months, and converging toward the low end of the government forecast (see Figure 3). Among other things, this is on account of the slower-than-expected rollout of Build, Build, Build.Way forwardCompared to our ASEAN neighbors, the Philippines has treaded on a deviant growth path. Now, our poorer neighbors are growing faster than us. As we lead this years special ASEAN Summit, we might ask ourselves: How can we bolster our shaky standing in the region?In a sense, the answers are already staring us in the face: we need to step up our investment and infrastructure game  fast.Although the Duterte economic managers are working hard on this, they have their work cut out for them. Business confidence is at a 3-year low and 52% of surveyed US businesses thought the current administration is ineffective in boosting business confidence and promoting investment.The least we can do now is to do business as usual, and not make matters worse. But if our aim is to regain our economic leadership in the region, its clear that this alone will hardly suffice.

But the day it acquires that too much economic weight for comfort  with handy geopolitical weapon to boot  may not be that far away in the horizon.How it turns out depends on factors that bear watching  the pace and depth of ASEAN countries' regional integration efforts and diversification of its economic relationships, China's calibration of the ""quality"" of its economic engagement in the region and its trust deficit, and ASEAN societies' response to China's style of economic cooperation.Recent analyses make the case for why ASEAN's 10 member countries need to work on deepening trade and investment ties among themselves  for their own economic resilience and to maintain precious elbow room in international relations given the likelihood that China will use its economic weight in the pursuit of strategic interests in issues such as the South China Sea disputes.At present, China is more of a trade power than it is a major player in foreign direct investments (FDI) in the ASEAN region, according to a paper published this month by the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.""Although China has leverage in terms of trade, its investments are yet to catch up with those from other developed countries. China can therefore not really as yet be called a dominant economic power in Southeast Asia,"" said the paper by Sanjita Basu Das, lead researcher for economic affairs at the ASEAN Studies Center, ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. ""However, as China increases its outbound investments and completes more infrastructure projects, its geopolitical influence in the region will definitely increase.""""One cannot conclude outright that China is a dominant economic power in Southeast Asia for FDI, which one can do when it comes to trade,"" Das explained. ""Apart from the less developed ASEAN members  Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar  Beijing is not really capable of holding ASEAN countries hostage economically to advance its strategic demands.""Danger: OverdependenceIn recent years, ASEAN countries have become much more trade dependent on China. All member economies except Singapore have trade deficits with the world's largest trading nation, meaning they rely on China for much of their imports, ASEAN data show.The volume of ASEAN-China trade stood at $345 billion in 2015, the second largest after the $543-billion volume of intra-ASEAN trade. After China came ASEAN's trade with Japan, the European Union and the United States, with trade volumes of more than $200 billion. China has been ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009.From 2005 to 2015, China's trade with ASEAN grew by the largest margin  13.2%  among its trade partners. South Korea-ASEAN trade grew by 10.9% over the same period, but ASEAN's trade with the EU, Japan, and the US grew only by 5.4%, 5%, and 3.6%, respectively.In other words, ""the weight of advanced economies in ASEAN's total trade has been declining, while that of China's is on the rise,"" wrote Das. ""As multinational firms undertook single production processes across multiple countries over the last few decades, China and ASEAN economies have become intertwined in a web of regional production networks, thus increasing their mutual dependence.""In terms of FDI, China still lags behind intra-ASEAN investments, which made up 18% of total FDI flows in the region, and those of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. However, the growth rate of FDI inflows into ASEAN in 2005-2015 reached 33.4% from China and 30.3% from South Korea.Likewise, given China's strategic push in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar and the sharp rise in its own outward investments, it is a much bigger investor there than it is in other ASEAN countries. China is the largest source of foreign investments in Cambodia and Laos. As of end-2016, it accounted for close to 35% of Cambodia's FDI. In Lao PDR, China's accumulated investments exceeded $6 billion in 2016.Overall, the more diversified mix of FDI in ASEAN means that there is no one single dominant source of investments for the region, one that can only be good for ASEAN's economic health. The US is a leading investor in the Philippines and Malaysia, but the EU leads in Singapore. Japan is a major investor in Thailand and Indonesia, while South Korea is the one in Vietnam and Malaysia, as Das' paper shows.China's growing economic footprint brings with it a new appreciation for the progress ASEAN has made  though it could be deeper  in relying more on its own members through regional economic integration over the past 5 decades.ASEAN countries are a key source of investments among themselves, particularly in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. But China's growing FDI in the region may actually be bigger, if one considers the fact that Hong Kong is a gateway for investment in the region.As China's FDI outflows pick up  partly due to its search for overseas destinations to invest overcapacity in steel and cement  these investment figures look certain to go up in ASEAN. ""Moreover, given the huge demand for infrastructure financing among the Southeast Asian countries and China's indifferent attitude towards political systems and human rights, the quantum of investment flows could grow considerably,"" Das said.Chinese infrastructure engagement is expected to grow, given its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) Initiative and funding through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and cooperation funds with ASEAN. These come with Chinese workers, equipment, and construction materials that have not met with wholesale optimism in countries like Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, or Malaysia because they do not provide local jobs or skills transfer, among others.China needs to be sensitive as well to the ""soft"" side of the impact of its economic presence in investments, trade or aid  and where it may well have a learning curve as a regional power compared to, say, the longer involvements of Japan or the United States in the region.What, then, can ASEAN do? ""To mitigate the risks, the ASEAN countries must strengthen their own economic integration,"" Das wrote. While ASEAN member countries are ""already prominent trade and investment partners among themselves,"" they need to put in place cross-border policies that keep foreign investors coming.""In addition, the ASEAN countries must diversify their trading basket across major economies,"" she pointed out. Among others, ASEAN and EU may be restarting talks over an ASEAN-EU free trade agreement, previously stalled by human rights issues over Myanmar.One major way would be for ASEAN to speed up completion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), one of ASEAN's deliverables during its 50th anniversary this year. But however much analysts say it is virtually the only regional economic game in town  with the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) far from being a trade negotiating forum  RCEP is nowhere near completion.After 19 rounds of negotiations as of July this year, ASEAN-led RCEP discussions have become caught in differences over tariff reduction offers, the degree of liberalization in services and the movement of professionals, reflecting the challenge of building what is to be the largest trade deal encompassing nearly half of the world's population, 30% of global income, and 30% of global trade.When it does bring together ASEAN and its 6 existing trade agreement partners  Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea  RCEP would be ""the most important example of ASEAN Centrality and its benefits for ASEAN states,"" pointed out Malcolm Cook and Das in an October paper on ""RCEP's Strategic Opportunity.""If RCEP gets completed in 2018, the ratification process would likely take one year so implementation would start earliest in 2020, the paper added.ASEAN countries are well aware that putting too many eggs in China's basket opens them to bullying if Beijing chooses to push economic diplomacy and use its economic power in the geopolitical sphere.Das' paper has a reminder of how South Korea got a taste of ""economic retribution"" when earlier in 2017, China punished it for its installation of the US missile defense system THAAD. China's increased scrutiny of South Korea's Lotte Mart led to the closure of most of its stores in China, whose government also advised Chinese tour groups to stay away.Economics is politics, tooWhile ASEAN states are drawn to easier access to China's funds, ""the OBOR Initiative has fueled concern among many Southeast Asia countries about the security risks of economic overdependence on China,"" said a November paper on ""Infrastructure Connectivity and Regional Economic Integration in East Asia: Progress and Challenges,"" published by the Lee Kwan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. ""Hence, Southeast Asian countries are cautious [about] becoming economically over-dependent on China as they fear being forced to adopt a pro-China foreign policy stance.""Given China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, Das wrote: ""If the maritime disputes remain unresolved, Beijing may be tempted to use its economic leverage to advance its strategic objectives in the SCS and beyond. It may also try to own infrastructure assets in ASEAN to service its national interests.""This may be similar to China's investment in Sri Lanka's strategic Hambatota port, which has come under scrutiny as a brand of China's economic presence. China is involved in huge infrastructure projects in ASEAN, such as the construction of the Vientiane-Kunming railway.""China's perceived assertiveness in foreign policy, particularly in relation to territorial disputes in the South and East China Sea, is unfortunately helping to create a negative state image for China abroad,"" said the LKY School of Public Policy paper on infrastructure in East Asia.""This is not supportive of China's ambition to be perceived as a responsible and friendly power in the region and beyond.""

It's also a movie commemorating the anime's 20th anniversary.But there was one big change from the anime series that blew fans' minds away more than that time everyone went crazy for Pokmon Go: Pikachu spoke.The yellow critter spoke  and not in the way we've been used to. It spoke in plain English.In the scene, as Ash starts to faint, he asks Pikachu why it won't go back to its Pokball. Pikachu has always been known for being sort of a rebel this way: it doesn't stay in its Pokball like most of its other ilk do. Now we finally have an answer why.Responding to Ash, Pikachu says, in its sweetest voice, ""It's because I always want to be with you."" Yup.How are people reacting?

It was a good thing that he was able to do so quickly, as Pepe is reportedly faring better than he did during the first stroke which happened on April 2015 and left the musician with a minor speech impediment. The second stroke took place July last year.He has difficulty swallowing, but he can talk. He is conscious.

The analysis suggested the tweets were viewed hundreds of millions of times.The research paper tracked 156,252 Russian accounts that mentioned #Brexit in original posts or retweets. Of these, a prolific account called Stormbringer15 was considered by experts as almost certainly a Russian troll factory creation.""Sowing discordThe tweets were apparently meant to create tension in the country, with most tweets encouraging a vote for Brexit, while a lesser number were pro-Remain.

(READ: More governments manipulate media with 'bots,' trolls  study)Not as free as beforeCountries were rated based on obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of human rights. Higher ratings denoted less freedom in a specific category, with 0 being the most free and 100 being the least free.The Philippines still enjoys ""free"" status in terms of internet freedom with an overall score of 28, but it is less free in 2017 compared to last year, when it got a score of 26.Obstacles to internet accessThe Philippines' internet penetration and average internet connection speeds improved in 2017. It must be remembered, however, that while the speeds have increased slightly, the Philippines does not rank highly in terms of either 4G LTE speeds or general broadband speeds.Also pointed out in the report was the National Broadband Plan, which aims to expand internet connectivity by 2020, as well as bring more affordable connectivity to people using new technologies and infrastructure building.Instances of the National Telecommunications Commission ordering shutdowns of cellular phone signals for connectivity were also an issue. This was done in Manila, Cebu, and Iloilo in January.Additionally, the Philippines also lacked competition to drive down prices and improve service. The landscape is ""dominated by PLDT and Globe who both have acquired a number of minor players in the last two decades.""Limits on contentIn terms of limits on content, Freedom House said, ""No systematic government censorship of online content has been documented in the Philippines, and internet users enjoyed unrestricted access to both domestic and international sources of information during the coverage period of this report."" It also added that the government does not normally request for content to be removed.It did note, however, that rare content blocks existed, such as the blocking of some pornographic sites in the country.Aside from the ""keyboard army"" in the section on ""Media, Diversity and Content Manipulation,"" one additional entry was posted: allowing pro-administration bloggers to cover Palace events and the subsequent discussion of a creation of a code of conduct for bloggers.Outside the scope of Freedom House's report, it can be argued that the pro-administration bloggers also hold additional power as part of the Presidential Communication Operations Office (PCOO). In November, PCOO Assistant Secretary Esther Margaux ""Mocha"" Uson asked her boss, Secretary Martin Andanar, to reclassify news organization Rappler as part of the social media category under her purview. (FACT CHECK: Can PCOO reclassify Rappler as 'Social Media' under Uson?)""Generally, though, the Philippine blogosphere is rich and thriving,"" Freedom House said.Violations of user rightsThe Philippines' lowest ranking  a score of 13  was on violations of user rights.The report explained that the country had 494 complaints of online libel, with some cases resulting in imprisonment. The rush of online libel complaints stemmed from a Supreme Court ruling in favor of punishing online libel under the Cybercrime Prevention Act.Lawmakers, meanwhile, revisited a draft law that would require telecommunications providers to register prepaid SIM card owners, though this had not gone beyond first reading.While there were no reports of physical violence targeting internet users during the period covered by the report, violence against journalists, either as threat or as action, is still a problem in the country.Explained Freedom House, ""As of early 2017, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that at least 78 Philippine journalists had been killed in relation to their work  most covering political issues like corruption  since 1992.""The culture of impunity remains an issue, the message being individuals exercising free speech can be attacked at will. In his first press conference a month before being sworn in, President Rodrigo Duterte said corrupt journalists deserved to be killed.Duterte has since continued to accuse journalists of unfair reporting, and in recent days  specifically during a meeting with US President Donald Trump  called journalists ""spies.""Technological attacks against journalist institutions have also been a problem.The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism's website was defaced by hackers in 2016 following reports on Duterte's war on drugs. The PCIJ noted that ""a phrase with explicit curse and threat has been written by the attackers into our stories.""The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, meanwhile, faced a ""massive denial of service attack"" in January 2017.Read the full Freedom on the Net 2017 report here.

The 3500 square-meter property has over 20,000 beds of oyster mushrooms.The mushrooms are cultivated, harvested, refrigerated, and preserved using scientifically-based processes, as they will usually only remain fresh for a day. This also encouraged the owners to explore more ways of preserving and processing the harvested mushrooms.Lilets now offers a wide array of processed mushroom products, from dried mushrooms, lumpia mushrooms, and pickled mushrooms, to mushroom siomai and sweetened mushrooms.

So its no surprise that the average Filipino farmer is 57 years old, with younger generations opting out of farming in pursuit of a ""better life"" elsewhere.This is why Cherrie Atilano is pushing to make farming ""cool, smart, and humane.""Growing up in a farm in Negros Occidental, Atilano started her advocacy in agriculture when she was 12 years old.""It pains me everytime I talk to our farmers. We ask them if they have bank account or if they have a notion of having a bank account. They think it's just for rich people. They don't have any concept of saving,"" Atilano said.Farming has been a neglected sector by the government for decades, Atilano added. There is much work to be done in empowering farmers and farming communities.""Agriculture was the Philippines' backbone before. But along the way, it was somehow forgotten. I always say that agriculture in the Philippines is politicized. We measure the yield of crops but we dont really measure the impact on the farmers lives,"" she said.Atilano added: ""The government should really focus on building this backbone. Because agriculture is a huge industry. When you plant rice, it is a plant industry. You know, when you plant coffee, it can be a coffee industry. When you plant cotton, of course, our clothing comes from cotton. You know when you plant a cacao, it will be a chocolate industry.""Agriculture for millennialsAtilano started AGREA (agriculture and Gaea), a social enterprise that hopes to empower farmers and get more people to start farming. Its goal is three-fold: to eradicate poverty for farming and fishing families, to mitigate the effects of climate change, and to establish food security in the Philippines.""We believe in Agrea that everything we do is about cultivation of human beings. Thats why it took us a while to do a lot of community organizing with our farming communities...We do sustainable agricultural practices so the farmers can be resilient even if there are typhoons or floods that may come. But more than that our goal for them is to really be financially literate,"" she said.Currently, their efforts are focused in Marinduque  one of the poorest provinces in the entire archipelago due to decades of mining. By implementing a one-island economy model, AGREA hopes to ensure foood security for and mitigate environmental and social impacts on the community.If the model becomes successful, Atilano plans to replicate it in other parts of the country.The work is not easy but Atilano says it's worth it.""I think, going out of your comfort zone is the most comfortable thing in life. Its the most comfortable zone in life that you can experience, Atilano said.She added that millennials need to commit to their passions and advocacies in order to make them work.""Many young people, theyre so passionate in things. But when it demands more sacrifices, it demands more going out of your comfort zone, its so easy for them to give up,"" she said.Atilano added: ""The world needs sustainable nurturers. Nurturers that could endure the problems in our society. That could always see opportunities out of these problems. And for me, for those millennials, it is really more on investing on, sacrificing for what you love to do.""This is why Atilano was named Earth Mover for the Move Awards 2016. Her work shows that farming can be a friendly, sustainable, and lucrative profession.  Rappler.com",WATCH: Making agriculture a viable career for millennials

I think that somewhat reflects the temperature of China-Philippine relations which is also going pretty high,"" Li said on Wednesday, November 15, through a translator.He hopes the two countries will ""strengthen this positive momentum"" to ""make up for the time we might have lost.""Li's metaphor aptly took off from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's own remarks in his state visit to Beijing roughly a year ago, in October 2016.Back then, Duterte used China's seasons to describe the new phase of Philippine-China ties.""Even as we arrived in Beijing close to winter, this is a springtime of our relationship,"" he had said in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping.On Wednesday, Li described that Beijing visit as an ""icebreaking"" trip.Li said the renewed friendship has already led to concrete gains for the Philippines. In the last 10 months, for instance, he said China has become the Philippines' ""top trading partner.""He also cited China's importation of ""13,000 batches of tropical fruits"" from the Southeast Asian country and the 14 new flights between the two countries.Li expects Chinese tourists to make ""some one million trips"" to the Philippines by the end of the year.Duterte to 'reciprocate'During the Chinese leader's visit to Malacaang, he and Duterte witnessed the signing of 14 deals, including a P1.1-billion grant for the rehabilitation of war-torn Marawi City.They also launched the Binondo-Intramuros and Estrella-Pantaleon Bridges Project and Mindanao Drug Rehabilitation Center, funded by a grant from China.Duterte was effusive in his thanks during their expanded bilateral meeting, even saying he hopes to one day ""reciprocate"" China's generosity.Duterte said: ""We are not really in parity as yours. But maybe in the years to come the Filipinos will reciprocate what you have done for us.""He said he owed China a ""debt of gratitude.""""At this time, we cannot offer you anything because we are the ones needing help. But maybe in the future, Philippines would also show its debt of gratitude to China,"" said Duterte.As expected, no mention of the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) dispute or the Hague ruling won by Manila against Beijing was mentioned in their public statements.But Li alluded to them when he spoke of the ""ups and downs"" in their countries' relationship.""Due to well-known reasons for some period of time, there were much doubts expressed by international media outlets as to whether the friendship between our two countries would be able to consolidate and even last,"" said Li.He added that it's high time their two nations ""tell our own stories.""Li expressed China's wish for the heightened cooperation between Beijing and Manila to last even beyond Duterte's 6-year term, which ends in 2022.""My suggestion is that our two sides may sit down together to discuss and formulate cooperation plans in these areas, lasting for the next 5 or even to 10 years,"" said the Chinese Premier.Li is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the Philippines during the Duterte administration.

They, along with a separate independent minority bloc composed of lawmakers from progressive groups, constitute the House opposition.The opposition, in particular, criticized the regional blocs silence on human rights issues  violence against the Rohingya Myanmar and the killing linked to Dutertes bloody drug war in the Philippines.ASEAN chose to ignore its socio political mandates of promoting Human Rights, said Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a board member of the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights. (READ: ASEAN leaders sign commitment protecting migrant workers)State leaders have adopted a sort of diplomatic silence on the human rights abuse and EJKs under Duterte's war on drugs considering that Duterte becomes sensitive when that issue is brought up, observed Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano. (READ: The Deafening Silence of ASEAN on Human Rights Violations)Alejano, however, thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and to some extent, United States President Donald Trump for at least mentioning Dutertes drug war in formal bilateral meetings, statements, or chance conversations on the sidelines of the summit.Villarin said the over P15 billion spent to host the ASEAN was seemingly wasted. He criticized the ASEAN way of ignoring human rights and other contentious issues such as territorial claims against global power house China. Although China is not a member of ASEAN, it joins the gathering during the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN-China Summit, to name a few.Chinese Premiere Li Keqiang attended the summits in Manila.Sovereignty issues like our claims over the WPS are swept under the rug so as not to antagonize a bully in the region, China, from which we want to get an economic bonanza, said Villarin. It was during the ASEAN-China summit that leaders agreed to beginning talks on a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.Duterte himself said the summit exhausted him. As ASEAN chair, he opened almost all of the summits during the event. On the sidelines, he also held bilateral meetings with other countries.

It earned her various accolades, including being recognized by Ernst & Young as Woman Entrepreneur of the Year-Philippines in 2011.Fast forward to 2017, gender disparity is less of an issue to Agudo and her peers.HARI and the entire industry are facing disruptive technologies that will likely erode the double-digit growth in vehicle sales in the Philippines that players have been enjoying in the past years.The continued demand for the services of ride-sharing firms, like Grab and Uber, and other potential innovative alternatives to consumer mobility, such as driverless cars and flying taxis, will shift market positions of current players, Agudo shared.By 2030, the evolution of the industry  not whether one is male or female  will decide who will be the losers and winners.

This was driven by lower revenues, lower proceeds from insurance claims, and a premium paid for the early redemption of the company's US dollar-denominated bonds.But this, EDC noted, was partly offset by lower foreign exchange losses and cheaper financing costs for the period.Earthquake's effectsEDC attributed the drop to the effect that July's magnitude 6.5 earthquake had on the firm's Leyte unit, its largest. At the time the earthquake hit, EDC said its Leyte unit was producing 540 megawatts (MW) of electricity but it had to be stopped.The firm has since brought back to service all of its major units, save for two 60-MW units in its Mahanagdong geothermal plant.

However, not all ideas can stand out. (READ: Standout solutions: The winning ideas from #HackSociety 2017 )In the Philippines, a study shows there are already 164,473 social enterprises contributing to poverty alleviation. These innovative social enterprises have been trying to solve different problems.During the ASEAN + Social Good Summit held at the Rappler HQ on Monday, November 13, various experts and social entrepreneurs discussed different insights on how to make a social enterprise idea thrive.According to Percival Cendea, a former commissioner at the National Youth Commission, what makes millennials move forward with their ideas is their pasaway mindset.""In Filipino, we have this term called pasaway which can be translated into English as being unruly or the refusal to follow rules. You can't just give millennials a problem and say there are no solutions. They will always find answers to the solution,"" Cendea said.He added that a good thing about millennials today is that they don't stop seeking and coming up with bold and crazy solutions for the problems that the elders might have given up on.Two of the panelists during the discussion served as perfect examples.Cristina Guanzon and Pauline Guanzon are sisters who founded E.A.R.S by Innovable, Incorporated.E.A.R.S. stands for Early Action Response System, which offers a wearable device for the deaf. It has a sensor and vibration system that can serve as a safety assistant for the deaf in public places.Born with a disability, Cristina chose to seek solutions that can help her. She did not let her disability define what she can and cannot do.Pauline said that it was the disability that served as the greatest motivation for her sister to innovate.""People with disabilities are not less of a person. They just have different strengths and abilities. [Christina] wanted to prove that she is not just this, she can do so much more,"" Pauline added.Katrina Chan, Executive Director of QBO Innovation Hub, also shared what talents they look for in millennials today.""There are so many ideas and innovations out there but it's really the entrepreneurs that understand the problem, validate with their customers, and execute solutions that enjoy success and make an impact,"" she said.TipsJust like any other startups, aspiring social entrepreneurs must be aware of the inevitable challenges they will face as they turn their ideas into actions.Pauline Guanzon shared one important tip in times of trying times. ""Stand firm on your why because your who and how might change,"" she said.She added that there might people who will bring you down but what is important is that you find the right people to work with.Another tip would be to check the replicability of the idea or solution. ""How do you develop a franchise for a certain idea? Try to imagine your program in a different place. If it works, then it is a better idea. Imagination and collaboration will play a big role,"" Cendea shared.Chan, for her part, urged millennials to not be afraid of failure. They might encounter a stumbling block as they go through the journey but what matters is how they use the stumbling block to move forward.

These led to violent standoffs that resulted in hundreds injured from both police and protesters.Defending these tactics, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said that protesters overstepped, leaving cops with no choice but to fight back.""Sinadya 'nyo 'yan. Kayo naman ang unang nanakit. Kayo naman ang unang naging marahas, so wala kaming magagawa,"" Dela Rosa said in a news briefing.(You chose to do it. You were the first to hurt [the police] initiated the violence. You were the first ones to become violent, so we were left with no choice.)The most tense scuffle that ensued between police and protesters happened along Taft Avenue on Monday, November 13, as the ASEAN Summit officially opened a few kilometers away at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC).Police who responded to this demonstration were outnumbered as at least a thousand protesters attended the rally. (IN PHOTOS: At least 2,000 attend protests on day one of ASEAN Summit)At total of 123 activists were injured according to the Health Alliance for Democracy after the outnumbered cops used water cannons and truncheons against those who attempted to break the police barricade set up along the corner of Padre Faura Street and Taft Avenue.Around 20 other protesters and 20 cops were also injured earlier on Sunday, November 12, at Plaza Salamanca, a square near the US embassy, after demonstrators attempted to go nearer a zone marked off-limits to demonstrators.Arrest and casesPolice arrested a protester ""in the act of throwing stones at the rally near the US embassy on Sunday.Joint Task Group Peace and Order (JTG PO) representative Police Superintendent Ronald Hipolito said the protesters starting throwing stones despite them exercising maximum tolerance. They supposedly arrested Karapatan member Neil Legaspi, while the police were dispersing the violent crowd.Protesters, however, told a different story.According to Cristina Palabay, secretary general of Karapatan, Legaspi was driving the van owned by Karapatan for paralegal assistance during rallies when he was supposedly accosed by the police.Palabay said that Legaspi was forced out of the van, his hands handcuffed by two policemen  dentified by Karaptan as a certain PO1 Agcamanan and PO2 Bigcas of the Regional Public Safety Battalion, under the leadership of Task Force ASEAN.Police filed a case against Legaspi and two protest leaders  former Bayan Muna representative Teddy Casio and Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes  after the incident.The police complaint claimed that Casio, Reyes, and Legaspi violated the Public Assembly Act of 1985 by committing breach of peace, assault, and disobedience and resistance to authorities.Palabay downplayed these as nothing but trumped up charges.We are in fact mulling countercharges of carnapping and illegal search and seizure against CIDG operatives O. Silla, E. Ocampo, R. Siochi, J. Florendo, and Padua and TF ASEAN officials regarding this, Palabay said in a statement.On Tuesday, November 14, Legaspi was released by the police, with the charges against him referred for further preliminary investigation.Protest gimmicksThere was no shortage of protest gimmicks in the 6 days that activist groups claimed the streets to show their frustrations and dismay at the country's leaders who were meeting for the ASEAN Summit.

""In his own country, Trump has been described as fascist and has been blamed for the rise of neo-Nazi groups,"" Bayan said in a statement.On the last day of their protest, militant groups burned a modified US flag at Mendiola as they condemned the bilateral meeting between Trump and Duterte which they described as ""a sell-out of Filipinos.""At least 60,000 security personnel were deployed during the ASEAN Sumit.

0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,11688,11,1268,2599,28,"The Azkals are denied automatic qualification to the AFC Asian Cup after a fruitless 90 minutes on Tuesday. Here are the talking points.Published 4:20 PM, November 15, 2017Match highlights:The Philippines picked up a third Asian Cup qualifying draw in a row on Tuesday after the Group F encounter against Nepal in Kathmandu finished goalless. In our previous two matches we also shared points with Yemen twice via 2-2 and 1-1 scores.After we manhandled the Nepalese 4-1 at home in March, this seemed to be an easy three points for the Philippines. Get the W, pop the champagne, and start looking for cheap flights to Dubai in 2019, where the final stage will be held.But it just wasn't to be for Thomas Dooley's men on a difficult afternoon.As I feared, this match proved to be a stumbling blockBack in January when the draw for the qualifying came out, I wrote these words here in Rappler, lamenting what I saw as an unfortunate draw.The way I see it there was no harder Pot 4 away game than Nepal, and that is exactly what we landed. The altitude and the travel make this game a true banana skin. Almost every other Pot 4 away game would have been a short hop away at sea level against a beatable team. True, an away match at Bhutan would have also meant difficult travel and a match at high altitude, but the Bhutanese are probably weaker than Nepal.That was how I felt in January. Last weekend I wrote a preview to this game talking a lot about the altitude in Nepal, and two guys I really respect in Pinoy football, Mikee Carrion, (who was the match analyst on ABS-CBN S+A,) and ex-Kaya coach Maor Rozen, reassured me that it might not be an issue.Rozen told me that up to 1500 meters above sea level, there is really nothing much to worry about with pro athletes. It's only higher than that where things become difficult. Carrion said that in South America some visiting teams to high-altitude matches sometimes deliberately come a day before so that their body doesn't have time to notice the thin air.Plus the weather was startlingly balmy, around 21 degrees celsius at kickoff, 2:15 pm local time. The sun was out too. I guess autumns in Nepal are really pleasant most of the time.By kickoff I was really liking our chances. Conditions seemed perfect for us to win.But it wasn't to be. The ground looked very firm on TV, and we seemed to have difficulty controlling the weight of our passes and first touches in the thin air. Nepal looked very organized in the back and limited our chances.The Azkals were not afraid to press in the first half. Perhaps we paid for it with some tiredness in the second? I would love to ask the players.In the end, luck was not on our side as two chances were cleared off the line and Carlie De Murga's last-gasp header clanged off the woodwork.Misagh Bahadoran was not fielded, and that likely means he just didn't have the fitness in the eyes of Dooley to get a run-out. Curt Dizon did well up top, stinging the palms of the Nepalese goalie.So in the end, this did turn out to be a tough game. Nepal is 60 places below us on the FIFA rankings, and they had nothing else but pride to play for. But it didn't matter much as we just couldn't crack them.We were without some key cogs but for me there was one injured Azkal that we missed the most....We really needed Manny OttThe center of the park was not the creative engine it could have been on Tuesday. Paul Mulders, Phil Younghusband, and Kevin Ingreso were unable to rule the middle third. There were too main aimless direct balls.Manny Ott, Mike's kuya, is out for a few months with an injured knee. We sorely needed his composure, passing touch and vision. He is that rare player with the ability to read defenses and break them down.Here's hoping that the Ceres man somehow makes it back for the March game against Tajikistan, and that the other injured Azkal talisman, Javi Patio, is upfield to receive his passes.Let's take a look at where we standOn Tuesday night Yemen and Tajikistan played to a 0-0 draw as well in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. I see this as a good development because it keeps both sides below us in the standings.The Pinoys have 9 points after two wins and three draws to lead the group. Yemen and Tajikistan are at 7 points. Two-point Nepal are out of the running for UAE in 2019.The top two in the group progress. On March 27 we tangle with Tajikistan at home and Yemen and Nepal play in the last set of group games. I gather that the favorite to host the match is Panaad again, but there has been no official announcement yet.A win against Tajikistan and we are top of the group and punch tickets to UAE. A draw will be good enough too. That gives us 10 points, and leaves the Tajiks stuck at 8, safely below us. In that scenario, Tajikistan needs Nepal to beat Yemen to give the Central Asians passage.It is still possible for us to qualify even if we lose. That brings Tajikistan to 10 and leaves us at 9. Nepal needs to either draw or beat the Yemenis, though, for us to back into the final stage in 2019.The nightmare scenario is if we fall to Tajikistan and Yemen beats Nepal. That leaves us with 9 points, a point less than the other two and out of the AFC Asian Cup.But aside from that possibility we are actually still in good shape. This nil-nil may not satisfy, but it nudges us ever so closer to the promised land of UAE in 2019.With no more Azkals play for the rest of the year, we need to give the PFL a lookThe first Philippines Football League season is nearing the finish line.

They are not welcome here,"" Pedrosa added.A recent study published in June also found that Japan has the highest clean coal technology in the world. Last February, the Japanese government unveiled its plan to build up to 45 new coal fired power stations.Meanwhile, Trump, a known climate change denier, pulled out from the Paris climate accord for ""it does not serve American interests."" The move made the US the only country not to join the agreement.""Patuloy tayong niloloko ng gobyerno at ng malalaking bansa!

A United Nations report said that if humans do nothing to drastically cut down on fossil fuel energy sources, the Earth will be 3.7 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (C) warmer by 2100.Coal-fired power plants produce considerable amount of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change.

I thought we were going to die so I told my mother to pray the rosary. As soon as we finished praying, two workers of Roger Lo, the owner of RL Appliance Incorporated, came to rescue us.God works in mysterious ways, and truly, ""the family that prays together, stays together.""Four years after Haiyan, we have completely recovered and rebuilt our home, Tacloban City, with the help of people around the world. We became more resilient, practical, and more appreciative of what we have. Each day is another chance to correct our mistakes so always try to be better. Life is short.Aaron JP Almadro, editor-in-chief of 8 Magazine and marketing manager of Nissan/BAIC/Chevrolet Tacloban The whole experience was hard to forget: the howling winds, the destruction of our house, the torment of thinking if you would survive. But what almost pushed me to the brink was finding my parents dead  my mom on the street with her face covered with a rubber tire interior, and my dad on the floor of their hotel room with blood coming out of his mouth. There were two phases in my life after Yolanda. In 2014, I was angry, hateful, vengeful, skeptical, selfish, and doubtful. But after I met the Pope and I had a heart attack in 2015, my life took a 180-degree turn. I realized the beauty of life. Now, I'm stronger, fearless, and optimistic. Winfred, former overseas Filipino worker I went around the city on a borrowed mountain bike the day after the typhoon hit. The destruction was everywhere. The streets in some of the hardest-hit areas had numerous bodies left on the side of the road, unclaimed. The feeling of shock and hopelessness was all too pervasive  one only needed to look at the faces of the survivors walking on the road to see this. An experience like Yolanda makes you realize a lot of things: the importance of family and friends, the lengths people will go to keep their loved ones safe, the kindness of strangers. An experience like this will also make you see the ugly side of human nature. However, it can also show you the nobility, compassion, and decency of the human spirit. There were people who chose to stand strong for the community and for the city, people who volunteered, people who chose to help relatives, friends, and even strangers despite their own losses. I hope that most people can look back and say that despite the tragedy that visited their lives they did something that they can be proud of. If not, then I hope that one learns from the examples shown by those who did. Maria Angela, businesswoman My most vivid memory of the typhoon that still reminds me of how catastrophic it was: I was walking from my hotel going to Anibong, near the coastal area that was hit badly, where our building was located. I felt it was the longest walk I had ever taken. My heart was racing with every step I took towards the building. I saw a few corpses on the way. At that time, I didn't know what I would see inside our building. I was fearing for the lives of people who stayed there during the typhoon.",Super Typhoon Yolanda survivors look back 4 years later

Deaths could have been averted if the consequences of a storm surge were properly explained to the public, forecasters said.It was a lesson that cost thousands of lives.Back to basicsUnderstanding the scientific jargon behind these phenomena is a challenge, especially to journalists not trained in the sciences.But we try. We spend hours of research, training, and practice to be able to translate the jargon into something easier to understand.Attention to disseminating information about risks and hazards has been the priority of Rappler, not only for typhoons or earthquakes, but for other natural or man-made emergencies as well.The harsh lessons of Yolanda pushed us to make information related to disaster-preparedness, response, and recovery more easily understood by the public.We created a platform that overlays on a map relevant information such as hazards, evacuation centers, and police posts among others. This platform is called Agos which crowdsources online reports to connect those in need.As a newbie journalist who covered the disaster beat, churning out knowledge pieces and running after local government officials for their disaster management plans were part of the day to day.We try to combine the hard facts with creative storytelling to engage the reader.Part of our coverage included discussing the impact of the ""Big One""  a 7.2-magnitude earthquake  that could happen when the West Valley Fault Line moves. We published interactive quizzes for the public to easily test if their house can withstand major earthquakes.We also saw the importance of reminding the public about events such as the sinking of M/V Princess of the Stars or the eruption of Mt Pinatubo to prevent a repeat.Efficient governanceBut all these boil down to governance.Years have passed since Yolanda struck the country and still, many communities affected by the typhoon have yet to return to their normal lives.There was a ""mismatch"" in resettlement requirements as estimated by the housing agencies. Four years later, the backlog in housing is still an issue.The Yolanda rehabilitation experience is not an isolated case. The country experiences an average of 20 typhoons and a couple of earthquakes a year, but reconstruction lags behind.Officials say that it could be attributed to a lack of budget or capacity to implement projects.That's why we continue to watch. We continue to write. When it comes to rehabilitation, we follow the money trail. We demand accountability.In Rappler, we don't cover disasters only as they happen.

From 2013 to 2015, Japanese FDI within the region amounted to $19.2 billion, or 15.4% of total inbound investment in the market. This also represents 16.7% of Japans total overseas investment.Over the last two decades, just as Japan has increased its trade ties with ASEAN member countries, investment into Japan from Southeast Asian based companies has increased. Opportunities in the Japanese market across a range of industries continue to attract investment from our neighbors, says Masataka Fujita, Secretary General, of the ASEAN Promotion Centre on Trade, Investment and Tourism (ASEAN-Japan Centre). We intend to work even closer with our friends across the region to encourage business partnerships, trade and investment.The Philippines has been particularly cited to be an important consumer market for Japan, due to our young, educated population.Japanese companies invest heavily in production value-chain projects and electronic, automotive, and chemical industries within the region.

Members of his Cabinet could be seen behind him smiling at the remark, so characteristic of the President.At the ASEAN-Korea Summit later that day, Duterte said he is forced by protocol to respectfully, most respectfully request the media to disappear, eliciting some laughter from reporters watching his speech from the International Media Center at the Manila World Trade Center.After his opening remarks at the ASEAN-Canada Summit on Wednesday, Duterte phrased his request with the help of one of his favorite Bible verses, Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.It is said that there is always a time for everything under the sun. And I am addressing it to the media. A time to join and a time to not join, he said.At a later Wednesday summit, Duterte changed his tone, saying he, in fact, wanted media to stay for the entire meeting but had to abide by the dictates of the organizing committee.Im sorry, but if I had my way, Id invite you to participate. But the problem is the working papers, and this is not my words, our open session ends here, he told the media.He repeated this tone at the East Asia Summit.I know that you like it here. I want you to participate. The problem is, the working papers of the Secretariat do not like you, he said.He didnt stop there. Instead of keeping the customary dismissal of media short and sweet, Duterte continued playfully, Its not us. We love exposures to media. We are almost all politicians here. But the Secretariat is stiff.His colorful way of asking the media to leave the meetings began with his bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump.After a reporter tried to ask Trump about whether he would bring up human rights violations with Duterte, the Philippine President said the media better leave so the two of them can talk more comfortably about sensitive issues.""We would be talking on matters that [are] of interest [to] both the Philippines and [the US]. With you around, guys, you are the spies,"" said Duterte.Thanks to the mediaBut before the ASEAN Summit's events were over, Duterte acknowledged the work of journalists who covered the international conference.In his last ASEAN press conference on Tuesday night, he said, ""I wish to express my appreciation to the members of the media for your coverage throughout the year of the Philippines chairmanship of ASEAN.""Describing media as ""invaluable partners"" in raising awareness about ASEAN, Duterte told the roomful of reporters and cameramen, ""I thank you for getting that message across to the public.""The fiery Philippine leader has a complicated relationship with reporters, aware of their power to record his deeds as part of history but also smarting from their criticism of him and his administration.He has launched insults and threats to certain media organizations and journalists but has also invited members of the press to Malacaang dinners.

Latest ""official"" data from the Philippine National Police (PNP) shows that at least 3,850 people have been killed in police operations, while at least 2,290 others were killed mostly by unknown vigilantes.But Duterte has consistently responded with threats, while invoking Philippine independence  whether to slap or place on the immigration blacklist individuals who dare criticize his campaign.

The large media center, usually uncrowded, was filled to the brim. Seats were not just taken up by media, but by volunteers and government officials as well.The guest in question? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.But what raised eyebrows in particular were the government officials who fawned over the world leader like he was a member of a boyband.During his scheduled press conference at the ASEAN International Media Center, the Presidential Communications Group was in full force as they welcomed Trudeau. Trudeau is often talked about on social media because of his charisma and good looks.Officials  such as Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, along with Presidential Communications Operations Office Assistant Secretaries Mia Reyes, Ana Marie Banaag and Department of Public Works and Highways Karen Jimeno  were all present in the centers main briefing room.Chairs reserved for Andanars family members were also spotted among the VIP seats.Seats were interspersed with journalists and PCOO officials, who were suddenly present in the room.

But when he did arrive, smartphones became suddenly visible as those in the room started snapping photos.When the dashing Canadian leader went up the stage, squeals were heard from the audience. Phones of VIPs, staff and journalists, pointed toward the Prime Minister for the first few minutes of his press briefing.But it was when Trudeau left the stage and finished his briefing that all hell broke loose.Trudeau exited through the left side of the hall.

Kayo na ang magdugtong (You fill in the blanks), he said in a post.The police chief did the ""Duterte fist pump"" while Trump, who had earlier been cautioned about using the gesture, flashed a thumbs-up instead  a hand gesture he usually does.Dela Rosa did not say when the photos were taken but they were presumably snapped the same day Trump met with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte during a bilateral meeting on November 13.The PNP chief is among the key personalities in Dutertes drug war. Police have been at the forefront of the drug war since it was launched in July 2016 up until they were ordered out of it by Duterte himself in October 2017. Police spearheaded efforts to catch top drug personalities, as well as programs to make alleged drug users and pushers surrender"".Along with this huge role came allegations that police resorted to extralegal means in the name of the anti-illegal drugs campaign. Dela Rosa has denied allegations of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings by police.During the bilateral meeting, Duterte and Trump underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs to promote the welfare of all sectors, including the most vulnerable groups, said a joint statement released by the two countries. (IN PHOTOS: Budding friendship between Trump and Duterte)The two leaders did not directly mention human rights concerns in the context of the drug war.

And I am not kidding. Her death affects me in a very peculiar way.That we belong to the same age group is not really what bothers me. I am feeling a bit bad because I had never paid attention to her when I was all about That's Entertainment in the 80s. There was nothing to dislike about her except that in the 80s, too, it was not very cool to be trying too hard in school. And I felt like she had the effect of being that person who tries to too hard.I remember having a conversation with my cousin about why Melissa Gibbs is more appealing because she would always make it appear like shes got better things to do than to be singing or dancing in front of an audience. Her body language would always almost read: This is so baduy (in bad taste) but what the heck, here we go...""Her reluctance was so appealing. Her superb singing voice was elevated by her cool demeanor. Each performance was rendered with effortless perfection, even her reading from a long list of sponsors was just so attractively ambivalent. She definitely marked a distance between her and her very own performances. She was graceful yet so not invested.Isabel Granada would be the opposite. She always gave it her all. She was too earnest for comfort. There was no distance between her and a pop tune, it was almost ridiculous. Her sacred seriousness was almost alienating. She never made it to the headlines of nasty gossip shows as she was perhaps friends with everyone.One might question how deep those friendships were as they must have been devoid of an other or an ""enemy"" that keeps friendships solid and real. And it is all because Isabel Granada did not look like she was interested in marking people as her enemies. She did not have time for that. Her time did look like it was divided between performing and practicing for those performances. She was just there anywhere and everywhere where compulsion reigns.So we were not just into her, this Hispanic looking actor who also seemed to represent all too Pinoy values. But not until a couple of years back. Pinoy showbiz would feature her in the most provocative way: ""Must see! Isabel Granada beauty and body still explosive after all these years."" She created a stir, and it is all true. She embodied what is required of women who are just about ""to let go of themselves.""Contempt against womenIf you are a woman of Granada's age (40s), misogyny or that ingrained contempt and prejudice against women demands that you constantly look like you are just about to turn 18.So for the past few years, what Granada was for women who paid attention to her re-entry into showbiz is a symbol that amplifies an effective value. This is the value of looking like a young girl in middle age. This is not an obsession of women in general but it certainly affects most in the middle and upper classes.In a way, Granada as a symbol also became a replacement for a commitment to looking like a young girl. It is actually less an addiction to a physical regiment that could actually make one look like a young girl than a fascination for Granada's ways and means to ""stay young and attractive."" All of which are on YouTube and her personal Instagram account.Despite her death, Granada continues to play a role in what seems to be a contradictory phenomenon of being addicted to another person.Living the gameWhat the Marxist-Lacanian philosopher Slavoj Zizek would call interpassive delegated addiction is clearly explained by another philosopher in the same tradition, Robert Pfaller. Pfaller points to substitute activities or interpassive practices - such as bibliomania, photocopying, collecting video recordings as forms of addiction that rest on the principle of play (115).These interpassive practices are also called substitute activities because they function as ""symbolic, protective measures, (which) serve to overcome an impulse of hatred towards something that is outwardly loved but latently hated (115). Obsessive-compulsive photocopying, video copying, book-buying function to keep at bay the rising displeasure for reading, consuming television, and so on.We are supposed to maintain a positive attitude toward keeping fit and healthy through the consumption of organic meatless food and a focused and efficient workout. ""Just do it,"" is Nike's command. Following celebrities like Granada on social media helps us through it all.This act of following social media accounts of beauty and fitness icons is an activity that interpassives love to stage in order to postpone or avoid carrying out what is to be done to actually look fit and young.I personally feel ambivalent about this particular activity. On one level, I feel frustrated for wasting away time watching ""explosive beauties"" instead of actually turning myself into one, which is too insane of a secret wish to mention. On another level, and definitely on a higher plane of intellectual and political maturity, I do think that to make myself valuable under the system of capital is the height of misadventure, and thus delinking from the capitalist value chain is the goal. Of course, doing nothing and eating everything will not cut anyone off from participating in all that capitalist and crisis-driven spiraling.In all this, I only think it is fair to remember Isabel Granada, the earnest and invested young girl who, to some people's delight and dismay, turned herself into a young girl yet again in her late adult years.Yes, misogynys prescription for women to look perpetually young and attractive has resulted in an addiction. And some of you might have already heard about how psychoanalysis characterizes addiction as a form of play. Yet Granada did not look like she was addicted to this play. She lived the game. - Rappler.comSarah Raymundo is an assistant professor at the Center for International Studies, University of the Philippines-Diliman.

As we lead this years special ASEAN Summit, we might ask ourselves: How can we bolster our shaky standing in the region?Published 12:01 PM, November 13, 2017This year were hosting the ASEAN Summit for the third time ever, and also on ASEANs 50th founding anniversary.Its therefore as good a time as any to step back, take stock of our place in the region, and examine how we have progressed compared to our neighbors.A good way to do this is by comparing average incomes across ASEAN countries, noting that income is one of the best  albeit imperfect  ways to measure and compare peoples well-being.Figure 1 below compares the GDP (or gross domestic product) per person across all ASEAN member-countries and across time. This graph speaks volumes.First, while ASEAN countries are generally becoming richer over time, some have advanced faster than others.The Philippines rate of progress, in particular, has been embarrassingly slow. With the exception of Brunei and Singapore, the Philippines used to lead the pack in the 1950s. But Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia have long overtaken us: Malaysia in 1968, Thailand in 1984, Indonesia in 1989.Fast forward to 2014 (when the latest comparable data is available), only the CLMV countries  Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam  are poorer than us. But remarkably, their incomes have caught up so fast that they are soon poised to match Filipinos income levels (Viet Nam may have even already overtaken us).Many say that the Philippines is the fastest-growing economy in ASEAN today. But in truth, that distinction belongs to Myanmar. In fact, its the fastest-growing economy in the world. From 2010 to 2014, GDP per person in Myanmar grew at 7.2% per year on average; in the Philippines, it grew at only 4.6%.For the greater part of the 20th century, Myanmar was indeed the poorest in ASEAN. But by 2014, the average Burmese is richer than the average Cambodian, and is now nearly as rich as the average Vietnamese or Lao.What explains this remarkable turnaround? The gradual return of democratic institutions and economic openness partly explain Myanmars impressive rise from the doldrums. But starting from such a low base also explains much of its recent growth (also called base effect).Wasted opportunitiesThe Philippines, once the leader in the region, is now the follower. Whos to blame for the countrys lackluster performance?Many scholars have looked into this, and one common theme emerging from the corpus of research is this: a combination of external factors and bad domestic policies  compounded by President Marcos corrupt and debt-driven leadership  set us up for failure.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ASEAN countries faced much the same external shocks that led to economic troubles  oil price hikes from OPEC and a US recession that raised world interest rates and reduced export demand.But only in the Philippines did these external factors result in a permanently lower income growth trajectory, commencing in the 1983 debt crisis. This recession  the deepest since WWII  is manifested in the dip of income per capita you see around 1983.Back in the 1960s, however, the income path of the Philippines was already flatter than that of other ASEAN countries, especially Malaysia and Thailand.During this time, our neighbors pursued export-oriented industrialization. But Filipino leaders at the time focused too much on promoting domestic production in whats called import substitution industrialization. In short, this means we boosted local firms output and protected them from foreign competition, in the hopes that they would develop their own production capabilities and technologies.But instead, our industries got used to very high levels of government support and protection and failed to mature vis--vis their ASEAN counterparts.This pattern was largely continued (and exacerbated) during the Marcos regime, whose crony capitalism  characterized by the proliferation of monopolies, special privileges, and damaged institutions  further removed businesses incentives to be efficient and productive, leading to the stagnation of manufacturing.All in all, decades of bad economic policies and politics brought the country down. Using statistical techniques, Manuel Albis and I showed in a previous article that Filipinos couldve been much richer now had we just followed the growth patterns seen in the rest of ASEAN. (READ: Were it not for Marcos, Filipinos today would have been richer)New challengesUnless the Duterte government implements crucial reforms today  especially in foreign investments  our place in ASEAN will continue to be imperiled.Investments drive future growth. But the data show that the Philippines investment rate has been historically low, owing in no small measure to our similarly low saving rate and the many restrictions that have diminished our attractiveness as an investment destination.Vietnam is becoming an increasingly important competitor for foreign direct investments (FDI). Members of the South Korean Chamber of Commerce, for example, are reportedly moving to Vietnam because doing business there is around two-thirds less costly than in the Philippines.A recent survey also revealed that US companies are choosing to expand their businesses mostly in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Indonesia. The Philippines is near the bottom of their priority list (see Figure 2).Our lacking infrastructure is a major investment turnoff. In the latest Global Competitiveness Report, the Philippines lags behind the rest of ASEAN in terms of the quality of roads, railroads, ports, air transport, and electricity supply. (In fact, we scored worst on roads and air transport.)Aside from infrastructure, investors are also looking closely at prospective growth: they want to invest wherever growth is expected to be faster, not slower.But the 2017 growth forecasts for the Philippines have been dropping in recent months, and converging toward the low end of the government forecast (see Figure 3). Among other things, this is on account of the slower-than-expected rollout of Build, Build, Build.Way forwardCompared to our ASEAN neighbors, the Philippines has treaded on a deviant growth path. Now, our poorer neighbors are growing faster than us. As we lead this years special ASEAN Summit, we might ask ourselves: How can we bolster our shaky standing in the region?In a sense, the answers are already staring us in the face: we need to step up our investment and infrastructure game  fast.Although the Duterte economic managers are working hard on this, they have their work cut out for them. Business confidence is at a 3-year low and 52% of surveyed US businesses thought the current administration is ineffective in boosting business confidence and promoting investment.The least we can do now is to do business as usual, and not make matters worse. But if our aim is to regain our economic leadership in the region, its clear that this alone will hardly suffice.

But the day it acquires that too much economic weight for comfort  with handy geopolitical weapon to boot  may not be that far away in the horizon.How it turns out depends on factors that bear watching  the pace and depth of ASEAN countries' regional integration efforts and diversification of its economic relationships, China's calibration of the ""quality"" of its economic engagement in the region and its trust deficit, and ASEAN societies' response to China's style of economic cooperation.Recent analyses make the case for why ASEAN's 10 member countries need to work on deepening trade and investment ties among themselves  for their own economic resilience and to maintain precious elbow room in international relations given the likelihood that China will use its economic weight in the pursuit of strategic interests in issues such as the South China Sea disputes.At present, China is more of a trade power than it is a major player in foreign direct investments (FDI) in the ASEAN region, according to a paper published this month by the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.""Although China has leverage in terms of trade, its investments are yet to catch up with those from other developed countries. China can therefore not really as yet be called a dominant economic power in Southeast Asia,"" said the paper by Sanjita Basu Das, lead researcher for economic affairs at the ASEAN Studies Center, ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. ""However, as China increases its outbound investments and completes more infrastructure projects, its geopolitical influence in the region will definitely increase.""""One cannot conclude outright that China is a dominant economic power in Southeast Asia for FDI, which one can do when it comes to trade,"" Das explained. ""Apart from the less developed ASEAN members  Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar  Beijing is not really capable of holding ASEAN countries hostage economically to advance its strategic demands.""Danger: OverdependenceIn recent years, ASEAN countries have become much more trade dependent on China. All member economies except Singapore have trade deficits with the world's largest trading nation, meaning they rely on China for much of their imports, ASEAN data show.The volume of ASEAN-China trade stood at $345 billion in 2015, the second largest after the $543-billion volume of intra-ASEAN trade. After China came ASEAN's trade with Japan, the European Union and the United States, with trade volumes of more than $200 billion. China has been ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009.From 2005 to 2015, China's trade with ASEAN grew by the largest margin  13.2%  among its trade partners. South Korea-ASEAN trade grew by 10.9% over the same period, but ASEAN's trade with the EU, Japan, and the US grew only by 5.4%, 5%, and 3.6%, respectively.In other words, ""the weight of advanced economies in ASEAN's total trade has been declining, while that of China's is on the rise,"" wrote Das. ""As multinational firms undertook single production processes across multiple countries over the last few decades, China and ASEAN economies have become intertwined in a web of regional production networks, thus increasing their mutual dependence.""In terms of FDI, China still lags behind intra-ASEAN investments, which made up 18% of total FDI flows in the region, and those of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. However, the growth rate of FDI inflows into ASEAN in 2005-2015 reached 33.4% from China and 30.3% from South Korea.Likewise, given China's strategic push in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar and the sharp rise in its own outward investments, it is a much bigger investor there than it is in other ASEAN countries. China is the largest source of foreign investments in Cambodia and Laos. As of end-2016, it accounted for close to 35% of Cambodia's FDI. In Lao PDR, China's accumulated investments exceeded $6 billion in 2016.Overall, the more diversified mix of FDI in ASEAN means that there is no one single dominant source of investments for the region, one that can only be good for ASEAN's economic health. The US is a leading investor in the Philippines and Malaysia, but the EU leads in Singapore. Japan is a major investor in Thailand and Indonesia, while South Korea is the one in Vietnam and Malaysia, as Das' paper shows.China's growing economic footprint brings with it a new appreciation for the progress ASEAN has made  though it could be deeper  in relying more on its own members through regional economic integration over the past 5 decades.ASEAN countries are a key source of investments among themselves, particularly in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. But China's growing FDI in the region may actually be bigger, if one considers the fact that Hong Kong is a gateway for investment in the region.As China's FDI outflows pick up  partly due to its search for overseas destinations to invest overcapacity in steel and cement  these investment figures look certain to go up in ASEAN. ""Moreover, given the huge demand for infrastructure financing among the Southeast Asian countries and China's indifferent attitude towards political systems and human rights, the quantum of investment flows could grow considerably,"" Das said.Chinese infrastructure engagement is expected to grow, given its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) Initiative and funding through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and cooperation funds with ASEAN. These come with Chinese workers, equipment, and construction materials that have not met with wholesale optimism in countries like Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, or Malaysia because they do not provide local jobs or skills transfer, among others.China needs to be sensitive as well to the ""soft"" side of the impact of its economic presence in investments, trade or aid  and where it may well have a learning curve as a regional power compared to, say, the longer involvements of Japan or the United States in the region.What, then, can ASEAN do? ""To mitigate the risks, the ASEAN countries must strengthen their own economic integration,"" Das wrote. While ASEAN member countries are ""already prominent trade and investment partners among themselves,"" they need to put in place cross-border policies that keep foreign investors coming.""In addition, the ASEAN countries must diversify their trading basket across major economies,"" she pointed out. Among others, ASEAN and EU may be restarting talks over an ASEAN-EU free trade agreement, previously stalled by human rights issues over Myanmar.One major way would be for ASEAN to speed up completion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), one of ASEAN's deliverables during its 50th anniversary this year. But however much analysts say it is virtually the only regional economic game in town  with the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) far from being a trade negotiating forum  RCEP is nowhere near completion.After 19 rounds of negotiations as of July this year, ASEAN-led RCEP discussions have become caught in differences over tariff reduction offers, the degree of liberalization in services and the movement of professionals, reflecting the challenge of building what is to be the largest trade deal encompassing nearly half of the world's population, 30% of global income, and 30% of global trade.When it does bring together ASEAN and its 6 existing trade agreement partners  Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea  RCEP would be ""the most important example of ASEAN Centrality and its benefits for ASEAN states,"" pointed out Malcolm Cook and Das in an October paper on ""RCEP's Strategic Opportunity.""If RCEP gets completed in 2018, the ratification process would likely take one year so implementation would start earliest in 2020, the paper added.ASEAN countries are well aware that putting too many eggs in China's basket opens them to bullying if Beijing chooses to push economic diplomacy and use its economic power in the geopolitical sphere.Das' paper has a reminder of how South Korea got a taste of ""economic retribution"" when earlier in 2017, China punished it for its installation of the US missile defense system THAAD. China's increased scrutiny of South Korea's Lotte Mart led to the closure of most of its stores in China, whose government also advised Chinese tour groups to stay away.Economics is politics, tooWhile ASEAN states are drawn to easier access to China's funds, ""the OBOR Initiative has fueled concern among many Southeast Asia countries about the security risks of economic overdependence on China,"" said a November paper on ""Infrastructure Connectivity and Regional Economic Integration in East Asia: Progress and Challenges,"" published by the Lee Kwan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. ""Hence, Southeast Asian countries are cautious [about] becoming economically over-dependent on China as they fear being forced to adopt a pro-China foreign policy stance.""Given China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, Das wrote: ""If the maritime disputes remain unresolved, Beijing may be tempted to use its economic leverage to advance its strategic objectives in the SCS and beyond. It may also try to own infrastructure assets in ASEAN to service its national interests.""This may be similar to China's investment in Sri Lanka's strategic Hambatota port, which has come under scrutiny as a brand of China's economic presence. China is involved in huge infrastructure projects in ASEAN, such as the construction of the Vientiane-Kunming railway.""China's perceived assertiveness in foreign policy, particularly in relation to territorial disputes in the South and East China Sea, is unfortunately helping to create a negative state image for China abroad,"" said the LKY School of Public Policy paper on infrastructure in East Asia.""This is not supportive of China's ambition to be perceived as a responsible and friendly power in the region and beyond.""

It's also a movie commemorating the anime's 20th anniversary.But there was one big change from the anime series that blew fans' minds away more than that time everyone went crazy for Pokmon Go: Pikachu spoke.The yellow critter spoke  and not in the way we've been used to. It spoke in plain English.In the scene, as Ash starts to faint, he asks Pikachu why it won't go back to its Pokball. Pikachu has always been known for being sort of a rebel this way: it doesn't stay in its Pokball like most of its other ilk do. Now we finally have an answer why.Responding to Ash, Pikachu says, in its sweetest voice, ""It's because I always want to be with you."" Yup.How are people reacting?

It was a good thing that he was able to do so quickly, as Pepe is reportedly faring better than he did during the first stroke which happened on April 2015 and left the musician with a minor speech impediment. The second stroke took place July last year.He has difficulty swallowing, but he can talk. He is conscious.

The analysis suggested the tweets were viewed hundreds of millions of times.The research paper tracked 156,252 Russian accounts that mentioned #Brexit in original posts or retweets. Of these, a prolific account called Stormbringer15 was considered by experts as almost certainly a Russian troll factory creation.""Sowing discordThe tweets were apparently meant to create tension in the country, with most tweets encouraging a vote for Brexit, while a lesser number were pro-Remain.

(READ: More governments manipulate media with 'bots,' trolls  study)Not as free as beforeCountries were rated based on obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of human rights. Higher ratings denoted less freedom in a specific category, with 0 being the most free and 100 being the least free.The Philippines still enjoys ""free"" status in terms of internet freedom with an overall score of 28, but it is less free in 2017 compared to last year, when it got a score of 26.Obstacles to internet accessThe Philippines' internet penetration and average internet connection speeds improved in 2017. It must be remembered, however, that while the speeds have increased slightly, the Philippines does not rank highly in terms of either 4G LTE speeds or general broadband speeds.Also pointed out in the report was the National Broadband Plan, which aims to expand internet connectivity by 2020, as well as bring more affordable connectivity to people using new technologies and infrastructure building.Instances of the National Telecommunications Commission ordering shutdowns of cellular phone signals for connectivity were also an issue. This was done in Manila, Cebu, and Iloilo in January.Additionally, the Philippines also lacked competition to drive down prices and improve service. The landscape is ""dominated by PLDT and Globe who both have acquired a number of minor players in the last two decades.""Limits on contentIn terms of limits on content, Freedom House said, ""No systematic government censorship of online content has been documented in the Philippines, and internet users enjoyed unrestricted access to both domestic and international sources of information during the coverage period of this report."" It also added that the government does not normally request for content to be removed.It did note, however, that rare content blocks existed, such as the blocking of some pornographic sites in the country.Aside from the ""keyboard army"" in the section on ""Media, Diversity and Content Manipulation,"" one additional entry was posted: allowing pro-administration bloggers to cover Palace events and the subsequent discussion of a creation of a code of conduct for bloggers.Outside the scope of Freedom House's report, it can be argued that the pro-administration bloggers also hold additional power as part of the Presidential Communication Operations Office (PCOO). In November, PCOO Assistant Secretary Esther Margaux ""Mocha"" Uson asked her boss, Secretary Martin Andanar, to reclassify news organization Rappler as part of the social media category under her purview. (FACT CHECK: Can PCOO reclassify Rappler as 'Social Media' under Uson?)""Generally, though, the Philippine blogosphere is rich and thriving,"" Freedom House said.Violations of user rightsThe Philippines' lowest ranking  a score of 13  was on violations of user rights.The report explained that the country had 494 complaints of online libel, with some cases resulting in imprisonment. The rush of online libel complaints stemmed from a Supreme Court ruling in favor of punishing online libel under the Cybercrime Prevention Act.Lawmakers, meanwhile, revisited a draft law that would require telecommunications providers to register prepaid SIM card owners, though this had not gone beyond first reading.While there were no reports of physical violence targeting internet users during the period covered by the report, violence against journalists, either as threat or as action, is still a problem in the country.Explained Freedom House, ""As of early 2017, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that at least 78 Philippine journalists had been killed in relation to their work  most covering political issues like corruption  since 1992.""The culture of impunity remains an issue, the message being individuals exercising free speech can be attacked at will. In his first press conference a month before being sworn in, President Rodrigo Duterte said corrupt journalists deserved to be killed.Duterte has since continued to accuse journalists of unfair reporting, and in recent days  specifically during a meeting with US President Donald Trump  called journalists ""spies.""Technological attacks against journalist institutions have also been a problem.The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism's website was defaced by hackers in 2016 following reports on Duterte's war on drugs. The PCIJ noted that ""a phrase with explicit curse and threat has been written by the attackers into our stories.""The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, meanwhile, faced a ""massive denial of service attack"" in January 2017.Read the full Freedom on the Net 2017 report here.

The 3500 square-meter property has over 20,000 beds of oyster mushrooms.The mushrooms are cultivated, harvested, refrigerated, and preserved using scientifically-based processes, as they will usually only remain fresh for a day. This also encouraged the owners to explore more ways of preserving and processing the harvested mushrooms.Lilets now offers a wide array of processed mushroom products, from dried mushrooms, lumpia mushrooms, and pickled mushrooms, to mushroom siomai and sweetened mushrooms. The products are sold all over Region 6.Located just beside the Antique Provincial Capitol, Lilets has a pop-up kiosk where they sell their products. You can try their mushroom burger and mushroom chicharon for a healthy snack while enjoying the al fresco set-up.Their double-patty mushroom burger costs P85 while the single patty goes for P65. You can also buy their crunchy chicharon (P50), which is best partnered with their spicy sinamak.Leo's Homemade Ice CreamThe Palaro heat is on, and with local temperatures soaring high, no food is as comforting as a cone of homemade ice cream.Leos Homemade Ice Cream has been one of Antiques favorite ice cream parlors for over 4 years now.Each ice cream flavor is crafted with locally sourced fruits and ingredients like pandan, banana, langka, buko, and avocado. They also have flavors like peanut butter, oreo mint, and buko salad.You can get 2 scoops for P10, while a gallon for sharing costs P450. Local delicacies such as butterscotch, barquillos, and otap can also be added as toppings.JB's Chicken InatoCoconut is one of the main products that Antique exports, and its no wonder that its also integrated into most of their local recipes.JBs Chicken Inato offers all things with, and served in, buko (coconut).Batchoy is a staple in Panay, but buko batchoy is Antiques version with a twist.On top of the handmade round noodles, pork organs, beef loin, and chicken broth, JBs buko batchoy is cooked with buko juice and meat. This gives a sweet flavor to the usual tangy taste of batchoy, the buko meat compliments the noodles, and it's all served inside a fresh buko shell.Chicken Binakol is another homegrown recipe. Made with broiled chicken, lemongrass, ginger, sili leaves, buko juice and meat, binakol is a savory chicken dish that works well as a viand or soup.A buko batchoy costs P88 while a serving of Chicken Binakol costs P160.Of course, JB's also has their version of the Philippines most loved dessert, halo-halo. While each region has theirs, this one from Antique is made with shaved frozen coconut juice instead of regular ice, and is topped with fruits and made sweeter with muscovado sugar.Antique,with all its old-world charm, is a melting pot of gastronomic delights.

So its no surprise that the average Filipino farmer is 57 years old, with younger generations opting out of farming in pursuit of a ""better life"" elsewhere.This is why Cherrie Atilano is pushing to make farming ""cool, smart, and humane.""Growing up in a farm in Negros Occidental, Atilano started her advocacy in agriculture when she was 12 years old.""It pains me everytime I talk to our farmers. We ask them if they have bank account or if they have a notion of having a bank account. They think it's just for rich people. They don't have any concept of saving,"" Atilano said.Farming has been a neglected sector by the government for decades, Atilano added. There is much work to be done in empowering farmers and farming communities.""Agriculture was the Philippines' backbone before. But along the way, it was somehow forgotten. I always say that agriculture in the Philippines is politicized. We measure the yield of crops but we dont really measure the impact on the farmers lives,"" she said.Atilano added: ""The government should really focus on building this backbone. Because agriculture is a huge industry. When you plant rice, it is a plant industry. You know, when you plant coffee, it can be a coffee industry. When you plant cotton, of course, our clothing comes from cotton. You know when you plant a cacao, it will be a chocolate industry.""Agriculture for millennialsAtilano started AGREA (agriculture and Gaea), a social enterprise that hopes to empower farmers and get more people to start farming. Its goal is three-fold: to eradicate poverty for farming and fishing families, to mitigate the effects of climate change, and to establish food security in the Philippines.""We believe in Agrea that everything we do is about cultivation of human beings. Thats why it took us a while to do a lot of community organizing with our farming communities...We do sustainable agricultural practices so the farmers can be resilient even if there are typhoons or floods that may come. But more than that our goal for them is to really be financially literate,"" she said.Currently, their efforts are focused in Marinduque  one of the poorest provinces in the entire archipelago due to decades of mining. By implementing a one-island economy model, AGREA hopes to ensure foood security for and mitigate environmental and social impacts on the community.If the model becomes successful, Atilano plans to replicate it in other parts of the country.The work is not easy but Atilano says it's worth it.""I think, going out of your comfort zone is the most comfortable thing in life. Its the most comfortable zone in life that you can experience, Atilano said.She added that millennials need to commit to their passions and advocacies in order to make them work.""Many young people, theyre so passionate in things. But when it demands more sacrifices, it demands more going out of your comfort zone, its so easy for them to give up,"" she said.Atilano added: ""The world needs sustainable nurturers. Nurturers that could endure the problems in our society. That could always see opportunities out of these problems. And for me, for those millennials, it is really more on investing on, sacrificing for what you love to do.""This is why Atilano was named Earth Mover for the Move Awards 2016. Her work shows that farming can be a friendly, sustainable, and lucrative profession.  Rappler.com",WATCH: Making agriculture a viable career for millennials

Local militants and groups such as Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. It was they who cruelly murdered our countryman Bernard Then on Tuesday.

We must not lose sight of the fact that the ideology itself must be exposed as the lie that it is, and vanquished for it is not Islamic. It cannot be.From security issues, the discussion at ASEAN will turn to economics on day two as the leaders endorse the regional integration by year-end.But with Aquino, the US, Japan and even India putting the sea row squarely on the agenda, the pressure is on China to ensure that its rhetoric on regional peace matches its actions on the ground and at sea.Ayee Macaraig, Rappler, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Rappler.com",VLOG: Aquino blasts China at ASEAN summit

As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.""Moyo said: ""This is not a military takeover of government"".But the generals' actions posed a major challenge to the 93-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980.Neighboring South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, one of Mugabe's closest allies, said he had spoken to the veteran leader by telephone.Mugabe ""indicated that he was confined to his home but said that he was fine,"" the South African government said in a statement that called for calm and restraint.Tensions between Mugabe and the military establishment, which has long helped prop up his authoritarian rule, erupted in public over recent weeks.The ruling ZANU-PF party on Tuesday, November 14, accused army chief General Constantino Chiwenga of ""treasonable conduct"" after he criticized Mugabe for sacking vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa.Government silenceMnangagwa's dismissal left Mugabe's wife Grace, 52, in prime position to succeed her husband as the next president  a succession strongly opposed by senior ranks in the military.As the situation deteriorated overnight, prolonged gunfire was heard near Mugabe's private residence.On Wednesday, the TV state broadcaster played liberation struggle songs, while many citizens in Harare shopped at markets, drove to work or queued outside banks despite the turmoil.The US embassy warned its citizens in the country to ""shelter in place"" due to ""ongoing political uncertainty"".South Africa urged Zimbabwe to resist any ""unconstitutional changes"" of government, and said it was sending envoys to Harare on behalf of the SADC bloc of southern African nations to help resolve the impasse.President Mugabe and Grace made no public comment and their exact whereabouts was not known, while government and army spokesmen were not available to comment.""The government's silence on the military deployments seem to confirm that President Mugabe has lost control of the situation,"" Robert Besseling, of the London-based EXX Africa risk consultancy, said.Mugabe is the world's oldest head of state, but his poor health has fueled a bitter succession battle as potential replacements jockey for position.In speeches this year, Mugabe has often slurred his words, mumbled and paused for long periods.His lengthy rule has been marked by brutal repression of dissent, mass emigration, vote-rigging and economic collapse since land reforms in 2000.Grace's ambitionsSpeculation has been rife in Harare that Mugabe had sought to remove army chief Chiwenga, who is seen as an ally of ousted Mnangagwa.Mnangagwa, 75, was previously one of Mugabe's most loyal lieutenants, having worked alongside him for decades.Earlier this year Zimbabwe was gripped by a bizarre spat between Grace and Mnangagwa that included an alleged ice-cream poisoning incident that laid bare the pair's rivalry.Grace Mugabe  41 years younger than her husband  has become increasingly active in public life in what many say was a process to help her eventually take the top job.She was granted diplomatic immunity in South Africa in August after she allegedly assaulted a model at an expensive Johannesburg hotel where the couple's two sons were staying.As the economy collapsed since 2000, Zimbabwe was engulfed by hyperinflation and was forced to abandon its own currency in 2009 in favor of the US dollar.The country, which has an unemployment rate of over 90%, is due to hold elections next year with Mugabe pledging to stand for office again.

The most wanted terrorist leader was believed to be the emir of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Southeast Asia.The safe house in Basak Malutlut is a silent witness to the first exchange of gunfire between the military and local armed groups that sought to establish an Islamic caliphate reportedly in the name of international terrorist network ISIS. (READ: How a military raid triggered Marawi attacks)Hapilon escaped arrest on May 23. It would take nearly 5 months of war to finally get him on October 16. A government sniper's bullet hit him on the chest, killing him along with another terrorist leader, Omar Maute. (READ: Top Marawi siege leaders killed in clashes)The war that started in the safe house is not over. But with the leaders gone, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief General Eduardo Ao said it will be over soon.Most wantedRappler first visited the safe house in the abandoned village in June while clashes were at their height in another village, Banggolo.It was eerily quiet in the safe house, but the military warned of danger from possible stragglers. Residents have since been allowed to return, albeit only temporarily, if only to check their properties and their belongings.On May 23, troops were confident of the preparations they had made to get the veteran terrorist leader, who was in the most wanted list of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation at the time. He had a $5-million bounty on his head.Hapilon led a faction of the Abu Sayyaf Group that is notorious for its kidnap-for-ransom activities in Mindanao. He's long been the subject of a manhunt in his lairs in Basilan. (READ: What ISIS follower Isnilon Hapilon's transcripts reveal about his childhood)The military stepped up the manhunt when Hapilon moved to nearby Butig, Lanao del Sur, to join the highly-educated and well-connected Maute brothers, who like him pledged allegiance to ISIS. (READ: Terror in Mindanao: The Mautes of Marawi)It turned out the military underestimated enemy strength in the neighborhood of Basak Malutlut, a mistake that would trigger the war that has ravaged the city for 4 and a half months.""Nabigla tropa natin kasi noong gusto nila hulihin si Hapilon, kaunti lang tropa sa bahay na 'yun. Nung lapitan ang bahay... Sa paligid, may mga armado pala,"" said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.(The troops were surprised when they wanted to arrest Hapilon, because they initially thought there weren't too many armed men inside the house. When they moved closer to the house, it turned out there were other terrorists in the area.)What happened after Hapilon escaped surprised the generals.Black-clad Marawi residents carrying firearms and waving black ISIS flags rushed into the streets to attack strategic locations around the city. They occupied the Amai Pakpak Medical Center, harassed the military headquarters, released prisoners at the city jail, as well as set ablaze the Protestant-run Dansalan College and the Catholic Saint Mary's Cathedral.It meant the ISIS-wannabes had succeeded in recruiting a significant support base in Marawi City. The military didn't see that coming.Thus began one of the biggest, longest, and bloodiest operations of the Philippine military in recent history. (READ: I met a Maute soldier. He's a child.)The armed groups took hostages as they moved toward Banggolo, the city's commercial district, where they held out for months.A week after the war erupted, Brigadier General Nixon Fortes, who was then the commander of the Marawi-based 103rd Brigade, was relieved from his post.The military initially estimated there were only 70 fighters in Marawi City. There are now nearly 800 enemies killed, based on military reports.Propaganda videoBack in the safe house, the military recovered a video showing Hapilon and other leaders of the armed groups planning the attack. Among them was Malaysia's most wanted terrorist Mahmud Ahmad.""Puwede tayo mag-kuwan sa mga paaralan. Puwede tayo mag-hostage (We can target the schools. We can take hostages),"" Abdullah Maute is heard saying in the video. The military believes he was killed in the firefights.The video is supposedly propaganda material they meant to show ISIS if they succeeded in establishing a caliphate in Marawi City.""The grand plan of this Maute-ISIS group is actually, in time for the first day of Ramadan, they will seize the whole of Marawi and proclaim an Islamic caliphate just like what happened in Mosul when [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi occupied Mosul in June 2014,"" said Ao.But the military raid preempted a bigger terror attack, according to the AFP. ""It was aborted,"" said Ao.""They were not able to fully deploy all their forces, even additional forces from AKP (Ansarul Khilafah Philippines) and BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters). Supposedly more terrorists would join, but because of what happened, when we raided the safe house on May 23, where we got also the copies of the videos, it was all aborted,"" he added in a mix of English and Filipino.Urban warfare: From the jungles to the cityValiant Filipino soldiers used to fighting in the jungles find themselves in a terrain they are not accustomed to  urban warfare  against young radicals armed to the teeth.Well-trained enemy snipers occupied high-rise buildings and pinned down troops who took pains to advance toward enemy positions. Troops believe the enemies were trained by foreign jihadists who joined the war.Military armor can only do so much because the terrorists are armed with rocket-propelled grenades that can pierce through metal.The military relied on air strikes to soften enemy position before the ground assaults. But it caused tension with residents who feared the bombs would drop on their homes or loved ones still trapped in the battle zone.Residents pushed the government to negotiate with the terrorists as the military missed deadline after deadline. But the government rejected this.On October 16, the hunt for Hapilon ended, but the hunt for remaining terrorists continues in the battle zone.""It will be over sooner than you expect,"" said Ao.The war has already killed more than 1,000 people and laid waste to the heart of Marawi.
