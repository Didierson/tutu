(Philmaize), the urella organization of corn growers across the country, to create the rice-corn blend and make it part of the mainstream Filipino diet.\n\nThe initiative, according to Duterte, is part of the government’s efforts to ensure every Filipino of available, accessible and healthy food at all times, as well as protect and empower farmers.\n\n“The only way to help our farm workers is to bring them the market,” Duterte said during the launch.\n\nFor his part, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol said the rice and white corn coo is a healthier choice for the rice-eating Filipinos as corn contains higher amylose content which makes it harder to gelatinize and slower to digest.\n\n“Bigas-Mais is just one of our strategy to quash our dependence on imported rice every time a shortfall in supply surfaces,” he further said.\n\nBased on the agreement signed by DA, NFA and PhilMaize, DA must ensure the availability of quality corn seeds and provide the required interventions for production areas such as capacity-building, farm mechanization equipment, and postharvest facilities.\n\nNFA is tasked to distribute and market the rice-corn blend to their regular retail outlets, government institutions, non-government organizations, and other institutional buyers, and also to monitor the compliance o",

From the late 90s to this day, these schools have been the center of community life. This is why the Lumad are determined to defend these schools at all costs.\n\nThese schools are places where numeracy and literacy are taught not only to children but also to their parents. This is mindfully done to minimize possible gaps that new learning might entail. Lumad schools are also focused on the preservation and development of indigenous knowledge and culture. Here, students learn scientific farming. They are trained to cull knowledge from their family’s experience in planting, hunting, and raising animals and use these as baseline for further study toward more advanced farming methods.\n\nI have not met a Lumad child who does not want to farm when he or she grows up. The same child is almost always planning on becoming a teacher to his/her fellow Lumad. So I have understood that farming is something that they all want to do alongside the profession of teaching. I fully understand the attraction of the teaching profession to a child. My own teachers enthralled me.

Unfortunately, as we saw in recent weeks, SC justices were ready to surrender judicial independence to mere politicians because they simply hate the current chief justice.\n\nHere is that column updated and edited to comply with column space limitations recently imposed by the newspaper.\n\nI see the Supreme Court as just one more human institution subject to human failings and as such must always be accountable for its actions.\n\nThe law is what the Supreme Court says it is. Even when they are obviously wrong? Yes, even if the SC is wrong, it is right… because it is at the foundation of law and order in a civilized society.\n\nWhat about check and balance? The Constitution has been so designed to make sure no branch of government gets too powerful… the other branches are there to balance each other out.\n\nThe Supreme Court may seem like it always has the last word, but Congress can exercise its power over the purse on the Supreme Court. Or Congress can exercise its right to impeach the members of the Court.\n\nThe Executive branch can control budget releases. The Executive branch also controls the police and the armed forces and the Court, a toothless tiger, needs these resources to implement its decisions.\n\nThe real power of the Supreme Court over the two other branches is its moral ascendancy… it is supposed to be above the normal political fray… a collegial body of wise men (and women) with no other interest other than to see justice is delivered.\n\nThe Court’s prestige fell apart when martial law was declared in September 1972.

A common reaction to the announcement was: why only 90? It must be just the first batch, with the 90 mostly members of the PNP officer corps.\n\nThe President surely believes that there are more than 90 “gangsters” in the police service. He had once described the PNP as “rotten to the core.” Besides corruption, cops have been implicated in criminal activities including kidnapping, carjacking and drug trafficking. The President’s so-called narco list includes police officers including generals. In his bloody war against illegal drugs, vigilantes executing civilians are widely suspected to be the so-called “ninja cops” who are permanently silencing potential witnesses against them. Purging the PNP of such scalawags is overdue.\n\nThe President should not limit his anti-corruption purge to the PNP. It can be extended to other agencies notorious for corruption such as the Bureau of Customs. The Department of the Interior and Local Government also has disciplinary powers over barangay offices. In local governments, the President can prod his political allies to conduct similar purges. A thorough housecleaning is always welcome as the nation rings in a new year.",

It appears that \"covfefe\" was meant to be \"coverage\" and was accidentally sent out to the netiverse before the thought was even completed, but of course, it now means whatever you want it to mean, like a confusing abstract painting.\n\nMonths later, a similar gaffe happened to the official account of our own Presidential Communications team, almost as if the Philippines didn't want to be outdone by Trump's high-jinks.\n\nThis turned out to be arguably the mildest mistake the team has made in 2017.

Most books will tell you that it’s having a huge capital, finding the right location, targeting the right market, or creating attractive advertisements.\n\nYes, these are essential factors to consider but for a business to thrive and stay for the long haul, it must have the most important secret ingredient of all – purpose.\n\nThis is what our speakers, Jourdan Sebastian, CEO of Taclob, and Raf Dionisio, Co-founder of The Circle Hostel, shared with us during the #WhatsNext workshop held last November 11.\n\nJourdan and Raf are both owners of successful businesses with a purpose. (READ: #WhatsNext: How ‘telling good stories’ can lead to business success)\n\nFor the participants, this piece of advice helped them identify the kind of business they would happily wake up on Mondays for.\n\nOne of them is Kristina Aiza Tan. She originally wanted to expand her family’s private resort business by building some of her own. But after hearing from Jourdan, she realized that what she wants to do instead is to sell eco-friendly utensils, plates, and other disposables that are usually packed for trips to a resort.\n\n“At our resorts, we’ve always encouraged our visitors to bring their own plates and utensils to minimize waste,” said Kristina. “Now, I know that what I really want to do is to help protect the environment.”\n\nWhile for some, this nugget of wisdom validated the kind of business they’re already in.\n\nPaolo Tomacruz and Job Corpuz (and Danaraye Torres) are a couple of college students who started a t-shirt business called ‘Magiting’. It aims to promote Baybayin, a form of Filipino writing that’s now being forgotten.\n\n“We take so much pride in other things like Manny Pacquiao. Why not take pride in something we can also be proud of like our old way of writing,” said Job.\n\nWhat started as a school project is now a profitable business t",

The longer the rainfall, the more vulnerable the red areas become. Those in red areas are mountains with steep slopes, fractures, and structurally weak rock formations with a history of landslides.\n\nOn the other hand, green areas are moderately susceptible to landslides.

During the last couple of weeks, we have been engrossed on the ill side effects of the dengue vaccine Dengvaxia. The hysterical debate on the controversial vaccine made it appear like there was no other peril to public health. In fact, HIV/AIDS is a far graver problem because unlike dengue, it is contagious, its mode of transmission associated with the response to a basic human need--or frailty.\n\nRecords of the Department of Health showed that there have been a total of 47,921 HIV/AIDS cases in the country since 1984 up to the third quarter of this year, 936 of them occurring or discovered withIn the month of September, 2017 alone. The number is expected to rise when the figures for this year’s last quarter are tallied.\n\nAnd here’s the frightening thing for members of the male sex: a staggering 94 percent of those afflicted with the deadly disease are men. Not surprisingly, most of them have had male sexual partners.\n\nThe DOH records show that more than one-half (24,578) of the cases come from the 35-34 years bracket. What bothers the agency is that the next age group with the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS infection was between 15 to 24 years. They’re starting young.\n\nCentral Visayas currently has 4,402 cases, according to DOH records, averaging two to three new cases per day lately with Cebu on top of the list. In Cebu City, male-to-male sex appears to be more rampant than in such urban centers as the cities of Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan and Davao, according to the same DOH records.\n\nAnd here’s the most alarming part of all: of the 47,921 cases, only 23,307 are enrolled in the Antiretroviral Treatment Program of the DOH, much lower th",

The six were selected from some 500 submissions received by HOOQ over a two-month period from all over South East Asia.\n\nThe six entries that have been earmarked for pilots span a range of genres.\n\nIndia’s winning entry, Bhak, is a colourful dramedy that follows the adventures of two ambitious young filmmakers in the Bollywood film industry.  Written by Arjun Chatterjee and Shreyom Ghosh from Big3 Media, it explores themes of passion, betrayal and love.\n\nSuay, a Thai crime thriller by Marcelo von Schwartz, follows the story of ladyboy go-go dancer Lola, who receives a cut-off ear belonging to her best friend and mentor, Carly.  She is then forced to draw upon her past identity as a tough male private detective and descend into the underbelly of Bangkok.\n\nSupernatural drama Haunt Me, by Oman Dhas and Goh Ming Siu from Third Floor Pictures, follows the story of Kwong, a widower, who after his father’s death, moves into his family ancestral home and discovers his family’s secret sacred destiny; guiding lost souls to the other side.\n\nThe other Singaporean entry, How To Be A Good Girl, comes from Abundant Productions and follows former socialite turned ex-convict, Frances Lee, who is looking to reclaim her life after time behind bars.\n\nThe Indonesian winning entries reflect two ends of the genre sprectrum.

The forum was organized by students of the Principles of Development Communication class under professor and former  reporter, Anne Ednalyn Dela Cruz.\n\nDela Cruz urged her students and those who came to listen to the forum to act against abuses on women, especially those from the marginalized sectors. “We do not keep this just as a note, we should bring and share it wherever it is needed,” she said.\n\nSpeakers in the forum were: Miriam Grafil of the Center for Women’s Resources (CWR) and Gabriela Women’s Partylist (GWP) Rep. Emmi De Jesus. Actress and model Kat Alano, a VAW survivor, also spoke about her experience and why women should fight back.

Many women are barred from getting jobs, as companies disqualify applicants who are married, pregnant or beyond a certain age limit.\n\nPoor women need to work for a living, and amid the rising unemployment, many are pushed to prostitution.

Indications show that he is unleashing the dirty tactics of his notorious “war on drugs” – a class war on the poor which has killed more than 10,000 suspected drug addicts and pushers – against the Left, the most vocal critic of his drug war and other policies.\n\nIt is in this context that academic and historian Lisandro “Leloy” E. Claudio discussed what he called “Responsible Anti-Communism” in his recent column. By “Communist,” he is rightly referring to the underground Communist Party of the Philippines which leads the National Democratic Front of the Philippines and the New People’s Army. In his column, he echoes Duterte and revives McCarthyist tactics in insisting that the label “Communist” should also refer to legal organizations being tagged as the CPP’s “legal fronts.”\n\nThe past few days saw tarpaulin banners calling the CPP, NPA and NDF “terrorist” proliferating along major thoroughfares in Metro Manila. This is part of a concerted effort to try to condition the public for more attacks against the said groups, as well as legal activist organizations. On social media, especially among the educated middle classes, Claudio’s most recent column functions as the counterpart of those tarpaulin banners.\n\nFor Claudio, “responsible anti-Communism” means being firmly against Communists but standing up for their human rights against the State’s attacks. It means harshly criticizing Communists while taking a stand against their “extermination” and the violation of their rights by the government.\n\nHe states only one reason f",

And he’s very nice,” said 29-year-old Rina Aparicio, among the customers at the fastfood outlet. “I asked for a selfie and he said yes right away.”\n\nOutside the store, hundreds of people screamed and shouted as Trudeau got into his car, waving what appeared to be hastily written placards saying “Welcome to the Philippines!”\n\nTrudeau visited the first Jollibee store in Winnipeg, Canada in January, a country with hundreds of thousands of Filipino immigrants.\n\nJollibee, a $5 billion company that has been dubbed the McDonald’s of the Philippines, is looking to go global with primary targets including China and the United States.\n\nThe company, which also serves burgers and sweet spaghetti, is opening another outlet in Winnipeg this month and plans are to increase that to 30 in five to 10 years, said Jos",

Alas, we were disheartened and disappointed when Congress extended Martial Law for another year, or until December 31, 2018.\n\n​For more than six (6) months, our people have practically lost everything. Yes, we do not discount the fact that the Maute-ISIS Group started it all. We are also thankful to the government for its efforts to crush the terrorist groups and keep the people safe. Even so, the implementation of Martial Law continues to cause hardship to our people.\n\nThe Martial Law under the 1987 Constitution supposedly has safeguards to prevent abuse by the military. Despite these safeguards, there are countless stories of missing persons and warrantless searches of Muslim homes in and out of Marawi City. We ask why homes in military-controlled areas were notoriously looted. We ask, if only the military had access to the Hall of Justice, then how come the offices and courtrooms were ransacked and destroyed. Stored evidence consisting of guns and drugs went missing. We ask why there has been no investigation on this matter to date. If the Hall of Justice was not spared from injustice and abuse, several other abuses – documented or not — have also been perpetrated to ordinary citizens. And so, to give us another year of Martial Law is intolerable for all of us.\n\nTo be sure, we are equally concerned with security threats in the region. We also want the government to suppress and prevent rebellion and lawless violence. But then, can it not be done through the Calling Out Power as provided for in the 1987 Constitution?\n\nArticle VII, Section 18 of the 1987 Constitution allows the President to call out the Armed Forces to suppress or prevent lawless violence and rebellion. This power is similar to ordinary police action and is not subject to the approval of Congress. The f",

The bulk of the nonfilers, however, ran for councilor, with six of these actually winning in the polls. The seventh winner-nonfiler – a mayor — died even before he could take his oath of office. The rest of the nonfilers lost in the elections.\n\nMore than half of the SOCE nonfilers had declared themselves as Independent on their certificates of candidacy while about 10 percent (402) were affiliated with the Liberal Party.\n\nFour other parties with more than 100 nonfilers among their respective candidates were the United Nationalist Alliance (361 or nine percent of the total nonfilers), Nationalist People’s Coalition (216 or five percent), Partido Bagong Maharlika (158 or four percent), and Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (127 or three percent).\n\nThe Comelec En Banc received the list of 2016 SOCE nonfilers from the CFO last July 11. With the list having been noted by the Comelec En Banc, the CFO can now send notices to the nonfilers for them to pay the applicable administrative fine.\n\nCFO ",

The signed law provides adjustments in personal income taxes, while increasing the excise tax rates of fuel, automobile, coal, tobacco, and sugar sweetened beverages. It also aims to broaden the tax base by removing some exemptions in the value-added tax system.\n\nThe second part of the bill, which will come in the first quarter of next year, covers the proposed tax amnesty program, adjustments in the Motor Vehicle Users Charge, and amendments in the Bank Secrecy Law.\n\nMeanwhile, the DBCC, after its meeting yesterday, adjusted the government’s medium term fiscal program due to the lower than ",

This administration brooks no delay in building the projects that the people need and the public deserves,” he said.\n\nThis, he said, is proven by the fast implementation of the Clark International Airport expansion project, which is among the first big-ticket infrastructure projects to be built using the hydrid PPP formula. Under the scheme, the government starts the initial phase of the project’s construction and later bids out the project to the private sector.\n\n“This shovel-ready project was approved in the first 18 months of the Duterte administration. In fact, the formal approval came only six months ago,” Dominguez said.\n\nAccording to Dominguez, the proposed new terminal is designed to handle up to eight million passengers per year. The new terminal is expected to accommodate the influx of passengers brought about by the rapid development of industries in the Clark zone and surrounding areas.\n\nHe said the airport would complement the congested Ninoy Aquino International Airport and effectively function as the second airport serving Central and Northern Luzon.",

One solution that we’ve been writing about for years is to institute a merit/demerit system like what they have in Europe or in the US.\n\nWell, apparently those columns have not been in vain because yesterday I saw over ANC a report that said that the Land Transportation Office (LTO) will begin implementing a point demerit system in 2018 following incidents of road rage over the past week. LTO’s Francis Almora, director for law enforcement service, said drivers involved in incidents like road rage will receive a 10-point demerit, which would result in a shorter license validity or even suspension.\n\nIn my book, the LTO should not just implement a point system to road rage violators but especially to people who park illegally in our streets.

It takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the fresh law, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAccording to the DOF, the first tax reform package was “designated to shift the tax burden from the lower 99 percent of the community to the wealthiest 1 percent.”\n\nIt would also end the country’s complex tax system that has become vulnerable to evasion and leakages by transforming it into a “simple, just and efficient” structure, the DOF added.\n\nBut before this major victory of the Duterte government, the bill, according to the president himself, had met “rough sailing” before it reached his desk. Despite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s tax reform program had encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nSome sectors also warned that imposing higher excise taxes on cars, coal, fuel, mining, among others, could hurt the robust growth of certain industries.\n\nIn that regard, is the TRAIN law really a boon or a bane for both rich and poor Filipinos?\n\nIn an opinion piece published on Busine",

Ronaldo Zamora and his son, former vice mayor Francis Zamora, reportedly used public funds to entice poor residents to sign the petition for the holding of recall elections to oust Mayor Guia Gomez, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito said yesterday.\n\nEjercito said his 75-year-old mother was “being bullied by the Zamoras using their power, money and influence.”\n\n“But we will stand by our principles and fight for what is right. Even money and power from a mining empire will not stop us,” the senator said.\n\nHe said the Zamoras extended government health and cash-for-work assistance to poor residents, which enabled them to obtain over 30,000 signatures for the petition.\n\n“I hope the Comelec (Commission on Elections) takes this into consideration. Public funds, medical assistance, financial assistance, scholarships were used in gathering these signatures. This is too much,” he said.\n\nEjercito lamented that the city’s political culture has changed from unity to division “because of the ambition and obsession of the Zamoras.”\n\nHe said San Juan City has been undergoing tremendous development in the past year as a result of his mother’s sound financial management.\n\n“The city now is capable of undertaking projects and programs that were just a dream before. The residents and businessmen are satisfied with the progress and development,” he said.\n\n“Just one question, do you think the Zamoras run for public offices to serve the people of San Juan? On the contrary, Zamoras run not to serve the people but to protect their business interests especially in mining,” he added.\n\nThe recall election process is aimed at ending the 48-year rule of the Estradas in San Juan and not to bully Gomez, the younger Zamora said yesterday.\n\n“How can I bully her when they are in power and I’m a private citizen already as I lost in the last election?

If you steal billions from taxpayers, you become a member of Congress, or a mayor – as long as you hire top lawyers and know how to share the loot. Only those who don’t share go to hell.\n\nThese were common comments after a 21-year-old store clerk was caught by a security guard and sent to jail for pilfering a can of corned beef from a branch of one of the nation’s top supermarket chains.\n\nFor stealing from his employer, the store clerk faces a criminal case for qualified theft, which carries a heavier penalty than ordinary theft. Qualified theft is a bailable offense, and those who offered to pay for the corned beef “a hundred times over” should have just shouldered his bail of P2,000 ASAP.\n\nInstead the clerk spent several days in a Manila jail before his mother managed to raise the cash and bail him out.\n\nThe public pity is valid; the world’s Jean Valjeans, not his pursuer Inspector Javert, get the sympathy. And the sentiments amplified at the start of this article are even more valid. Why did the store clerk land in jail, while Imelda Marcos is in Congress? Why are the crooks who inflicted on us the disaster that is the Metro Rail Transit 3 enjoying a merry Christmas, while the store clerk, whose name in the age of Google will always be associated with stealing from his employer, is facing an uncertain future?\n\nQualified theft is a felony, and it doesn’t exempt the poor or the hungry. There are many poor and hungry people who don’t resort to stealing.\n\nThat supermarket chain is too big to ignore wage rates set by law, so the clerk couldn’t have been as penniless as he painted himself to be, or so famished he would hide a can of corned beef in his store apron to eat… when and where? In the employees’ toilet? He would have had to open the can in front of coworkers in the employees’ canteen, and then cook the corned beef unless he’s willing to risk botulism.\n\nStill, his story inevitably generat",

Whether or not the extension sought by President Duterte and approved overwhelmingly by Congress is supported by the public, the SC will have to rule on the constitutionality of a move that allows martial law to be in place way beyond the 60-day period of the original imposition stipulated in the Constitution.\n\nIn the meantime, the enforcers of martial law are busy allaying fears that the one-year extension would invite human rights abuses. Similar fears were raised when President Duterte declared martial law all over Mindanao for the first time in May as Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists inspired by the Islamic State laid siege to Marawi. The same fears were raised when the original 60-day period lapsed and Congress agreed to extend martial law until the end of this year.\n\nThat the government managed to allay the fears was due in large part to the way the Armed Forces of the Philippines conducted the war in Marawi. The AFP convinced a jittery nation that it is not dictator Ferdinand Marcos’ military, and that it will stand in the way of attempts to use military rule for purposes other than defense against enemies of the state. School children wrote letters of support to soldiers in the frontlines. Those returning from the battlefield received a heroes’ welcome as the Marawi terrorists and their top supporters were arrested or killed.\n\nSeveral groups are reportedly gathering witnesses and evidence to refute the stories of heroism and prove that human rights abuses were in fact committed by the AFP during the siege.

Per se, collecting is a great hobby and unless that hobby does not contradict the norms of society, there’s nothing wrong with it.  It becomes contradictory when it negatively affects the collector’s life.\n\nFor starters, these shoes are expensive and with the ease of online purchases, huge credit card debts are accumulated that result in financial problems.

This was bared by Councilor Jerry Guardo, Chairman of the Committee of Youth and Sports and head of the tournament’s organizing committee at a press gathering at Yayoy’s Grill yesterday.\n\nLeading the teams is PBA D-League team Marinerong Pilipino which will be fielding its new recruits in Alvin Pasaol, Vince Tolentino, and Abu Tratter. They will face the challenge of local teams led by UV-SRG/ARQ Builders, UC/M. Lhuillier, Cebu Landmasters and University of San Jose Recoletos.\n\nGuardo said the re-launch of the tournament was in reply to the call to revive the amateur basketball scene that has been silent for a long time now. “This gives us the opportunity to revive the local basketball league in Cebu City,” Guardo said. He added that this has the full support of the Cebu City Sports Commission and the City Council, and will be the first of a series of tournaments for 2018. “This is just the launch and everything will follow suit,” he added.\n\nJoining Guardo at the press conference were Cebu City Sports Commission Chairman Ed Hayco and Deputy Mayor for Sports Jun Gabuya.\n\nAll teams are expected to strengthen their sides as the tournament is open and will also feature imports. Marinerong Pilipino is considered as the pre-tourney favorite as it prepares for the upcoming PBA D-League games. Leading the team is head coach Koy Banal. However, the local teams will be up to the challenge to defend their turf. (FREEMAN)",

Thomas was scheduled to work out at the Cavs' training facility in Independence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thomas said how his body responds from the stress of 5-on-5 scrimmages will determine how soon he'll be able to make his debut with Cleveland. He's been sidelined since aggravating a hip injury in the playoffs last season with the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Cavs have said since October that they believed Thomas would be able to play in NBA games by Jan. 1. The 28-year-old was acquired during a hectic offseason in a trade for All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving. The Celtics sent Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and a draft pick to Cleveland in the blockbuster deal.\n\nCleveland is eager to add him to the lineup, and LeBron James has sensed that Thomas is ready.\n\n\"Yeah, his attitude is getting worse and worse because he's getting closer and closer,\" James said following the team's morning shootaround before hosting the Chicago Bulls. \"When you get closer and closer to something you love and you want, your attitude actually gets worse.\"\n\nThomas, who averaged 28.9 points last season as one of the NBA's top playmakers, said he wants to be \"special\" when he returns to the floor and not \"just another body.\"\n\nAfter a slow start, the Cavaliers have won 18 of 20 and 11 straight at home. They'll visit the Golden State Warriors on Christmas and play at Sacramento and Utah next week before returning to Cleveland to face Portland on Jan. 2.\n\nThe next day, they'll play in Boston for their second matchup with Irving. This time, they might have Thomas on the floor.\n\n\"We're all excited for when he's able to come back to the team, but he's been around the team all year,\" James said.",

The latter want small neighbors to stay weak in the face of their militarization of the South China Sea. There should be no hindrance to their concreting of reefs into artificial island-fortresses. Beijing resented Manila’s purchase in 2014 of a squadron of 12 trainer supersonic fighters.\n\nManila’s frigate acquisition would bolster Philippine maritime security. The tiff between defense decision makers, including the relief of the Navy flag officer in command, mars the naval beef-up. Reportedly the differences were over the combat control system, of which weaponry is the core of the anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine capability. The choice of such CMS is strategic. So should be the thinking and action of the security brass.\n\nCompassion prevailed. Despite his anger with local communist rebels for ambushing soldiers on humanitarian mission, President Rody Duterte unilaterally declared Christmas truce with them. Their sneak attack on troops rescuing landslide victims in Northern Samar mimicked their massacre years ago of soldiers rushing food to flooded Bulacan villagers. Similar assaults on unarmed soldiers marketing for food and on security guards of agribusinesses earlier prompted Duterte to halt peace talks. He also began the process of classifying them as terrorists, to foil their financiers. Riskily that could antagonize mere political dissenters and so fuel the rebel propaganda. With the 1992 repeal of the Anti-Subversion Law, it is no longer a crime to espouse communism, only to take up arms against the state. Perhaps the Christmas ceasefire would give political leaders time to reflect on that.\n\nBackchannels reportedly are still open between government and rebel negotiators. That can only be with Duterte’s consent. Admitting to be a one-time sympathizer, he entertains the possibility of ending the 49-y",

Now, it’s time to move on.”\n\nTratter, who turns 25 on Jan. 9, was picked on the fourth round by Marinerong Pilipino in the recent PBA D-League draft. Before leaving to spend the holidays with family in Milpitas, California, the other day, he was with Marinero coach Koy Banal for four practices. Some of his Marinero teammates are former UAAP adversaries Vince Tolentino and Gboy Babilonia of Ateneo and Alvin Pasaol of UE. Tratter said he’ll be back on Jan. 7 to resume workouts with Marinero. He’ll be lined up by La Salle to play in the PCCL National Collegiate Championships on Feb. 2-11.\n\nBefore playing for La Salle, Tratter was with the St. Francis High School basketball and track varsities in Mountain View, California then suited up a year at DeAnza College in Cupertino, also in California. The year at DeAnza was counted against his five years of UAAP eligibility so he played only four seasons at La Salle.\n\n“I’ve got a year and a half left to earn my degree in psychology,” said Tratter. “That’s 70 units.

    "body": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines turned 82 yesterday as it prepared for the one-year extension of martial law in the entire Mindanao. It is to the AFP’s credit that opposition to the extension, overwhelmingly ratified by the pro-administration super majority in Congress, has been generally subdued. It is also to the credit of this AFP that people perceive martial law in the Duterte administration to be different from military rule during Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship.\n\nPublic trust, however, must be nurtured. The perception that the AFP can be trusted with immense martial law powers can vanish overnight. In recent weeks, complaints have emerged, accusing the AFP of human rights violations in fighting the Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists who laid siege to Marawi for five months. So far, however, the AFP is generally seen to have accomplished its mission in Marawi. The AFP lost scores of its members in driving out the terrorists and killing their top commanders. The military victory allowed residents to return to their homes for the difficult task of rebuilding a ruined city.\n\nThe one-year extension will still be challenged before the courts. But its implementation starts on the first day of the new year, and the AFP must show that it can sustain its conduct in Marawi in the continued fight against Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Communist rebels have been added to the targets of martial law, which could alter perceptions of the way the battle is carried out.\n\nAfter President Duterte declared Marawi “liberated” from the IS-Maute threat, soldiers returning from the battle received a hero’s welcome. This was a big cause for celebration yesterday at the 82nd anniversary of the Armed Forces. As the AFP looks forward to another year, its members must not lose public trust. Remembering their anniversary theme would be useful: “protecting the people, securing the state.”",

Guided boat tours take visitors down a portion of the waterway, where karsts, natural rock formations created by dissolving limestone loom in every direction,” the magazine said.\n\nLast July, Boracay and Palawan were voted by readers of the international Travel+Leisure magazine as the third and first best island in the world, respectively.",

It was clear that given the provisions on an amendment by the 1987 Constitution it cannot be amended constitutionally. Chairman Victor Ortega, a good friend, said to me something unforgettable. It made me understand why all efforts at reforming the Constitution were futile.\n\n“This Constitution is so flawed that even its provision for amendments has to be amended,” he said in reply to those who opposed it. If this is the only thing we do in this Congress, we would have done the best thing we could ever do for this country. Think about it. Think of how many times constitutional reforms have been attempted since President Cory. It could not be amended during President Ramos’ time, in President Erap’s time or in President Arroyo’s time. We should ask why and how this has been made impossible while other countries are able to amend their constitutions when it is called for? That should give the clue that something else besides local partisan politics is frustrating it.\n\nThat goes for the present debate on whether we should have a con-con or a con-ass. It is a waste of time. The same lame excuses will be pulled out of the hat – that the incumbent president just wants to extend his or her term,\n\nThe people’s initiative that was supposed to have been enshrined by people power revolution in the 1987 Constitution has proven to be impossible after all. I have gone through People’s initiatives –The first during Ramos’ time but the Supreme Court had the final say, “There was no enabling law.” I was able to get copies of the hearings in Congress that proved there was an enabling law. This was almost at the end Cory Aquino’s term and it was marked as urgent.\n\nThere was an enabling law. One or two of the justices knew it but they were overwhelmed. One conveniently left the country when it was time to vote.\n\nAll one needs to do is dig it up in the Congressional archives (I have a co",

The schedule is about the best players, not all the best teams.\n\nAnd with Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Kristaps Porzingis starting the day, and Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Karl-Anthony Towns finishing it, this year’s showcase is as much about the guys who got next on the marquee as the ones on top already.\n\n“They’re doing it for talent. You have the talent and the marketable players, so I understand why they’re picking those teams,” said Sacramento veteran Vince Carter.\n\nChristmas was once a kickoff of sorts for the NBA, the first time a national audience paid attention to basketball with the football season winding down. ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy, who will work the Cavs-Warriors game, was among those who had said the NBA should consider starting its season at Christmas to get out from under the NFL’s shadow.\n\nNow it’s a celebration of the success the league is already enjoying. Combined viewership on ESPN and TNT is up 21 percent this season, with games averaging 1.9 million viewers, even before what figures to be the biggest numbers of the season.\n\nESPN said its audience is the second-highest it’s ever had at this point behind 2010-11, James’ first season in Miami, and Van Gundy said he’s even a little surprised.\n\n“I don’t know what it speaks to, but we do have a bunch of really good, young players,” Van Gundy said. “We have a dynasty in the making in Golden State, we have a team trying to challenge them in their own conference, or a couple teams in San Antonio and Houston, and LeBron is still rolling.”\n\nAll of them but the Spurs are in action Monday (Tuesday Manil",

So was the message conveyed by Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma as Christians get ready to commemmorate the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem over 2,000 years ago. He particularly mentioned about the five-month-long armed conflict in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur that left 974 Maute members, 165 soldiers and policemen, and 47 civilians dead as well as the passing of Cebu Archbishop Emeritus Ricardo Cardinal Vidal. Christmas, he said, is a reminder about Jesus who stripped Himself of His glory to share in the sufferings of the world, and to free humanity from the slavery of sin. “No matter what happens, God is with us. He is Emmanuel (God with us). Let us never lose hope,” he said in his Christmas 2017 message. Palma called on the faithful to cling to God, and to make room for Jesus in their hearts. “I would like you to reflect how the child Jesus was born in a crib surrounded by animals. That happened because no one received Mary and Joseph in their homes,” the 67-year-old prelate said. “He shouldn’t have been born there because He is God. And so we tell him ‘Lord, if there are people who did not accept you, I invite you to live in my heart. I welcome you in our family. We welcome you in our community,’” he added. With God, he said everything is fine no matter how gloom the circumstance may be. “When He is with us, there is renewal; a change for the better. In effect, there is love, mercy, and forgiveness,” Palma said. Journeying with the Lord, he said, should lead one to helping others so as to extend God’s mercy and love. “His coming brought hope and joy to people. I hope, in our own little ways, we can be instruments of hope and joy to other people. Just as Jesus was a gift to us from God the Father, may we also become a gift to other people,” he said. “In that way, we can make our community, archdiocese, and country a better place to live in. Because God is with us, we have every reason to hope for a better tomorrow,” he added.",

Roque said that if an application for the coveted slot would not be approved within seven days after filing, it would then be considered approved.\n\nHowever, Rio said the government would name the prospective third player by the end of the deadline set by the President. The third player would need to have a war chest of at least $2.7 billion to be able to compete with existing players, he said.\n\nRio did not identify the four companies, opting to let them make the announcements themselves. Nevertheless, he said these companies were from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nWhile he did not officially identify the interested parties, Rio cited familiar names such as Australia’s Telstra Corp. and Japan’s NTT Communications Corp.\n\nTo recall, Telstra earlier negotiated with San Miguel Corp. for partnership for a telecommunication venture last year, but later stopped from pursuing this project. NTT Communications, on the other hand, is already in partnership with telco giant PLDT Inc.\n\n Rio said he was not sure how NTT’s possible next move would affect its existing arrangement with PLDT.\n\nNothing is definite or official, Rio said. “They just indicated through some publications that [they are] interested.”\n\nSince the Philippine Constitution limits foreign companies from having full ownership of telcos in the country, the third player would have",

The World Bank reports that the average cost of sending money is around 7.21%.\n\nWorldRemit research revealed that switching to lower cost channels could mean thousands of Filipinos could receive an extra Christmas present this year.  The savings were highest when sending from Canada to the Philippines – enough to buy a T-shirt back home.\n\nWith many Filipinos in Canada earning around USD 6-10 an hour, these high costs mean the diaspora are having to work up to an hour more than necessary to cover the elevated costs of sending with traditional channels.\n\n“It’s important to consider that the cost of sending money goes far beyond the transactional cost. Traditional methods mean travelling to an agent to pay in money, taking time off work to do so knowing your family and friends receiving the money will have to do the same.\n\nBy sending money from one mobile to another instantly, we can  save people not just money, but also time.”\n\nConsidering that it costs almost USD 3 (PHP150) to get into Makati from the suburbs of Manila and can take a least an hour there and back, picking up cash can also bring high costs for the recipient.\n\nWorldRemit data suggests that most of their customers send between three and four transactions a month to the Philippines so the savings across the month of December could be even greater. The savings on travel and time alone could be enough to buy a Christmas ham.\n\n“We see that being able to send money more frequently without paying high costs and wasting time brings families and friends closer together even when living hundreds of miles apart.

In a pile, there are plastics, metals, glass, furniture and food scraps.\n\nAnother thing that similar in these areas is that residents from those areas are disgusted. They are also left dumbfounded: who are throwing these growing piles of trash?\n\nFor a growing city which still struggles to manage solid wastes, residents and local officials are getting more concerned about illegal dumping. This is happening in areas where garbage trucks from the city’s designated garbage hauler, R.C.

Violators of the law could potentially face fine penalties of P300 to P1,000 or one-to-15 days of rendering community service, depending on a local court’s discretion.\n\nBut not even a while tarpaulin, with a text that says offenders will be fined P500 plus community service, in J.

We still have to watch out for the stabbings, muggings and robberies which I think are more important,” Pagcaliwangan told The Filipino Connection.\n\nMost of the dumpers, he alleges, were outsiders and residents of neighboring barangays.

It was the Boomers’ first game in the Australian state in 20 years.\n\nBut the Boomers had to work their way in bruising past a tough-playing Japanese side that may give hints on how Gilas of the Philippines will match up with the Australians on Feb. 22, 2018.\n\nThe lead ballooned to its biggest 49-33 of an alley-hoop until Japan brought it down to seven, 55-48.\n\nJapanese star guard Yuki Togashi, at 5’6,” kept the pace of the game to Japan’s liking in the first. But as long as he was sent out at the 8:50 mark in the second, guards off the bench struggled in dictating the offense.\n\nThe Mitch Creek alley-hoop pass to fellow Adelaide 36er Matt Hodgson sealed the deal, 79-58.\n\nThe Boomers squad here, all from the local National Basketball League (NBL), showed why they will be the toughest test for the Philippines Gilas team. The current five did not even have an NBA player in its roster.\n\n“We need those sorts of games for this team to build,” Lemanis said who’s discontented with 16 turnovers and some stumbling moments due to the physicality of the Japanese. “Yet if you held a team to 58 pts. You have a chance to beat them.”\n\nBut the Japanese third-quarter run that led to a 48-55 deficit baffled the Boomers, yet Lemanis credits the team’s defense for surviving the Akatsuki onslaught. Japan can’t score in the last three minutes of the game.\n\nOn looking forward to the game against the Philippines, Lemanis calls the style of Filipino play as “free flowing” and with “much freedom.”\n\nThe Philippines is a “good athletic group,” Lemanis said. “They  move the ball, let them fly, play with good energy and fun around",

Risks, he said, are not confined to starting businesses.

He explained the need to seek people who offer different perspectives and are willing to challenge the status quo. “If you only have one perspective and you only see things the way you want to see them, you are not going to see the possibilities for all the doors,” Lipp said.\n\nBut it should go beyond hiring the most competitive people in the industry, Lipp explained.

The urgency with which they run tells us that something is amiss – and the next scene tells us it has to do with the royal marriage. Between Queen Elizabeth (Claire Foy) and Prince Philip (Matt Smith), there is a quiet, brewing intensity so powerful you might find yourself gasping for air before you even realized you’d stopped breathing.\n\nAs far as series openers go, this one packs a one-two punch. In just a few minutes of screen time, it quickly reminds viewers of (or introduces them to) what is perhaps The Crown’s greatest strength: the commanding presence and chemistry of its two leads. In the same breath, it defines the point at which we now find our main characters: no longer in the first blush of marital bliss, one of them settling deeper into her royal duty, the other continuing to cling to his former freedoms.\n\nThe compelling opening is rightly reassuring, if only because The Crown’s stunning first season is undeniably a tough act to follow.\n\nAfter all, as the show continues without the fascinating character that is Winston Churchill (played perfectly in season 1 by John Lithgow), the noble father figure that is King George VI (Jared Harris), or the swoon-inducing early marriage of a young Elizabeth and Philip, one might say that The Crown comes into its new season rather crippled.\n\nYet in the British spirit of “Keep calm and carry on,” it moves along on its historical timeline unruffled. The stories continue to unfold with the same evocative gravitas and sumptuous production value as it always has.\n\nThe second season’s story starts in February 1957, when Prince Philip returns from his 5-month royal tour around the world. It then doubles back to a few months earlier, when Queen Elizabeth faces the 1956 Suez Crisis which her new prime minister, Anthony Eden (Jeremy Nor",

Yet, just as has been the case for the past century, wherever there were opportunities for young men to literally fight their way up the ladder in life, they did so. With the spotlight coming off Pacquiao, other fighters stepped in to make their names.\n\nJerwin Ancajas, the IBF junior bantamweight titleholder, was the fighter who generated the most excitement in 2017, making 3 defenses of the belt in 3 different countries, scoring knockouts against each challenger. There were two other Filipino fighters who added world titles, with Donnie Nietes capturing the vacant IBF flyweight belt with a win over Komgrich Nantapech, joining Pacquiao and Nonito Donaire Jr as the only boxers from the Philippines to win championships in at least 3 divisions, and Milan Melindo, the hard-luck warrior from Cagayan de Oro City who made good on his mandatory shot, stopping Akira Yaegashi in the first round to win the IBF junior flyweight belt.\n\nThe Philippines also lost title belts, with Pacquiao dropping a shock decision to Jeff Horn in Australia for the WBO welterweight crown, and Marlon Tapales being stripped of the WBO bantamweight belt after he missed the 118-pound weight limit before stopping Shohei Omori in April. The 25-year-old Tapales did not fight again the rest of the year after being out of the ring for 9 months before that.\n\nWas 2017 a “Passing of the Torch” year? It’s hard to say, though the recent success of Ancajas has given some hope that fans may be ready to coalesce around a new fighter.

Gameplan host Mara Lopez and working mom Trixie Monteron try out a suspension training class for the first time to help us gain insights on how this type of exercise works.\n\n“Suspension training is a form of training where you use suspension trainers to put yourself out of balance on purpose. It improves the strength of the core. That’s very important in sports, in recreational activities, or just in everyday living,” shared Gabriel Soriano, a strength and conditioning coach at the 360 Fitness Club.\n\nAccording to Gabriel, beginners usually find this exercise intimidating because of the equipment used for the workout and the lack of understanding that this type of exercise can be modified based on a person’s fitness level.\n\n“It’s not something I would’ve tried on my own because my perception of it is it takes a lot of strength to do the moves. And strength is not something I have right now,” said Trixie.\n\nOne of the things that motivated Trixie to try suspension training is that it’s an exercise you can do anywhere as long as you have the equipment needed. “You can take it anywhere. You can just purchase the equipment, you can hang it on the door, and do it while in the comforts of your own home,” she said.\n\nBecause of its unusual set-up, suspension training helps improve stability, increases muscular endurance, and is also the perfect full-body workout for people who are looking for something that’s quick and effective.\n\n“I definitely worked out a lot of parts of my body that doesn’t get worked out on a normal basis because you go on weird positions. You go on these different angles. A whole different target muscle would be affected,” shared Mara.\n\nAt your own pace\n\n“What I found suitable for me is that you don’t have to be perfect at it at once. I needed to adjust a bit, and see where I’m comfortable, and yet I still try to push myself and try to get the most out of the w",

Will small businesses benefit from TRAIN? Were your proposals considered to make sure we support the fast-growing micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the country?\n\nYes. I am very happy to say that our government listens to us taxpayers. When we proposed a simple and lower tax for small businesses, the Department of Finance (DOF) already included it in the pipeline for comprehensive tax reform.\n\nOur initial proposal is to introduce a flat 10% tax based on gross from small businesses. In the Senate version of TRAIN which was approved on final reading on November 28, they proposed an 8% flat tax in lieu of business and income tax for small businesses.\n\nHowever, after further study of our proposal, I realized that some large corporations are only paying an effective rate of 5% or lower due to tax planning or tax avoidance schemes, while the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is using as well a 5% threshold for value-added tax (VAT) and income tax payment. So, why not allow small businesses – which we proposed to be those making P5 million and below in annual gross sales – to pay a flat 5% tax to be filed and paid annually to encourage voluntary compliance?\n\nFurther, as reiterated in our letter to our senators, we are proposing an exclusive Salary Tax table so we can collect more from self-employed individuals and professionals with the simple and lower tax rate of 5% and 15%, respectively.\n\nIn an interview, you were quoted as saying that self-employed individuals and professionals are not paying the right taxes. Is it true that only employees are burdened by our high income tax rate?\n\nBased on the presentation of Marikina 2nd District Representative Miro Quimbo during our Tax Forum early this year, he highlighted that 99% of employees are paying taxes while only less than ",

In its wake, it left towns that have been devastated by winds, heavy rain, flooding, and landslides. Bridges have been swept away and ports shut down because of strong waves that can easily capsize even large ferries. One of these ports that have been closed down by the storm is the one located in the small coastal town of Matnog in Sorsogon.\n\nMatnog is the primary crossing point for travelers on their way by land and sea from Manila going to the Visayan provinces of Samar and Leyte. In 2013, when Typhoon Yolanda made landfall in the Philippines, a large part of the aid that was sent to affected areas passed through the crumbling pier in Matnog Port.\n\nFor the past 4 days that tropical depression Urduja has been battering the eastern coastline of the Philippines, authorities have shut down the Matnog port, stranding up to 7,000 passengers who are still sitting in buses, cars, and trucks on the highway leading to the port. By this time, many of the people who are stranded there have already ran out of food, water, money. Most of their mobile phones are either out of power or have no more telephone credits to make calls or send text messages.

The annual Search forms part of CSC’s Honor Awards Program (HAP) and the awards to be given out are the highest and most coveted recognition given by the government to individuals or group of individuals who have excelled or shown outmost dedication and commitment in public service.\n\nAll government workers in the career and non-career service including appointive barangay may be nominated.

One look at the Ceres Negros roster and you can see talent overflowing. It almost seems unnecessary to have that many skilled, high-priced players on your squad.\n\nBut the past few weeks have shown that if Ceres really wanted to win a title, they had to pay for excess quality. Most teams would not have been able to cope with the season-ending injuries to Manny Ott, their slick-passing midfielder, and goalscoring machine Fernando Rodriguez. But the Negrenses kept trucking along, out-playing Kaya 3-1 over two legs then routing Cebu on Saturday.\n\nIain Ramsay and Bienve Marañon picked up the slack in the scoring department, while Stephan Schrock and Junior Muñoz assisted in the final. Global actually had plenty of chances in the first half and could have made a game of it, but their defense froze under the Panaad floodlights.\n\nThis team was built for silverware, and after an underwhelming regular season (they even lost to JPV Marikina) the squad delivered when it mattered.\n\nOne word about Schrock: we all know that he can make pinpoint, perfectly-weighted passes. But on Saturday we witnessed him do that with a huge puddle in the way. No doubt he has seen a lot in his long career, including his share of waterlogged pitches. See it on this clip.\n\nGlobal Cebu showed plenty of character this season. The bridesmaids can take a bow. They succeeded off the field by drawing the biggest paying crowds among all the clubs. On the field they battled back as the fourth seed to beat top-seeded Meralco to make the final. They also came from a goal down twice against Albirex Niigata Singapore in the Singapore Cup final only to lose the shootout 3-1.\n\nWith a new ow",

Recto Hospital in Infanta, Quezon.\n\nThe government has advised Filipinos planning to return to their home provinces for Christmas to do so earlier than usual to avoid severe weather conditions.\n\nThe Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands on the Pacific typhoon belt, is plagued by poor sea transport, with badly regu",

According to Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark in the HBO series, the 8th and final season of the series will be out in 2019.\n\n“Yeah, I’m really excited. Game of Thrones comes out in 2019. Dark Phoenix is in November [2018],” Sophie said in an interview with Variety.\n\nWhile HBO has not confirmed the news, the longer wait time for the 8th season is not surprising. The upcoming season will have just 6 episodes in total, though each one will last an hour and a half long.\n\nWe’re ready to bet that HBO will not be holding back on special effects on this one, as CGI-heavy elements such as dragons, wildfire, and a fleet of whitewalkers gain a bigger role in the story.\n\nAs the final season, it’s also meant to tie up quite a handful of story lines – which means some tricky narrative navigation on the part of the writers.\n\nThis means that it might very well be more than a year’s wait before fans see new episodes of the show, whose most recent season finale saw two beloved characters unknowingly committing incest, a long-held fan theory finally being confirmed, and the Wall crumbling with the help of a zombified ice dragon. – .com",

When you are old, you are also in a better position to observe the changes in the manner Christmas is celebrated even as the basics of the Christian tradition remains.\n\nI spent my childhood Christmases in our old place in Sitio Kawayan, Barangay Sambag 2 in Cebu City, the community located in the innermost part of B. Rodriguez Extension. The place was much different then, less populated and more innocent. We knew most of the families in the village and most of the children where our friends and acquaintances. That made doing the rituals—from caroling to exploding firecrackers—personally satisfying.\n\nThe biggest change in the community now is its bursting population, which makes celebrating Christmas more intense and chaotic. The street that penetrates the lower portion of Sitio Kawayan has become one busy thoroughfare full of passing vehicles and trisikads and, yes people. Some houses are still able to mount sound systems and be festive on the street but the celebration has to rise above the din and frenzy of a cramped place filled with people many of whom you can’t identify.\n\nIn school, Christmas celebrations were simple. I remember going to the nearest store near our school (City Central School in the elementary days and Southwestern University in High School) to hunt for the best cheap Christmas cards to give to classmates, specifically to my “crush.” Or we would be told to fashion our own cards and be creative.\n\nI notice that only few of the young ones are into Christmas card hunting nowadays. Like the snail mail and telegram, Christmas cards have succumbed to advancement in technology. The bustle of the giving of Christmas cards (it’s now electronic cards or e-cards) has shifted to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms: free and easy to send but vica",

The word “emperor” reminds us that our country was once at war with Japan because of the order of the “emperor.” Peace time in the Philippines ended a few weeks before Christmas in 1941.\n\nJapan sided with the Axis against Allied Powers to pursue its ambitious expansion in Asia. The Land of the Rising Sun is calling the war a campaign for a “Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere. It is intended to overshadow the socio-political ploy of America for the Asians, “Benevolent Assimilation”.\n\nIn December 1941, Japanese aircraft attacked US military bases in Hawaii, Siam, Malaya, Singapore, the Philippines and other US territories in Asia. A whole generation of Filipinos stood ready to fight alongside their American “protectors.” (History could attest to that.) Little did they know that the United States War Department had long decided that the islands in the Philippines were neither defensible nor worth defending.\n\nOur country was just there “to upset the enemy’s time table.” We were just made to fight. No ship, no plane, no American soldiers were to reach the Philippines until three years later. As President Truman said, “A sacrifice to America’s state of unpreparedness.” The Japanese made an “all-out campaign to erase the Filipino habit of reliance upon Western nations.”\n\nSo, how did we celebrate Christmas under the noses of the Japanese? The Japs introduced their “sushi” and “tempura” (not hotdogs and hamburger). God was still in the mind of the Filipinos for Christmas… that little naked Jesus wrapped with a piece of cloth.\n\nChristmas was survival and there was the specter of hunger. The “burgis” of Negros stockpiled on food and other necessities… bath soap, oatmeal, corned beef. Here in Silay, some “hacenderos” left their mansions in the poblacion and stayed in their haciendas. Their “muchahos” butchered pigs and salted them in big earthen jars. Carabao’s meat were made into “tapa” (kusahos).\n\nMy fa",

This is Espino’s reaction to President Duterte’s dismissal of about 90 police scalawags, including senior officers, whom he “gangster cops.”\n\nIs Espino sure about his statement? How do you define “gangster”? Answer: gang member, hoodlum, racketeer, robber, thug, law breaker or criminal. Don’t tell me that no policeman in Central Visayas falls under those definitions. Any policeman involved in whatever shenanigan is considered a gangster.\n\nSome policemen who are in the president’s list as drug protectors or who are actively involved in the illegal drug trade are still assigned here, although some have been relieved or are dead. So, how do we classify them? Aren’t they gangsters? If a policeman is receiving a monthly protection money from either druglords and gambling lords, is he not considered as gangster?\n\nAnd don’t tell me no policeman in the region is “on the take” for protecting illegal activities. Even Espino was placed under investigation when he was newly assigned here because somebody texted Malacañang’s hot line that he is on the take from gambling lords, although he was cleared.\n\nIs Espino sure that there is no policeman here who serves as a henchman of politicians or businessmen? Is he sure that no cop serves as bodyguard and “go-between” of known druglords? What about those escorting smugglers? I suggest that Espino should check first his facts.\n\nBy the way, I received a “white paper” from concerned PRO 7 personnel who are privy to what’s happening inside the regional command and the alleged conduct of Espino. I refer the letter first to the public information officer of PRO 7 for Espino to react before I publish it here or discuss",

The four-day testing showed that all the stamps were fake, according to the BIR.\n\nManinang, according to BIR, did not declare or register the said business with BIR. As a result, he failed to pay the annual registration fee according to the BIR.\n\n“He was also not given authority to print receipts for his undertakings. As such, the receipts being used and issued by him in connection with the sale of the cigarettes were considered unregistered receipts,” the BIR said.\n\nThe BIR said that Maninang evaded the payment of correct taxes amounting to a total deficiency of P12,447,000 inclusive of increments.\n\nThe case against Maninang is the 110th filed under the Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) program of the BIR and also a RATE case of Revenue Region No. 4.",

It warned that US-Chinese economic relations were likely to face \"even more pressure and challenges.\"\n\nTrump's report Monday hit a series of sore spots for Beijing. It affirmed ties with Taiwan, the self-ruled island the mainland claims as its territory, and pledged to \"re-energize our alliances\" with Southeast Asian governments, some of which have conflicts with China over claims to portions of the South China Sea.\n\nThe United States and China share one of the world's biggest trading relationships and cooperate in areas from clean energy to public health. But Beijing sees Washington as an obstacle to its ambitions to be East Asia's dominant power, and strains over Taiwan, trade, technology policy and the South China Sea are growing.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington called on the US government to discard \"old thinking.\"\n\n\"It is selfish to put your national interest above other countries' interest and the mutual interest of the international community. It will lead the United States to isolationism,\" the embassy said in a statement.\n\n\"The Chinese side is willing to have peaceful coexistence with all countries of the world including the United States on the basis of mutual respect,\" it said. \"The United States should also adapt and accept China's development.\"\n\nUS officials are uneasy about Beijing's rising military spending — already the world's second-highest behind Washington.

None had dementia upon entering the study.\n\nParticipants completed questionnaires that asked how often they ate certain foods, including spinach, kale, collard greens and lettuce. They also had their thinking and memory skills tested once a year.\n\nPeople who ate the most greens averaged about 1.3 servings per day. Those on the opposite end of the spectrum ate 0.1 servings per day. A serving is about a half cup, cooked.\n\nPeople who ate at least one serving daily “had a slower rate of decline on tests of memory and thinking skills than people who never or rarely ate these vegetables,” said the study.\n\nThese results persisted even after researchers accounted for factors like smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, education level and mental and physical exercise.\n\n“These observations are consistent with a broader body of evidence suggesting that people adhering to a Mediterranean diet may reduce their risk of dementia,” said David Llewellyn, senior research fellow in clinical epidemiology at the University of Exeter, in England, who was not involved in the study.\n\nOne key aspect of the so-called Mediterranean diet is consum",

This variety which was brought to the Philippines through the initiative of Dr. Agustin Molina Jr., then the Regional Coordinator for Asia Pacific of Bioversity International, has become the darling of smallhold as well as big time growers in Mindanao.\n\nThe development of this very promising variety could be said to be the result of a well-orchestrated cooperation of various stakeholders in the banana industry that include government agencies, big and small scale banana farmers, research institutions, NGOs, academe and even international partners.\n\nIn 2005, Dr. Molina saw an urgent need for a solution to the virulent Fusarium Wilt disease that was threatening the banana industry in Mindanao which has been bringing into the country about $1 billion a year. The virulent TR4 was first observed in the highland areas in Calinan, Davao City, in 2000 but no one suspected it was TR4 because a milder strain of this disease has been attacking the Cavendish bananas since the 70s. Then sporadic infection occurred in the traditional production areas in the lowland, particularly in Mandug in Davao City, especially around the river that brought spores of the disease from Calinan.\n\nBy 2005, the disease was alarmigly spreading and really causing sever losses. Much earlier, Dr. Molina said, TR4 had wiped out the Cavendish plantations of Chiquita Brands and other multinationals in Indonesia and Malaysia. They had hoped to produce bananas for the expanding market in the Middle East but they had to abandon their projects because of TR4. Thus the new epidemics of TR4 was a real concern to the survival of the important source of foreign exchange and livelihoods of 320,000 people dir",

Start by decluttering all the excess items in your kitchen that you no longer need, such as the old spices, condiments, and canned goods in your cupboards and pantries, as well as unused kitchen items you never seem to have any use for from your countertops. You may also try re-arranging your items in the pantry or cupboard to make room for all the items you need when you begin preparing food for the reunions.\n\nThrow out what must be thrown out\n\nWe are all guilty of this but, we have often failed to throw out grocery items in the fridge until we need to. Look in the bins, chillers, and freezers to see if there are food items that you need to throw away. Also, look in the containers of food in the refrigerator compartment to see if there’s something you can’t eat anymore. Disposing of old, stale food will not only free up space when you store freshly cooked food during the parties but more important, it will prevent contamination of clean food.\n\nThe last thing you want is for you to be preparing a meal only to realize you are out of a key ingredient. This is not only inconvenient, it also messes up your schedule and wreaks havoc on your workflow. As you clean and declutter, check your cupboards and pantries to know if you still have essentials, such as dry goods, herbs and spices, condiments, basic ingredients, and the l",

This is because women who get pregnant at such a young age are more prone to pregnancy-related complications. Among these are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, and infections.\n\n\nIn developing countries, the same organization says that 1 out of 7 girls marry before they turn 15.

The number of cases also contributes 20 percent to the total number of maternal deaths in the country.\n\nSuch teenage pregnancy cases are allegedly responsible for the 500,000 to 800,000 cases of induced abortion that occur every year in the country.\n\nIncreased effort\n\nMaternal health advocacy groups often argue that the governme",

There was Dalin Sarmiento, who sought the help of Gabriela in publicizing her complaint against an abusive film director; the activist-nun Sister Mary John Mananzan, who curiously played the fictional Sister Stella L. (a film character from Mike de Leon’s film of the same name that was reportedly loosely based on Sister Mary John herself) in a skit; and television personality Heart Evangelista-Escudero, who represented the vice-presidential candidate and gave praise to Gabriela’s work.\n\nPoliticians who spoke to court the audience’s votes included representatives of senatorial candidates Susan Ople and Win Gatchalian, as well as candidates Tito Sotto and, of course, Makabayan’s Neri Colmenares. The Liwasang Bonifacio stage belonged to presidential candidate Grace Poe, who (rightly or wrongly) compared her Supreme Court victory with that of all Filipino women.\n\nAll these, however, merely prefaced the “real” Women’s Day protest, when thousands of women and men marched from Liwasang Bonifacio to Mendiola.\n\nIn what would be one of the last major protest actions against the current president, Gabriela once more brought to the Palace gates the people’s issues, from the escalating number of cases of physical and sexual violence against women to economic violence–the increasing poverty and landlessness under a regime that only intensified its implementation of neoliberal policies that mainly benefits the few rich and foreign monopoly capitalists.",

He had just recovered from a bout with dengue after leading La Salle to the UAAP Finals against Ateneo. Mbala, unsure about whether the UAAP Board will allow him to play his last year of eligibility, sought permission from La Salle’s benefactor San Miguel Corp. chairman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. to explore his options and received his blessings before leaving.\n\nCojuangco told Mbala that no matter what happens, his scholarship at La Salle will be waiting for him to earn his business management degree. An honor student, the Cameroonian said he hopes to eventually complete his studies and graduate from La Salle. He is about 60 units short of finishing up, roughly 1 1/2 years of classes.\n\nUAAP executive director Rebo Saguisag recently said the rule providing a seven-year eligibility limit from high school graduation will be reimposed next season after a two-year suspension. Unless the rule is repealed, Mbala would not be able to play his last year of UAAP eligibility. La Salle officials argued that reimposing the limit is discriminatory against Mbala because with the K-to-12 system, the rule has become academic.\n\n“They (the UAAP) don’t want me to play anymore,” said Mbala in tears. “They even questioned my MVP award, saying it is prejudicial to locals. I’ve spent the best years of my life in the Philippines and they treat me like someone who doesn’t deserve to play.” Since Mbala took his first MVP trophy last year, no foreign athlete had won the award in 36 years. The only other foreign MVP was FEU’s Anthony Williams in 1981. When Mbala bagged back-to-back MVP honors, detractors called for separate categories to distinguish locals from for",

Except that’s probably what it felt like for Ebenezer Scrooge; but instead of distant relatives, they were ghosts.\n\nBut really, Christmas can be a pretty dark time. It’s a season of in-your-face togetherness. We’re forced to resolve conflict and rebuild bonds amongst ourselves. Practically a big despidida for the past year, we unwillingly fall into a state of retrospection. We’re faced with the big question humankind has been asking itself since the conception of Christmas itself: Have we been naughty or nice? (And we don’t always like the answer, do we?)\n\nThis year’s A Christmas Carol toys with these more nightmarish aspects of Christmas. Although it begins with giddy, uplifting production numbers like Jolly, Rich and Fat, it quickly spirals into the dark but kooky Link by Link à la The Nightmare Before Christmas until finally, it dives headlong into the haunting visit by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be in Dancing on Your Grave. The extra grit is thoroughly enjoyable, and a much welcome shade to the classic production.\n\nMiguel Faustman is riveting as Scrooge. During the intermission, I heard a mom tell her kid: “Scrooge is the bad guy.” But with Faustman’s portrayal, that’s really not a judgment that crosses your mind. Faustman’s Scrooge is, well, Scroogey in every sense but you forget that the moment you witness just how much life has broken him. How can you give when so much has been taken from you? Ultimately, A Christmas Carol is about how it’s never too late for a broken soul to heal. Faustman is deeply affecting, and I highly doubt I’ll ever see a better Scrooge. Apart from Faustman, the show is further bolstered by top-class performances by veterans Noel Rayos as Jacob Marley/Mr. Fezziwig and Franco Laurel as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Rissey Reyes is also stunning in her wordless haunting of Ebenezer. Over",

There are people who ignore disaster risk warnings, but it’s not impossible to get them out of harm’s way when the risk is heightened by a weather disturbance. Barangay officials in particular are supposed to be familiar with communities in their jurisdiction and should know enough about weather disturbances in this country to provide timely warning about potential mudslides.\n\nThere have been deadly mudslides in recent years to give urgency to such warnings.

It will take effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the TRAIN, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAbout 70 percent of revenues from the TRAIN will be used to bankroll the Duterte administration’s ambitious infrastructure drive.\n\nThe Department of Finance earlier said the new excise tax system for automobiles was not just a revenue-enhancing measure but also a way to address pollution and congestion. According to a survey done by the DOF, 80 percent of families in the Philippines do not own cars.\n\nTo encourage cleaner transportation, electric vehicles are exempt while hybrid cars will be taxed at half rates. Meanwhile, pick-ups, which are commonly used by businessmen and entrepreneurs for commercial and agricultural purposes, are excluded as well.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of tax rates adjustments for cars under TRAIN:\n\nThe DOF earlier flagged what it called “misleading social media and news reports” on the price increase of cars under TRAIN, and assured the public that there would be “no doubling of car prices” as the tax hike would be “moderate, not extreme.”\n\nThe DOF likewise pointed out that with the substantial cuts in personal income tax rates, “Filipinos would have more money in their pockets, making entry-level cars more affordable for them.”\n\n“The tax base is not the retail price but the manufacturing or importation p",

The contracts were for nine flood control projects and the rehabilitation of two bridges.\n\nThe ombudsman said the local officials awarded the contracts despite a notice from the Department of Budget and Management that it recalled the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) of the province’s calamity funds amounting to a total of P480.7 million for failing to comply with certain requirements and guidelines.\n\nThe infrastructure projects were supposed to benefit residents affected by Typhoon Sendong in December 2011 and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake in February 2012.\n\nMendez and Reyes were also charged with 11 counts of falsification of public documents for certifying that the funds were available despite the recall of the SARO.\n\nThe ombudsman recommended bail of P330,000 each for Degamo and Alpuerto and P594,000 each for Mendez and Reyes.\n\nDegamo had been earlier charged with graft and 11 counts of malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents also in connection with the alleged misuse of calamity funds.\n\nThe ombudsman ordered Degamo’s dismissal over the alleged anomalous release of P10 million of the provincial government’s intelligence funds in 2013.",

It was a new challenge.\n\n“Gusto ko rin naman makagawa ng pelikula na pwedeng panoorin ng mga pamangkin ko,”said Direk Chris who was so amazed with Baste’s natural flair for acting. “This movie is for the whole family.”\n\n“Mahirap patawanin ang bata ha?

It’s very exciting.”\n\n“I think the freshness of the material is one strong come-on. Personally, I am excited to do a genre like this: a family movie sans fantasy and special effects. It’s a breather for me, actually. This is the perfect movie date for every Filipino family come Christmas day.”\n\nWhen Bossing Vic and Direk Chris were conceptualizing the project, they saw to it that they have something new to offer moviegoers, not the same stuff that Bossing Vic did in past MMFF editions.\n\n“Direk and I carefully brainstormed and I am so glad and proud with the outcome.

The concert shares the name with his sophomore album and its title track Hey, released that same day in record stores and digital platforms. Moments before the start of his show, a countdown timer dominated the screens and the crowd grew restless by the minute. One could barely see the stage, with only a few seconds left before the opening number, because people were craning their necks high to finally see Matteo take the stage.\n\nHe entered in typical pop-star fashion, having his own momentous opening of doors blanketed by smoke as he emerged in an all-white outfit. The electric opening numbers of Shawn Mendes’ There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back and Calvin Harris’ How Deep is Your Love set the mood for the next two hours — fun and energetic performances that showcased Matteo’s vocal chops, dancing skills and occasionally gave the audience a little tease of his well-toned triathlete built as he moved comfortably in a muscle sando.\n\n‘Wag Ka Nang Umuwi, the first song off his album performed that night, is a poignant ballad of someone never wanting his significant other to leave just yet. Matteo expounded, “Whenever you are with that person you love, it’s as if you don’t want the day to end. You’d want to spend that extra five or 10 minutes with her and sometimes you’d want to say “please ‘wag ka nang umuwi,” he ended with a boyish grin.\n\nMartin Nievera, known to be Matteo’s mentor, made a surprise appearance and brought the house down with his antics and adlibs. He advised the young performer, “You need a song that will make them remember you for the rest of your life — that every time you sing this song they will only think of you.” To which Matteo responded, “How do we do that?” Martin teased, “You need a Louie Ocampo hit,” and proceeded to sing his own classic by the great composer, Say That You Love Me.\n\nHey Matteo was a show of grea",

While the celebration has been commercialized and somewhat adulterated by many other practices, it is still most appropriate and necessary event for all of us to commemorate because it is the greatest manifestation of God’s immeasurable love for us by sending His only begotten Son in the form of human flesh and blood to suffer and die so that we may regain the life of eternal bliss.\n\nLately, questions and doubts have been raised regarding some details of the event particularly the exact date when Christ was born. Skeptics say that there is no Biblical basis for fixing December 25 as Christmas day and that this is just a pagan invention. This aspect is not so important however. Most important is the Biblical fact that Christ is born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem. We just have to focus on this infallible truth so that we can experience true Christmas joy.\n\nAdmittedly, the joy of the occasion has not yet sunk deep nor has it been truly felt by most of us because of the series of devastations in our country particular the recent landslide in Biliran Leyte that caused the loss of so many lives and enormous damage to property. It is really hard to have a “Merry Christmas” with the thought that most of our countrymen in that part of our land suffer not only the tragic loss of lives and property but also the harshness of living in poverty and want. At this time, what we can do is to pray that God help them and care for them in their hour of misery.\n\nBut real joy may also be still eluding us simply because we look at the occasion from its purely materialistic aspect brought about by too much commercialism which in turn has even caused heavier traffic. We are now more influenced by the modern ways of celebrating the event where Santa Claus and his reindeers have replaced the Belen or the Nativity Scene as the more popular Christmas décor; w",

It remains one of the most powerful tools of communication, creating a sense of enchantment, inspiration, motivation, even fear among its listeners, as a story enlivens a person’s brain in many ways.\n\nGrowing up, I had always been an avid consumer of stories. I was riveted to the edge of my seat whenever a narrator told a story with gusto. I loved to immerse myself in television and film, and I escaped often to the pages of my books. As I began to feel more and more invested in the characters of these stories, I longed to be more like their heroines. But there was a problem: I wanted to be exactly like them — except I couldn’t, because the girls in the stories that I read were oftentimes very different from me; they were created by westerners, with western sensibilities in mind. I could relate to their universal themes — love, friendship, coming-of-age stories, adventure, drama — but when it came to nuances and cultural proclivities, I could only use my imagination.\n\nCut to today: It’s 2017, and storytelling has finally embraced the “Other” voice. Early this December, the Singapore Media Festival (SMF) 2017 celebrated exactly that: the best of Asian storytelling, gathering over 20,000 media and creative professionals, industry thought-leaders, and fans of television and film from around the world to give credence to the Other voice. The Festival assembled both established and emerging players to create opportunities and possibilities for fresh and innovative content. It was a hub for all media, and the place was buzzing with incredible potential.\n\nHosted by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), the festival highlighted key events such as the Asian Television Awards (ATA), the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF), and the SMF Ignite, to name a few.\n\nOne of the most talked-about events in the festival was the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF), which wrapped up with a rec",

This is usually done by handing out paper bills, usually freshly-printed ones withdrawn from the bank.\n\nWith PayMaya’s digital aguinaldo service, giving cash gifts is made easier as it can be done anytime and anywhere.\n\nTo send cash gifts, the sender would need to link his or her PayMaya account to Messenger by chatting with @PayMayaOfficial.\n\nIf the sender has no PayMaya account, he or she can sign up for an account using any mobile number from all networks using Messenger.\n\nOnce the account is linked to Messenger, they can upgrade their accounts to use the ‘Send Aguinaldo’ feature and load up their accounts via PayMaya’s more than 15,000 top-up partners nationwide.\n\nAfter chatting with @PayMayaOfficial in Messenger, the sender simply needs to click the “Promos & Gifts” tab, and click the “Send Aguinaldo” option.\n\nThe sender will then have to choose the Facebook friend who will receive the cash gift, enter the amount of money to be sent, and swipe right or left to choose the perfect design to go along with the money gift.\n\nAfter tapping the “Pay” button, the user will be asked to enter their Facebook password, after which the money will be sent to the recipient.\n\nThe feature is currently available to Android users and those with upgraded PayMaya accounts.\n\nOnce th",

    "body": "The tax reform law just signed by President Duterte and expected to swing into effect in 2018 has drawn mixed reactions from the Filipino public. That is to be expected of course. Things do not always seem the same thing to different people. Anyway, the tax reform law made many people happy with its substantial reduction in income taxes, but the trade-off consisting of hefty taxes elsewhere also made a lot of others apprehensive.\n\nBut here is where the new law might emerge in a positive light amid the overall scheme of things: Whether we like it or not, whether there is a new tax reform law that reduces income taxes or not, prices in virtually everything will always be going up. From oil products to sweetened drinks to brand new cars –there is not going to be any relief from the relentless assault of escalating prices.\n\nThese continuously soaring prices can come as a huge tidal wave, as feared by many as a consequence of the reduction in income taxes, or as slight but steady add-ons that a people rendered numb and callous by their inexorable certainty may not readily notice until the reality hits them when they get their bills. But as sure as the sun rises in the east, the increases will come to everything that people cannot do without.\n\nAnd so, to the ever practical Filipino, the situation is ultimately made very clear. Given the absolute certainty of price increases in absolutely everything, would he still rather be given some relief in his income taxes or not? The obvious answer is of course, as Cebuanos would say in their very precise language –maayo na lang.\n\nWhether there is a tax break or not, prices will still always increase. So “maayo na lang” that there is a tax break. Or as Cebuanos are bound to add: “Ha-i labi og wala.” It is therefore always better to consider things in their broader perspective.\n\nIt is always better to weigh the pros and cons. But more importantly, it is always better to maintain a little bias toward the positive.\n\nFor there is no gov",

Thereafter, export growth is expected to be maintained at nine percent from 2020 to 2022.\n\n“This is consistent with the observation that global trade is picking up, so we adjusted our exports (assumptions),” Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, who heads the DBCC, had said then.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country’s total export sales in October rose 6.6 percent to $5.37 billion from $5.04 billion in the same month last year. This marked the 11th consecutive month of positive growth in exports.\n\nHowever, imports still continued to outpace exports, amounting to $8.21 billion, or 13.1 percent up from $7.26 billion the previous year.\n\nThis resulted in a trade deficit of $2.84 billion in October, higher than the $2.22 billion deficit in October last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Beltran expects other macroeconomic assumptions of the DBCC to improve after its meeting today. However, he declined to name which indicators and projections would be changed.\n\n“It will be announced later depending on their decision but all are improvements over the previous (assumptions),” Beltran said.\n\nMeanwhile, Diokno said in a separate interview other agenda in today’s meeting include the review of the government’s 2017 performance, discussion of the Tax Reform for Accele",

Many of them are bakwits (evacuees) from militarized communities.\n\nYesterday’s activity included games and cultural performances that once again amplified the call to end militarization of Lumad communities, martial law in Mindanao, and the ongoing military food blockade in Lumad communities Surigao del Sur.\n\nThe Paskuhang Bakwit was a kick-off of the Metro Manila-based students’ call to “bring the Lumad home.” In a statement, Bridgette Quinto, Manila Youth Act Now president, said there will be a similar gift-giving event on summer vacation next year which will include even more youth groups.\n\n“We have gathered here today to live the spirit of Christmas—giving the gift of solidarity and unity in action,” said Quinto during the protest action before the program proper.\n\nQuinto said since martial law was declared in Mindanao there are at least 90 cases of extrajudicial killings, 430 cases of trumped up charges, and forcible evacuation of thousands of Lumad and Moro communities that have been reported.\n\n“Martial Law in Mindanao has brought nothing but terror for the people in the countryside, and now that its implementation has been extended until the end of 2018, the Lumad have nothing to hold on to but their struggle for land and life,” Quinto said.\n\nMore than 40 organizations from high schools and universities across Metro Manila participated in Paskuhang Bakwit.\n\n“Christmas is a season of love, and we are calling out to the youth all over the country to give love to our fellow Filipinos by being one with the fight for their rights and welfare,” Quinto said.",

The latest is at a speech he gave to the annual gathering of LGBT in Davao City where he accused the NPA of going around “molesting or sexually abusing” women in the countryside and even “stealing” the women from their husbands.\n\nBut how can a home-grown revolutionary movement comprised mainly of peasants, waging guerrilla warfare in the rural areas, survive for close to five decades if there is any truth to this outrageous accusation? One might conclude that Mr. Duterte has lost it. (Some say too much Fentanyl). Then again, there seems to be method to the madness: the terror tagging of the CPP-NPA is a glaring example.\n\nMr. Duterte has flip-flopped more than once but this is major. From an avowed fellow socialist and Leftist who understood the social roots of rebellion; who considered a renowned NPA commander murdered by the military as his close friend; who gave support and succor to beleaguered NPA fighters; and who promised to end the longest running armed conflict in Asia through peace negotiations — Mr. Duterte now has nothing good to say about the CPP-NPA.\n\nIt is as if all he has to do is change his mind, or his rhetoric, to change the highly political, in fact revolutionary, character of the CPP-NPA overnight.\n\nThus upon his declaration that he was scuttling peace talks with the revolutionary umbrella formation, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), Mr. Duterte announced he would deny the CPP-NPA any political legitimacy by following the US lead in labelling the movement as “terrorist.” He issued Proclamation 374 declaring the CPP-NPA a “designated, identified terrorist organization under Republic Act (RA) No. 10168.”\n\nSince the “terrorist” la",

The government troops were a composite team of soldiers of the Philippine Army’s 27th and 33rd infantry battalions (IBs) and the Philippine Marines.\n\nKarapatan identified the victims as Victor Danyan, his son Victor Danyan Jr., Artemio Danyan, Pato Celardo, Samuel Angkoy, To Diamante, Bobot Lagase, and Mateng Bantal. The two wounded were Luben Laod and Teteng Laod. As of press time, a quick reaction team is still in the community to gather more information.\n\n“This is by far the worst attack against the indigenous peoples,” said Datu Jerome Succor Aba, co-chairperson of the national minority alliance, Sandugo. The group held a press conference in Quezon City yesterday, Dec. 5, to denounce the massacre.\n\nAba said 140 Lumad farmer families in the area have reclaimed 300 hectares of their ancestral lands from the mega-corporation David M. Consunji Inc. (DMCI), which displaced them to use the lands to plant coffee for Nestle.\n\n“The residents were about to harvest their crops in their farms that day…Around 300 hectares have already been replaced with corn and other sustenance food planted by the rightful owners – Lumad communities,” Aba said.\n\nAs the Lumad farmers resisted DMCI’s attempts to take the land, Aba said, the military branded them as New People’s Army (NPA) members.

On 9 June 2014, the Sangguniang Bayan passed a resolution expressing the same sentiment. And on 16 October of the same year, the municipal government submitted a position paper further elaborating its position.\n\nThe position paper said Wao’s vote in the event of a plebiscite on the Bangsamoro should be counted separately from Lanao del Sur’s. It said doing otherwise “will result to injustice on our basic rights,” adding it was time to heed Wao’s voice which has been “suppressed by political boundaries”. It further cited that the manner of the plebiscites on the ARMM in 1989 and 2001 was “oppressive”, as the result was based on how the province voted as a whole and the “No” vote of the town was ignored.\n\nProf. Miriam Coronel-Ferrer, chair of the government peace panel during the Aquino III administration, offered a different argument, in a forum in Malaybalay City on 22 May 2014 attended by Bukidnon’s Catholic clergy. (Wao belongs to the Diocese of Malaybalay.) Citing Moro residents of Wao, Ferrer said [excluding the town from the Bangsamoro] would be an injustice to the hospitality of native inhabitants who welcomed the settlers to their place.\n\nWao, although part of Lanao del Sur, is inhabited predominantly by Christian settlers who now comprise at least 80 percent of the population. It became part of the ARMM by virtue of Republic Act 6374 of 1990 and RA 9054 of 2001 which expanded and strengthened the autonomous region. The rest of Lanao del Sur’s 39 mu",

We hope it’s a pleasurable and fun bidding experience for people who are going to attend,” he said.\n\nLike the previous live auto auctions of HMR since December 2016, consignors can expect this as a fitting venue to expose their assets to a large pool of prequalified bidders.\n\nBuyers that include car dealers and general public can indulge in having multiple options—from Ford Explorer, Suburban, Ford Everest, Toyota Vios, Mitsubishi Mirage and a lot more.\n\nAdhering to “as in, where is” price-point industry standards, they can enjoy cheaper prices for their chosen vehicles than going to a dealership.\n\nHMR has also made available to them its “Easy Financing” offering through its partners East West Bank, Security Bank and Global Dominion.\n\nAs a gesture of further appreciation to loyal followers, the anniversary-promo winner for the auction will be announced during the event and will be handed over with a cash price of P100,000.\n\nMuch to the delight of invited customers, business partners and even employees, raffle prizes and giveaways await them.\n\nHMR Auto Auction provides full-service asset-management solutions for clients requiring liquidation of their obsolete vehicles.\n\nEstablished over 23 years ago, it pioneered live auctions for general merchandise, consumer goods, as well as industrial plant and heavy equipment.\n\nThe company then branched ou",

The currency will be undermined as the current-account deficit widens, while the Central Bank is slow to raise interest rates from a record low, strategists and fund managers say.\n\n“The peso remains vulnerable,” said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in Manila. “The external payments position will likely deteriorate further as more economic activity fuels demand for capital equipment and consumer goods,” he said, forecasting the currency will end next year at 52 per dollar.\n\nThe peso has whipsawed this year: sliding to an 11-year low of 51.85 per dollar in October before paring losses to trade at 50.250 on Friday. It is still down 1.1 percent since the start of January.\n\nThe Philippines will post a current-account deficit of $100 million this year and that will swell to $700 million in 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) forecast this month. The shortfall is set to increase as President Duterte’s $180-billion infrastructure plan pushes up imports.\n\n“The Philippines doesn’t get a lot of investor inflow, and this is one of the biggest problems and why it tends to weaken off more aggressively than its regional peers when sentiment dies,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. in Singapore. “It is still going to be the local whipping boy in the region.”\n\nA forecast of 51 per dollar for year-end 2018 may be a bit optimistic if anything, he said.\n\nPhilippine policy-makers have been in no rush to raise rates even after the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark this month for the third time this year.

The banking products offered in branch-lite units shall exclude those suited for sophisticated clients with high-risk tolerance,” the BSP said in a statement.\n\nThe BSP also said the newly approved guidelines will address the situation where there are over 570 cities and municipalities with no banking presence.\n\n“With simplified and more flexible provisions, banks will be better able to expand in areas that are unbanked and underserved,” the BSP said.\n\nThe new guidelines also rationalize the current classifications of banking offices, such as extension offices, other banking offices, and microbanking offices under the branch-lite framework.",

    "body": "Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) seems to have become a buzzword in recent years, business has always been concerned about society and the environment. Their relationship is, ultimately, symbiotic: neither can or will a company thrive in a failing society, nor can a society prosper without a successful expanding economy. Integrity, business ethics and anticorruption form part of cornerstones on which modern business is built.\n\nThe increasing globalization (hopefully with Trump as US president) of the world economy has led to significant changes in supply and value chains and in the division of labor. Doing business and manufacturing goods have become more complex, as enterprises wishing to do international business have to comply with more and more legal and ethical standards (the Philippines just added data privacy rules that will affect every organization). As a result, CSR has become a kind of voluntary necessity rather than an explicit choice. As Gawad Kalinga founder Tony Meloto said recently: “Mere charity is not working.” In order to succeed globally, businesses have to respond to certain expectations and align their strategies and operations to universal values.\n\nThese expectations and values become especially evident when tragic incidents prove weak standards, like the collapse of the garment factory in Bangladesh or the fire in the plant in Valenzuela, where many workers lost their lives. Manufacturers came under fire for their supply-chain responsibility. Public pressure prompted companies to improve attention to safety requirements and labor/human-rights issues.\n\nBeyond human-rights issues, the public’s attention has also been drawn to questions of environmental sustainability. Environment Secretary Regina Paz L. Lopez has this high on her agenda. Many local and foreign businesses have responded to these concerns (already before the arrival of Lopez at the environment department).\n\nIt is against this background that many international initi",

Besides, why trouble yourself with skin aging when you can’t even see any visible evidence yet, right? But experts assert that your 20s is the right time to start your preventive anti-aging routine.\n\nIn an interview with InStyle, esthetician Renee Rouleau said, “Anti-aging products, particularly those with antioxidants, can be used as early as age 21, but the most important thing is to use anti-aging products that are appropriate for your skin type.\n\nA powerful antioxidant that helps prevent and repair skin damage is vitamin C. It is found in leafy vegetables and citrus fruits. We can take it in its natural form or in supplement form; and we can even apply it to our skin.\n\nSeveral anti-aging products harness the power of this antioxidant, but only few are able to take it a notch higher.\n\nKiehl’s has introduced recently its new and improved Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing Concentrate, which features a much powerful formulation with increased vitamin C and added hyaluronic acid.\n\n“Our previous formula only contains 10.5 percent vitamin C, but [after several formulation trials] we were able to increase it to 12.5 percent while keeping it stable,” Kiehl’s Philippines product manager Joan Hwang told MS Young Life.\n\nThe additional 2 percent come in the form of vitamin Cg or Ascorbyl Glucoside, which boosts the visible wrinkle reduction effect of vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid) over time. It is activated once it absorbs into the upper layers of the skin’s surface.\n\nWith vitamin C and vitamin Cg working together, Kiehl’s anti-aging serum promises to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles (even deep set wrinkles), visibly improve skin brightness, and boost skin’s surface quality. Despite the increased amount of vitamin C, the Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing Concentrate doesn’t have a stinging sensation, rather a pleasant warm sensation that’s suitable during the cold season.\n\nTo fu",

We have put together a very experienced team, and are looking forward to working closely together with the customer to deliver a new toll bridge that will benefit both local communities and the Philippines.”\n\nThe CCLEX allows for shipping traffic and the link is expected to serve at least 40,000 vehicles daily.The project is envisioned to decongest the traffic in the two existing bridges between Mactan and Cebu.

He is Emmanuel (God with us). Let us never lose hope,” he said in his Christmas 2017 message.\n\nPalma called on the faithful to cling to God, and to make room for Jesus in their hearts.\n\n“I would like you to reflect how the child Jesus was born in a crib surrounded by animals.

I hope, in our own little ways, we can be instruments of hope and joy to other people. Just as Jesus was a gift to us from God the Father, may we also become a gift to other people,” he said.\n\n“In that way, we can make our community, archdiocese, and country a better place to live in.

For 53-year-old Nanding Daclan, who worked as a checker in the famous hardware for thirteen years, the closure was tantamount to losing his job just a few days before Christmas. “What are we going to do now?,” Daclan wondered aloud in Cebuano. A father of four, Daclan is among an estimated 1,000 workers displaced after the Cebu City government fully enforced a closure order on Vic Enterprises yesterday. According to Daclan, even if management decides to move them to their Mandaue branch, not everyone can be accommodated. The company's 13 stores and warehouses, including its main branch in Barangay Mabolo, were shut down by a team from the City Legal Office, Cebu City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CCENRO) and the Prevention, Restoration, Order, Beautification, Enhancement (Probe) upon orders of Mayor Tomas Osmeña. Probe head Raquel Arce said they will assign personnel to monitor that Vic Enterprises will not resume operations. Tarpaulins announcing the closure were also placed outside the stores and warehouses. Arce explained that since the company voluntarily heeded the mayor's order, they found no need to padlock the establishments. Vic Enterprises was ordered closed by Osmeña for its failure to comply with several regulatory requirements and traffic regulations. Josephine Cayacap, secretary and accountant of Vic Enterprises said that all their stores and warehouses were already emptied on Wednesday. “Sayang gyud ni kay dugay na baya mi diri nagtrabaho. Dugay nako diri, almost 60 years na (What a waste, we've been working here for a long time. I've been here for almost 60 years) ,” said Cayacap. But Osmeña stood firm on his decision not to lift the closure order. “Vic Enterprises can pay them. Vic does at least 1 billion a month, plenty of money. So don't put the blame on me. They have violated the law, I have to close them ",

Its intraday low, meanwhile, stood at P50.26 against the greenback.\n\nDollars traded soared to $630.2 million from the $490.8 million that changed hands a session ago.\n\nA trader said the slight uptick of the peso yesterday was due to “profit taking ahead of the holiday season despite positive news regarding the US economy.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled US House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the US tax code in 30 years, sending a sweeping $1.5-trillion tax bill to President Donald J. Trump for his signature.\n\nIn sealing Mr. Trump’s first major legislative victory since he took office in January, Republicans steamrolled opposition from Democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class Americans.\n\nThe House approved the measure by 224-201, passing it for the second time in two days after a procedural foul-up forced another vote on Wednesday. The Republican-led Senate had passed it 51-48 in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, UnionBank of the Philippines (UnionBank) Chief Economist Ruben Carlo O. Asuncion noted that yesterday’s sideways movement can be attributed to continued optimism on the local tax reform bill.\n\n“[The] dollar was little changed, again [due to] optimism on the result of the tax reform,” Mr. Asuncion said, noting that the market is on a wait-and-see mode as President Rodrigo R.

TOMAS, BATANGAS—Economic growth in the industrial region where Lipa City is situated grew only by 4.8 percent in 2016, and has the agricultural sector to thank.\n\nThis is some 0.8 percentage points lower than the 5.6 gross regional domestic product (GRDP) the Calabarzon  registered in 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said.\n\nGRDP or Gross Regional Domestic Product measures the economic performance of a geographic region. GRDP covers the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within the region in a given period of time.\n\nThe three major economic sectors in which growth is computed are agriculture, industry and services.\n\nGRDP is usually reported in terms of growth rate and expressed in real terms or at constant prices. Annual growth rates then show if a regional economy grew faster, slower or declined.\n\nThe slowdown can be attributed to the slow growth of the region’s industrial and manufacturing sectors. PSA’s 2016 GRDP report said Calabarzon industrial sector grew by 3.7 percent in 2016, lower than its 5.7 percent growth in 2015\n\nManufacturing, for its part, also slowed down at 3.6 percent compared to previous year’s growth of 5.5 percent.\n\nThe slowdown can also be attributed to lower year-on-year growth rates in construction (2.5 percent in 2016 versus 7.2 percent in 2015) and mining and quarrying (1.8 percent in 2016 versus 17.9 percent in 2015).\n\nHowever, the electricity, gas and water sector grew faster at 7.5 percent, from the previous year’s 6.8 percent.\n\nWhile manufacturing and construction slowed, the agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (AHFF) sector grew by 3.4 percent last year, higher than the 2.6 percent in 2015.\n\n“We don’t have calamities anymore like the cocolisap, thus the growth (in the agriculture industry),” Banua says.\n\nIn 2015, the Agriculture and Forestry sub-sector had a higher growth of 5.9 percent.

It is a story for people for whom life is marked by its tragedies, loneliness, and rejection.\n\nThere is a reason why they say that Christmas is for children. The gifts, the reunions, and the long vacation make memories of Christmas happiest at childhood.\n\nBut something with adulthood transforms Christmas. A heartbreak, the loss of a loved one, or an illness that coincides with the season can suck the life out of it.\n\nFor those of us who have experienced a tragedy, no feast can bring back its joy. At best, Christmas is merely a moment of fleeting gladness.\n\nIn this light, Christmas has become an annual ritual of misery in which one is compelled to perform joy. Why not? Its bright lights have cast only shadows. The happiness of other people only deepens one's loneliness.\n\nThey know that Christmas is no longer merry. And attending Christmas parties has become a burden.\n\nChristmas trumps every other season. That is true as far as our culture is concerned.\n\nEaster, which is far more significant in the Christian annual cycle, does not even compare. We count down to the birth of Christ, but not to his death and resurrection.\n\nThat ours may be the longest Christmas season in the world is a testament to how much we value it.

This has taken place in a surreptitious manner.\n\nEvery sale at the mall, every Christmas party, and every gift exchange all bring us together. The irony, however, is that they have all created an atmosphere in which the things of Christmas have overshadowed its relationships.\n\nConsumption, festivities, and all the fanfare impress upon us that the busier it is, the merrier our C",

It’s set in a gloomy, gritty version of modern-day Los Angeles, reimagined so that fantasy creatures – orcs, fairies, and elves – coexist with humans.

Although the group supports the overall tax reform, they are against the provisions on sugary drinks, which they have dubbed as “anti-poor.”\n\nAccording to the group’s computations, 40% of the average sari-sari store owner’s daily income come from sales of sweetened drinks. PASCO adds that the proposal will make these products more expensive and therefore less appealing to ordinary consumers.\n\n“Paano na lamang po ang kabuhayan namin kapag naisabatas na ang dagdag buwis na ito? Nangangamba kami na tuluyan nang mawawala ang aming maliliit na negosyo,” PASCO said in a statement. (What will happen to our livelihood once the additional tax gets passed into law? We fear that our small businesses will die.)\n\nIn the past, netizens have also expressed concerns regarding statements that the tax will help curb sugar consumption among Filipinos.\n\nConsumer groups such as CitizenWatch and BK3 (Bantay Konsumer, Kalsada, Kuryente) have rallied behind the store owners, and called on the government to amend the proposed taxes.\n\nSo far, it seems like the Senate has listened.\n\nIn the Senate-approved version of the bill, in the first two years of the reform, drinks with c",

For some, it’s to be indispensible to the people they love.\n\nThis was the theme of Sun Life Financial’s latest collection of digital films, dubbed Sun Shorts 2.\n\nThe series was launched along with corresponding reaction videos from brand ambassadors Matteo Guidicelli, Judy Ann Santos, and Piolo Pascual last June 7 in Makati Shangri-La.\n\nThe short films, inspired by clients’ real-life stories, are about the ways we show love.\n\n“Waves,” directed by Zig Marasigan, tells the story of Marco and Amanda, a couple who met at the beach. By the end of summer, Amanda returns to the city, but Marco, a surfing instructor, stays behind. As with any long-distance relationship, issues of jealousy and distrust soon ensue.\n\nWhile struggling to keep their relationship above water, Marco unexpectedly dies. A distraught Amanda discovers a ring and a personal accident insurance wherein Marco named her as the beneficiary. With the money, she sets up a café by the beach – a dream the couple shared when Marco was still alive.\n\nAsked about his work on Waves, Zig said: “The thing about millennials is we are mistakenly characterized as individuals who don’t know what they want in life. What I feel is that anyone, regardless of age, be they a baby boomer or a millennial, can come to a point when they don’t know where to go. We only know what we want in life when we see it, or in the case of ‘Waves,’ when we meet them.”\n\nMatteo agreed with this sentiment, saying that that while millennials like him may be into social media, they also realize the importance creating personal connections.\n\nThe next short film, “She Said, She Said” tells two sides of a parent-child relationship.\n\nIt follows the struggles of a single mom as she tries to make a name for herself as a fashio",

The words \"lakers\", \"ferrari\", \"football\", \"soccer\", and \"jordan23\" also make an appearance in the top 100 list. Unfortunately, it may not always be advisable to refer to something you love as a password as they are easy guesses by would-be hackers.\n\n“Unfortunately, while the newest episode may be a fantastic addition to the Star Wars franchise, ‘starwars’ is a dangerous password to use,” said Morgan Slain, CEO of SplashData.\n\n“Hackers are using common terms from pop culture and sports to break into accounts online because they know many people are using those easy-to-remember words,\" Slain warned.\n\nSplashData also offered other advice to remain safe from hackers, issuing reminders about ways to strengthen passwords, typically the keys to accounts online.\n\n\"Use passphrases of twelve characters or more with mixed types of characters including upper and lower cases. Use a different password for each of your website logins. If a hacker gets your password they will try it to access other sites,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nSplashData's estimates also said that almost 10% of people have used at least one of the 25 worst passwords on this year’s list:\n\n1 - 123456 (rank unchanged since 2016 list) \n\n2 - ",

We test it on two teppanyaki chefs performing culinary acrobatics.\n\nMANILA, Philippines – On Tuesday, October 19, Sony previewed their flagship phone, the Xperia XZ, a 5.2-incher with the top-flight specs expected in the segment and a P38,000 price tag. It's available now for pre-orders and will arrive in stores on November 18, 2016.\n\nThe XZ arrives at a good time. The race for smartphone supremacy is fairly open this time of the year. The top brands are facing issues and some criticism. Google's Pixel phone is seeking to shake things up but a local release hasn't been announced. Younger brands are continuing to feed the market with budget-friendly offerings. Especially with Christmas around the corner, the good-looking XZ is in a position to steal some of the attention from consumers looking for a new top-tier handset.\n\nWhat might make you strongly consider the phone? Its proposal to be the best phone at capturing action shots. Nowadays, it's expected for premium phones to feature stunning resolutions and rich colors. The XZ, based on our short time with it so far, fairly has that down pat. The photos look good. But what's not always expected is this: the feature set to capture moving subjects. Typically, you'd want to bring out a proper DSLR if, say, you want to take photos of children, pets or sporting activities.\n\nThe XZ presents itself as a device that can be relied on for such instances. It's been given a slew of focusing and stabilization technologies and manual settings to accommodate action shots.\n\nTo prove their point, Sony had media sit down in front of two teppanyaki chefs.\n\nHave you ever been at a teppanyaki restaurant where a chef does culinary acrobatics in front of you? If you have, have you ever said to yourself, \"Man, I wish my phone could capture all that onion-chopping action\"? No? That's all right. We've never thought of it too.\n\nSony did though.

They don't focus on what could go wrong; instead, they look forward to the payoff when everything goes according to plan.\n\nThis characteristic is seen in Sun Life’s short film “Waves,” which tells the story of Marco and Amanda, a millennial couple trying to make it work long-distance.\n\nAs with every relationship, they encounter waves of ups and downs.\n\nBut when Marco passes away, it seems as if any future they could have had together died along with him.\n\nBut what Amanda doesn't know is that Marco had planned ahead. He named her the beneficiary of his personal accident insurance – which reveals how eager he had been to pursue a future with Amanda.\n\n“Marco was smart. He was really forward-thinking,” brand ambassador Matteo Guidicelli observes in a reaction video he made with some friends.\n\nThe unpredictability of life was also brought up.

Here’s how\n\nMANILA, Philippines – The older we get, the bigger our spending power is.\n\nBut having a bigger paycheck doesn’t mean you can go all out and buy everything you want. It’s the time when you should be more conscious of the purchases you make, particularly for major ones like a wedding, home renovation, your kids’ education – or else, you put yourself at risk of financial trouble.\n\nAdults are expected to make better, smarter purchase decisions but sometimes, even they fall into the trap of making missteps that hurt their finances.\n\nAvoid making expensive mistakes that could keep you up countless nights by following these tips.\n\nWhen it comes to big purchases, doing it impulsively and for shallow reasons obviously don’t cut it. Don’t be swayed by distractions like popularity of a brand, by the belief that the more expensive an item is, the better; or by thinking that someone else might get it before you can, among others.\n\nSleep on it. It’s an age-old piece of advice but it’s something people still tend to forget upon seeing something they really like. Give yourself 24 hours at the very least and use that time to compare prices and terms of payment, check reviews, consult with experts or at least someone you trust, and think for yourself before making a decision.\n\nLearn to differentiate needs and wants\n\nNeeds and wants aren’t the same – learn to tell the difference when you’re buying things. For example, you’re about to get a suitcase because you travel a lot. You might want and can afford a gorgeous one from a luxury brand, but there might be a just-as-sturdy one that could be worth half the price.\n\nOr maybe you want a laptop but don't need it at the moment because your existing desktop at home is working perfectly fine, you also have your own PC at work and you can access almost everything with your smartphone. When you buy a laptop and not utilize it as much, your investment will just sit idly, unused.\n\nThe ",

If you own an older car or motorcycle, you might know of it.\n\nPertua’s function is simple: it extends oil and engine life by reducing friction between metals.\n\nBut if you read all the testimonials on their website and Facebook page, you’d think that people were talking about a miracle substance.\n\nEveryone who has used Pertua seems to say the same thing: it gave their vehicle instant power, and it helps them save fuel.\n\nWhat’s the story behind this unassuming product that has gained such a cult following?\n\nPertua was invented in 1986 by a Filipino mechanical engineer named John Simon.\n\nSimon has always been passionate about metals and machines – even before he graduated college, he was already working as an apprentice at a welding shop.\n\nAfter becoming an engineer, he moved to the US, where he worked as a lubricants researcher at a global oil company.\n\nHis task was to figure out how to improve the company’s fuel additives. But, when the fuel runs out, the additive’s benefits are gone too. So he wondered – what if he came up with an additive that could stay longer within the engine? It be more effective and cost-friendly.\n\nHe called his invention Tribotec – inspired by tribology, the study of friction and lubrication. In the Philippines, he launched it as Per’tua – short for perpetual, which is the ideal lifespan of an engine using the product.\n\nStories of the product’s wonders were legion. A car, drained completely of oil, was still able to run from Long Beach to San Francisco smoothly. A truck with a busted, leaky oil pipe made it back to its garahe without a single damage to the engine. Even the US military, according to Mr. Simon, w",

This is applicable not only when it comes to sharing content, but also when dealing with other people online.\n\nIn a world inundated by both real and fake news and other sensational content, Gonzalez suggests people actively combat the fake news phenomenon by thoroughly reading articles and checking their sources.\n\nIf you spot something that you think is fake, don't hesitate to report it, she added.\n\nGonzalez also said social media users should be mindful to provide constructive opinions, rather than letting their emotions get the better of them and bash others.\n\nSecond, Gonzalez advocates sharing insightful stories, or stories that are not only true, but can also inspire or otherwise provoke meaningful thinking.\n\nBy focusing on providing an avenue for insight, you offer value in your posts online.\n\nThird, she says people shouldn't post just because they know it will get likes.\n\nIn the grander scheme of things, Gonzalez reminds the audience they shouldn't be obsessed with virtual likes. Instead, by posting a mix of things in your life – those that you're excited about – you can engage people in an authentic way and in a manner that doesn't focus on people liking your posts.\n\nHer fourth piece of advice is to keep one's feelings in check. By this, Gonzalez wants users to be in touch with their feelings, and to realize that constantly comparing one's life to others online will not be productive.\n\nInstead, she pointed out, social media users can step back if the stress of being online is a bit",

Some political observers draw comparison of the impending sale to what happened with The Manila Times during the administration of President Joseph Estrada in 1999.\n\nDoes the comparison have basis?\n\nYes, if we look at both newspapers being critical of the sitting president, and ending up being sold to businessmen close to the chief executives. No, if we consider that The Manila Times was abruptly forced to sell for a song, while the Inquirer willingly negotiates with the buyer for sometime for a hefty price.

The activity was intended to show sympathy for victims of the administration's bloody war on drugs.\n\nThe Ateneo gathering was just one of the many pocket rallies triggered by the death of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in a police operation in Caloocan City. He is among the 81 killed in the latest wave of \"one-time, big-time\" anti-drug operations in Metro Manila and surrounding areas.\n\nIn a Facebook post, The Guidon, Ateneo’s official news publication, said that two policemen reportedly asked for the names of the leaders of the gathering – an old tactic used by policemen to intimidate protesters, according to netizens.\n\nThe post said that organizers advised the attendees \"to enter school premises, and disperse safely.\"\n\nThe Guidon also said the police car that parked along Gate 2.5 of the university did not have a license plate.\n\nThe photo, posted at 10 pm on Thursday, August 24, went viral overnight. As of posting, it elicited at least 3,000 reactions and was shared at least 2,700 times.\n\nHere are some reactions from netizens:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to The Guidon, around 40 to 50 people attended the rally, including faculty members, and high school and undergraduate students.\n\nThe rally was held on the same day that a Senate panel probed the killing of Delos Santos.

He was associated with the camp of another anti-Marcos icon, Nenita “Inday Nita” Cortes-Daluz and even had a radio program with her.\n\nMany Cebuano leaders were catapulted to national prominence because of the anti-Marcos struggle, most of them ending up getting elective positions at the local and national levels. If I remember it right, Wagas was among the young ones, becoming OIC mayor of Compostela in 1986 at the age of 23. He went on to win the mayoral joust in the 1988 polls.\n\nWagas traced his roots to Gervasio Wagas Sr., who was Compostela mayor during the World War II years from 1941 to 1943. No wonder he was able to jumpstart his political career at an early age. But he couldn’t sustain his hold on the town’s politics. Instead of running for reelection, he challenged and lost to the formidable Ramon “Nito” Durano III for the 5th district congressional post in 1992.\n\nOne can say that Wagas’s decision to leave Compostela town to his allies proved to be his political undoing. Not only was he a Don Quixote tilting at the windmills against Ramonito, who also successfully parried the same challenge by the then popular and administration-backed Inday Nita four years earlier, his mayoral bet also succumbed to the juggernaut that was Antonio Dangoy.\n\nThe Wagas clan would continue battling it out in election after election both in Compostela and in the district, but except for his brother’s win in the 2007 elections (he lost in 2010), the Wagas clan had obviously become a spent force, especially Gilbert.

Others speculated about how many men one particular former Miss America had had sex with. That same former title holder, Mallory Hagan, also was ridiculed over a bathing suit photo in which she appeared to have gained weight from when she competed in and won the pageant.\n\nThe emails have cost the pageant its television production partner, and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year.\n\nDick Clark Productions told The Associated Press Thursday night that it was made aware of the emails several months ago.\n\n“We were appalled by their unacceptable content and insisted, in the strongest possible terms, that the Miss America Organization board of directors conduct a comprehensive investigation and take appropriate action to address the situation,” the company said in a statement. “Shortly thereafter, we resigned our board positions and notified MAO that we were terminating our relationship with them.”\n\nIn its own statement Thursday night, the Miss America Organization said that Haskell, who earns $500,000 a year as CEO, had apologized to the board for his comments.

Similarly, we are negotiating with the local government of Mexico on how we could realistically solve traffic along our boundaries,” he added.\n\nMaintaining and regularly clearing San Fernando River, he added, will also be beneficial to other local governments in the fourth district of Pampanga.\n\n“The San Fernando River connects us to Sto. Tomas, Minalin and secondarily to Macabebe, San Simon, Apalit and Masantol. Regular clearing of San Fernando River will prevent flooding in these towns. So hindi lang San Fernando pero iniisip din natin ang mga kapitbahay nating mga bayan,” he said.\n\nSecond, Santiago stressed the need to boost tourism in the city as more investors are coming in.\n\n“We will have to work on a kind of tourism that is really vibrant at hindi iyung overnight lang. With more investors coming in, we need to boost tourism, eco-tourism at that, which will not harm the environment and will spur economic activity.

The nightly “daigon” (carolers) and the “Christmas carols” attracted the people to gather at the plaza until the “simbang gabi.” The heritage lives on,” Pacete said in his  Bacolod column.\n\nHe added that the different mayors of Silay then continued to improve the plaza lights and eventually converted the whole area into a Christmas Village.\n\nSince 2016, Mayor Mark Golez has spearheaded the activities with the various sectors.\n\nGolez said the annual Christmas Village in Silay City has become a Silaynon pride.\n\nEvery year, the lights-on ceremony is a most awaited event for Silaynons and the plaza then becomes a sight to behold, he added.\n\n“Over the years, this has become a Silaynon tradition which I plan to continue,” Golez said, adding that the Christmas Village has helped develop the Silaynon skill, artistry, teamwork, and creativity among the barangays and the public schools.\n\n“Everybody wants to win hence solidarity and teamwork prevails.

It also raised exemption for 13th month pay and other bonuses to P90,000.\n\nTo offset lost money to exemptions in personal income tax, the government is relying on the expansion of the value-added tax base and additional taxes on petroleum products, vehicles and sugar-sweetened beverages, among others.\n\nVersoza views this tax measure for the wage earner to be beneficial due to the lowering of withholding taxes.\n\n\"I think it’s something like one to two centavos increase for the first year which means if the consumer consumes 100 kilowatt per hour which is about 10 centavos plus one to two centavos,\" Versoza pointed out.\n\nThe residential consumers of Beneco contribute about half of the sales of the power distributor which have varying volume of consumption every month with those consuming 45 kilowatt hours and below a month constitutes about 70 percent.\n\n \"Consumers of Beneco who consume 45 kilowatt hours and below enjoys a discount, the so called lifeline rate. For instance, if your consumption is 20 kilowatt hours a month, and assuming the price command of Beneco is at P8, then you will have to pay around P160 resulting to a 50 percent discount or around P80,\" Versoza",

Search “holiday makeup look” on YouTube for inspiration, though, and find that pretty much everyone goes for a red lip this time of year. While that’s a timeless look, here are some ideas to try if you want to go for something a little more unique. Inspiration is everywhere!\n\nRed and green are on wreaths, poinsettias, and just about anywhere you’ll look this time of year. If red lips aren’t your thing, why not try green on the eyes? I hardly see people wearing green eyeshadow, but I think a deeper emerald green or forest green is super wearable when blended with trusty neutrals. If you’re not ready to go full-on green-eyed, a smudge of dark green eyeliner will have people looking twice (in a good way), trying to figure out what you’ve done differently to enhance your eyes.\n\nIt’s Christmas time in the city, and most ladies are sporting red manicures. Take inspiration from snow and frost (which would be nice in this heatwave) with a white and silver mani. How nicely would that pop while your hands are unwrapping red holiday ribbons?\n\nWhat goes with frankincense and myrrh, and with all your holiday outfits, too? A simple gold headband will look pretty to enhance any hair color or style, whether hair is up or down, or whether you’re heading out for day or night.",

Her latest project behind the camera is also about a single mom — but this time one who is raising a daughter.\n\nFor an episode of the Netflix series “Black Mirror,” Foster had to dig deep into mother-daughter dynamics to tell the story of a mom so anxious about her girl that she turns to a sophisticated surveillance tool.\n\nFoster is a mother of two boys — and her debut as a director was “Little Man Tate” in 1991 — so she reached back to how she interacted with her own mom and the push and pull that involved. It’s different with boys, she said.\n\n“When you’re raising a man, you’re just so in awe at how different they are,” she said. “It’s just so amazing to you how different they are in every way — not just the physical ways but how they think. It’s very easy to understand that they are separate from you. It’s not so easy, I think, with female children.”\n\nThe “Black Mirror” episode, titled “ArkAngel,” is part of season four of writer Charlie Brooker’s anthology series that taps into our collective unease with the modern world. Foster’s episode stars Rosemarie DeWitt, whose credits include “La La Land” and “Mad Men.”\n\nDeWitt, who has two young daughters, plays the mom wrestling with the implications of eavesdropping on her daughter as she grows into a woman. The actress laughs about a “gentle tension” on the set.\n\n“I sometimes felt Jodie was really rooting for the daughter and I was really rooting for myself. So we had this coustible thing,” said DeWitt. “It’s a really sticky relationship — mothers and daughters.”\n\nBrooker’s script intrigued both women with its ethical quandaries and rich characters. Foster likens the series to “The Twilight Zone,” serving up twists and messy human reactions to technology.\n\n“In some ways, the technology has outpaced our ethics and the ability for us to understand the monster that we’ve created,” she said. “Technology is kind of like ",

Pacquiao won a unanimous decision (118-110, 116-112, 116-112), ending Bradley's perfect win record.\n\nOn Saturday night, Pacquiao dropped Bradley in the seventh, appearing to be a push-down. But referee Tony Weeks called it a knockdown.\n\nIn Round 9, Pacquiao landed a huge left hand that dropped Bradley, who did a somersault.\n\n\"I was looking for a knockout in every round,\" said Pacquiao. \"He's a very tough fighter and a very good counterpuncher.\"\n\nBradley, 32, ",

The chance to recover their huge production cost is too small,” he said\n\nNegros Occidental is considered the Philippines’ sugar bowl, producing about 60 percent of the country’s sugar output, but in recent years the industry has faced challenges like lack of labor, the competition brought by the high fructose corn syrup, low prices of sugar, reduction in demand of sweeteners, among others.\n\nThe governor said that with HVCs, “the cost of production is low but the income is high.”\n\nAmong the crops, the governor cited to have potential markets include ginger, banana, jackfruit, cacao, coffee, and various root crops like sweet potato and yam.\n\nHe said the country is currently importing most of these HVCs, like yam and jackfruit, from Thailand.\n\n“There is a shortage in supply of ginger. The consumption of chocolate is also increasing thus, farmers growing these products are assured of an available market,” Marañon said.\n\nThe provincial government had earlier sent an agriculturist to Davao to train on coffee and cacao production, who will now teach farmers in the upland areas of the province.\n\nThe governor also expressed optimism that with right technologies, the province will be able to produce more HVC through the organic farming system to further increase the profitability of local farmers.\n\n“Let us help each other,” Marañon said, as he assured farmers of the province’s support through the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist.\n\nDuring the a",

The surety bidder’s bond is one of the eligibility requirements for the bidding process and is set at 5% of the approved budget for the project. The budget set by the MMDA for the project was P4.989,079.60, the 5% of which is equivalent to P249,453.98. Unfortunately for Armal, its surety bidder’s bond was only P249,453.95, resulting in its disqualification.\n\nAccording to Trinidad, disqualifying a bidder which is short only of three-centavo surety bond shows that “MMDA is transparent and strictly compliant to the criteria imposed under the procurement law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.”\n\n“The MMDA is guided by the basic principles of government procurement: transparency, competitiveness, good governance and accountability. As they say, the law may be harsh but it is the law,” Trinidad added.\n\nThe two other bidders, were PJ Construction & Supply and Tuchar Construction, Inc. The winner was PJ Construction with a bid price of P4,746,941.27 against Tuchar’s P4,804,072.44.\n\nThe BAC said that Armal has the right to file a motion for reconsideration provided that it has sufficient basis.\n\nThe drainage improvement project is set to be implemented along Apo Street and its vicinity in District 1, Quezon City by 2018.",

I had written several short stories that dealt with the same major character who was growing up in a chaotic, colorful dictatorship reminiscent of the one foisted upon us by Ferdinand Marcos Sr. So what I did was gather together these disparate stories, link them up in one narrative, and continued writing more chapters until I had finished 300 pages of my first novel.\n\nI submitted the manuscript to Anvil Publishing, whose anonymous reader asked two questions: why was there a fairy tale in the middle of the story? (2)  why was the novel open-ended? I answered that my work was a postmodern novel and, therefore, it dealt with several forms of fiction layered together to form a pastiche.

This represents a more than 200 percent increase from its initial funding of P100 million,” Davao City Rep.

He said that although no storm was affecting the area, the northeast monsoon was prevailing on the eastern seaboard which could have led to the sinking.\n\n\"[W]e are not discounting the possibility that the weather may have been a factor in the incident although there are no storms or prohibition from sailing.

Given the significant reduction in the personal income tax, the employees of these firms should follow the regular tax rates applicable to other taxpayers,” Duterte said in his message.\n\nDuterte also rejected the provision providing zero-rating on the sales of goods and services of separate customs territories and tourism enterprise zones as they go against the principle of limiting the value-added tax (VAT) zero rating to direct exporters.\n\n“The proliferation of separate customs territories, which include buildings, creates significant leakages in our tax system. This makes the tax system highly inequitable and significantly reduces the revenues that could be better used for the poor,” Duterte added.\n\nTourism enterprises, meanwhile, are only allowed duty- and tax-free importation of capital equipment, transportation and other goods under the Tourism Act.\n\nThe third item vetoed by the President is the provision exempting self-employed and professionals with total annual gross sales and/or gros",

It takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the fresh law, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAccording to the DOF, the first tax reform package was “designated to shift the tax burden from the lower 99 percent of the community to the wealthiest 1 percent.”\n\nIt would also end the country’s complex tax system that has become vulnerable to evasion and leakages by transforming it into a “simple, just and efficient” structure, the DOF added.\n\nBut before this major victory of the Duterte government, the bill, according to the president himself, had met “rough sailing” before it reached his desk. Despite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s tax reform program had encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nSome sectors also warned that imposing higher excise taxes on cars, coal, fuel, mining, among others, could hurt the robust growth of certain industries.\n\nIn that regard, is the TRAIN law really a boon or a bane for both rich and poor Filipinos?\n\nIn an opinion piece published on BusinessWorld on December 19, Raymond Abrea,",

Cruz, Makati City; Meat Slut in Lilac St., Marikina; and Soma Café at the Medical City.\n\nHere’s the next six:\n\nFrom Hawaii, Michael Alegre brought the Poke craze to Manila with his Poke Shack.  Pokes are marinated fish that were a staple for fishermen of old in Hawaii. This small restaurant that incorporates Japanese and Korean cuisine offers Salmon Sriracha, Santorini Shawarma and California Tuna Rolls among their many selections. For those who do not favor raw food, they do have chicken with sweet bon chon sauce and salads in flavorful bowls.  Their hefty bowls cost between P190-250 and their half-bowls, which are very popular with office workers (they are called Poquito Bowls), cost P110 – P150. Poke Shack is in Libis, Quezon City where Michael says there is ample parking.  The restaurant itself is quite small and gets full for lunch, so they recommend take-outs for those who can’t get a table.\n\nFrom Libis, hie off to busy Katipunan where, tucked away in lush greenery and tall bamboo is an oasis called Ninyo Fusion, an ancestral house converted into a charming restaurant. On one side is a wire fence full of padlocks telling of stories of satisfied customers who dined here. Chef Ninyo Laus and his wife Cassie work as a team to run the place successfully.\n\nChef Ninyo’s specialty is French and Japanese cuisine and his creations are beautifully plated before they leave the kitchen.

She said the Philippines has more than 7,000 islands with at least 28 ethnic groups and these diversities have resulted in fundamental differences that hampered peace and development.\n\n“Perhaps, it is high time we give federalism a chance to manage these differences to achieve unity in diversity,” she added.",

It may be scattered or widespread,” Quiblat told The FREEMAN by phone last night.\n\nAs of yesterday morning, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 was hoisted over southern Cebu (covering Talisay City to Santander town), as well as other areas in the Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nWhen a Signal No. 1 is raised, winds of 30-60 kilometers per hour with intermittent rains can be expected within at least 36 hours. In this case, plants and different crops might be uprooted and suffer significant damages and houses made of light materials may be partially unroofed.\n\nAs this report was written yesterday evening, Vinta had not yet reached landmass. In the 5 p.m. bulletin of PAGASA, Vinta was spotted 200 kilometers east of Surigao del Sur, where it is expected to make its first landfall.\n\nQuiblat said Vinta has maintained its direction moving westward and is predicted to cross areas in Mindanao. With this observation, there is lesser chance that Vinta would change direction to west-northwest and make a landfall in southern Cebu.\n\nQuiblat said there is also a slim chance that Vinta will further intensify and reach third category or “severe tropical storm.” In fact, it may weaken due to land interaction.\n\nHe said Vinta may even downgrade to first category “tropical depression” or maintain its strength as tropical storm (second category).\n\nDennis Atto, train",

It is even glaring for the export industry,” Philippine Exporters Confederation Inc.

She competed against Team Adam Levine’s Addison Agen, the 16-year-old pop artist from Fort Wayne, Indiana who placed second.\n\nOriginally an artist of Miley Cyrus from the Blind Auditions, Chloe lost to Ashland Craft in the Knockout Rounds. Chloe performed Fleetwood Mac’s Landslide, while 21-year-old Ashland, a country singer from South Carolina, won the round with Bon Jovi’s Wanted: Dead or Alive.\n\nHowever, coach Blake apparently saw the huge potential from Chloe not to get eliminated and strongly make it to the competition. By virtue of a “Steal,” which Blake fought out with coach Jennifer Hudson, Chloe joined the stable of artists in Team Blake. The latter had another artist in the final four, country crooner Red Marlow, who ended up in fourth place.\n\nThat made Blake the coach with the most wins — six — in The Voice 13-season history. He really nailed it this year, not only as judge of the show. He was also voted as the Sexiest Man Alive for 2017 by People Magazine. Although that clearly gave him an edge over fellow coach and his perennial bratty mocker, Adam Levine (who earned the title earlier in 2013), Blake clearly stayed ahead of the course this time.\n\nTeam Miley’s Brooke Simpson, the 26-year-old pop-soul artist from Hollister, North Carolina, finished third. A four-chair-turner from the Blind Auditions in the pilot episode where she sang Demi Lovato’s Stone Cold, Brooke made it all the way to the finale, where she got to perform Wrecking Ball, with coach Miley.\n\nEvery artist in the final four had the chance to perform with a guest star in the finale.

There were noticeably fewer intense typhoons that passed through major rice production areas compared to previous years,” USDA said.\n\n“A substantial shift away from rice to corn is not expected due to delays in the tariffication of rice,” it added.\n\nThe lower importation is expected as production of milled-rice next year is seen increasing two percent to 11.97 million MT from 11.68 million MT.\n\nThe USDA expects rice fields to cover 4.8 million hectares, up two percent year on year.\n\nThis will be complemented by yield slightly improving to 3.95 MT per hectare.\n\nLocal corn production is seen to slightly improve by 1.2 percent to 8.2 million MT.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country’s import dependency ratio (IDR) abruptly decreased to 4.99 percent last year from 11.07 percent in 2015.\n\nRice imports fell 54.71 percent to $278.87 million in 2016. In terms of volume, shipments plunged by 58.87 percent to 609,360 MT.\n\nGiven lower imports, the country’s self-sufficiency ratio of rice increased to 95.01 percent from 88.93 percent in 2015.",

I can’t believe that I will win this event. I can’t even explain how happy I am right now,” said the 35-year-old champion who is a surf coach in Brazil.\n\n“Right at the end when I saw that wave come I knew it as the one and I knew I could do it. This has been a really amazing event for me. It is my first time here in the Philippines and the waves are so good, we have all been really spoiled with the waves we got and everyone was ripping so I feel really lucky to come out on top,” Monteiro added.\n\nMonteiro was off in the league in 2010 after he suffered knee injuries and took some time to focus on family and spent his time at home.\n\nHe said his last competition was sometime in 2010.\n\nThis year he has returned to competitive surfing arena and is determined to return to the elite level. This win not only gives him 3,000 raking points but the confidence to know he can still mix it with the best and win events – a feat he last accomplished at the prestigious Vans World Cup at Sunset Beach in 2010 in Hawaii, USA.\n\n“The last event I won was Sunset so it has been a while since I had this feeling,” Monteiro, who takes home the prize of $12,000, continued.\n\n“I have been workin",

Remollo issued the statement as he switched on the Christmas lights of a giant Christmas tree at the Quezon Park on Thursday evening.\n\nThe activity, witnessed by residents, was led by local officials, department heads, barangay captains and council members, including City Councilors Alan Gel Cordova, Michael Bandal and Lilani Ramon.\n\nChristmas is a time for family and friends. They come to the city to celebrate Christmas and it is annoying for them to hear heated arguments on air, Remollo said.\n\nThe mayor was hoping the coming year would be a very blessed year for Dumagueteños with many developments coming up, including economic, infrastructure and sports-development programs.\n\nMeanwhile, from 12,500 in the previous year, the number of indigent families who will receive “white gifts” this year doubled to 25,000. There would be an increase in the amount given to the beneficiaries from P300 to P400 per recipient, including persons with disabilities and senior citizens.\n\nThe mayor also announced there is a pending proposal to extend financial assistance to the elderly who will reach the age of 80 years. The proposal is to extend P10,000 every five years until they reach 100 years old.\n\nIn preparation for the massive infrastructure project, the city council approved an appropriation of more than P43 million for the purchase of heavy equipment so that all projects in the barangays will be fast-tracked.\n\nRemollo just signed a program of work worth P23 million for the repair of the damaged portion of dikes along the Banica River, including the spillways in Bagacay, Taclobo and Candau-ay.\n\nBut Remollo said this is only temporary as the long-term approach is to construct bridges in lieu of spillways.\n\nAs to the proposed location of the sanitary lan",

This is the reason we have not been able to meet procurement targets, resorting to importation to fill in the buffer stock requirement for food security,” NFA administrator Jason Aquino said in a statement.\n\n\n\n  The agency also believes  it will take a while before the domestic rice market would be able to adjust to the non-QR regime but noted government should continue to provide safety nets for  farmers who may be most affected by the liberal entry of imported rice into the country.\n\n\n\n  “We cannot speculate on how much lower rice prices could go under a non-QR but higher tariff situation. Our role in NFA is to ensure that there will always be enough affordable rice for everyone, including the small farmer-producers who are also end-consumers of their own produce,” Aquino said.\n\n\n\n He said  at present, small farmers  sell their own harvests and sometimes end up buying from the market for their own consumption.\n\n\n\n  NFA also claimed that while performing buffer stock functions, it shall continue to issue import licenses and provide necessary guidelines to ensure food safety and quality standards.\n\n\n\n  Earlier, the Department of Finance said lifting of QR on rice imports in favor of tariffs will bring several benefits to the economy, with the retail price of the food staple expected to be slashed by as much as",

If you cannot afford a decorator, your Christmas tree has no personality, no class, no Oh!s and Ah!s. Someone without a professional decorator encircled her tree with a silver Christmas barbed-wirey strands. “Auschwitzy” they called her tree.The Professional Tree Decorator studies the ambiance of the room, the magnetism of the family, the contents/worth of the home, and most important, the fee to charge.

Imported plastic pine tree was the thing to have then, coveted, but too expensive. Pines were still plentiful, cheap (before pine plantations were denuded).

This, from a man who agrees with another writer from Mindanao that labels are dangerous.\n\n“Labels kill,” says Mindanao writer Tyrone Velez. It renders you open to attacks, said human rights watchdogs. Since December 5, President Duterte has been labeling the government critics and dissenters as ‘legal fronts’ of groups which, in turn, he labeled also as “terror” groups.\n\nIt turns out Sherwin de Vera should know about the hazards of being labeled. Just a week after the Duterte administration formally tagged the revolutionaries as ‘terror’ groups, and certain legal mass organizations as ‘legal fronts,’ policemen seized de Vera on a bus bound for Candon on Tuesday, December 12. The police reportedly boarded the bus at a checkpoint and went straight for de Vera.\n\nKalikasan PNE said de Vera is detained as of presstime at Camp Elpidio Quirino, Bulag, Bantay, Ilocos Sur. He faces charges of rebellion.\n\nIn a statement condemning his arrest, the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment offered more appropriate labels to match de Vera’s daily life activities. These labels include the following:\n\n– coordinator of Defend Ilocos, a network of environmental advocates in the Ilocos region.\n\n – co-organizer of the People’s Summit against the environmentally destructive mining activities of Cordillera Exploration Co. Inc. (CEXCI) in Cervantes.\n\n – co-organizer of mobilizations against the proposed construction of dirty fuel-based coal-fired power plant in Luna, La Union.\n\n – participant in last October’s Lakbayan for justice and self-determination of the National Minorities in Metro Manila.\n\nDefend Ilocos, the network which de Vera coordinates, “played a key role in leading the Save the Abra River Movement (STARM), which rallied against the detrimenta",

It’s such a tremendous honor for our efforts to be recognized by the festival that is closest to the heart of the Catholic Church.”\n\nDy explained that St. Ignatius’ life story “doesn’t fit the mold of the typical saint narrative.” “It’s so heartening to see that our film’s message has connected with audiences and festivals all over the world, especially those that seek films about the struggle to find the light in an increasingly dark and conflict-ridden world.”\n\n“The film was made with blood, sweat and tears,” related producer Pauline Mangilog-Saltarin who shared the trophy with the entire team who had made the film “with so much passion and grace … [it’s] a genuine labor of love.”\n\nExecutive producer Fr. Emmanuel Alfonso pointed out: “It came as a real surprise because it was our first attempt at filmmaking. We hope that more people will be inspired by the example of St. Ignatius.”\n\n The Mirabile Dictu is considered the “Oscars of Catholic films” and aims “to give space to producers and filmmakers … [whose works] promote universal moral values and positive role models.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.",

Colamussi may have a bail hearing in the future. Villanueva, a citizen of the of the Philippines who lived in Glen Head, New York, had been ordered permanently detained at a previous court appearance.\n\nProsecutors and the two men’s attorneys are in early talks about potential plea deals.\n\nAn attorney for Villanueva said that more than a dozen former employees were willing to testify to Villanueva’s character and kindness as an employer.\n\nThe Thatched Cottage has been closed since 2014, when Huntington officials condemned the property on the waterfront along State Route 25A in Centerport. Colamussi owned the facility for 26 years before filing for bankruptcy protection in 2014.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Colamussi and Villanueva recruited potential employees in the Philippines between 2008 and 2013 with “false promises of jobs with overtime pay,” and then made them pay money back to them to qualify for visa interviews.\n\nProsecutors said they have “overwhelming evidence,” including a “wealth of documents” that were signed by Villanueva and Colamussi or used by them to get Philippine nationals to come to the United States and fraudulently obtain work visas. Prosecutors also said more than a dozen witnesses prepared to testify against the two.\n\nAccording to the indictment, employees worked for pay lower than promised, went without overtime compensation and were required to do chores outside the scope of their jobs, including caring for Colamussi’s relatives and r",

Broadening the VAT base will only worsen the burden on poor Filipinos,” Africa added.\n\nIn addition, only “economically-active” regions such as Metro Manila, Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon would get the “biggest chunks” of infrastructure projects prioritized under the tax reform package, according to Africa.\n\n“That the poorest regions like the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and Caraga Administrative Region (CAR) are getting only small portions of the Build Build Build projects indicates that the Duterte administration marginalizes poor Filipinos,” Africa said.",

Two batches of CPP leaders arrived and walked from the bus terminal to the house in Dulacac.\n\nThey had chosen the place because it was safe, secluded and far from Metro Manila, Sison said in an earlier e-mail message.\n\nDulacac, which is a 30-minute uphill drive from the City Hall here, lies near the boundaries of this city and the towns of Bani and Mabini.\n\nThe two-story house Sison was referring to was demolished by the lot’s new owners, Ballesteros said.\n\nOld folk in the village said they remembered the house as “a place often visited by strangers to the town.”\n\n“I don’t think the villagers knew then that those strangers were CPP members. Now we know,” Ballesteros said, adding that the event has made Barangay Dulacac part of history.\n\nFormer Mayor Hernani Braganza said he learned about the city’s historic ties to the CPP in 2001 when he served as agrarian reform secretary and as member of the government panel in peace talks with the CPP’s broader coalition, National Democratic Front of the Philippines.\n\nIt was Sison, Braganza said, who gave him the CPP back story at a meeting ",

Conceptualized by PSC Visayas commissioner Ramon Fernandez, the Visayas Open Tournament not only aims to strengthen grassroots talent but also provide exposure for potential athletes who can represent the country in the 2024 Olympics. The Cebuana Tabal is a women’s marathon gold medalist in the 2017 Southeast Asian Games and an Olympian while Diaz won a silver medal in the women’s 53-kg weight division of weightlifting in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Visayas Open aims to find more athletes who could follow the footsteps of Tabal and Diaz. It will have 15 Olympic sports: karatedo, boxing, taekwondo, judo, marathon, open water swimming, triathlon, archery, shooting, fencing, weightlifting, badminton, table tennis and tennis. It will also feature arnis, which is not an Olympic sport. Philippine Sports Institute (PSI) director Nonie Lopez said that the Visayas Open is for athletes aged 22 and below. Winners in each sport will be trained for free by the PSC until they are ready to compete in major competitions as members of the national team. The first part of the Visayas Open will be the Sinulog Fun Run, which will feature 10-kilometer, 5K and 3K distances. Winners here will automatically be champions for running and will be trained for free by John Philip Dueñas, the coach of Tabal. Cebu City will be hosting the first leg of the Visayas Open on April 8-9. The next legs will be on June 2 to 3 at the City of Naga, June 9 to 10 in Tagbilaran City, Aug. 11 to 12 in Iloilo City, Aug. 25 to 26 in Danao City, Oct. 27 to 29 in Boracay and Dec. 1 to 2 in Ormoc City.

Councilor Dave Tumulak, head of the City Council’s committee on public order and safety, said he met with Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Cebu City District Engineer Jose Gauran yesterday to prepare for possible emergencies. “We reminded them to ready their emergency response team. We asked them to put on standby their tree cutters and their heavy equipment,” Tumulak said. Although Vinta will not directly hit Cebu, weather forecasts show that it is expected to bring in strong winds and heavy rains. This is why it is important to start trimming big trees especially those located along roads and near power lines,Tumulak said. The DPWH assured that their emergency response team will be activated by Friday morning and that they will be in constant coordination with the city government. Aside from trees, outdoor billboards also pose a hazard during storms. Tumulak said he also talked with Jeremy Huang, president of Cebu outdoor advertising agencies and asked them to roll down their billboards. “They have started rolling down their billboards this (yesterday) afternoon,” he said. He added that he also talked with Cebu Contractors Association president Pete Dakay to caution managers and workers in all ongoing construction sites in the city to be on alert as Vinta moves near the Visayas. At the same time, Tumulak asked Dakay to inform all their member contractors with ongoing construction projects to keep their cranes on freewheel. This way, the crane will just rotate if it is blown by strong winds. If it is grounded, the crane could collapse or topple down when hit with strong winds.

How much more for [a] handmade card with a touch of dedication, passion, and art,” Bowman said in an e-mail interview with .net.\n\nShe makes customized handmade cards for all occasions and sells it on her Facebook page.\n\nAlbeit a rare custom these days especially among people her age, Bowman said giving out greeting cards is an effective way of making someone “feel important and valuable” because of the sender’s message written inside it.\n\nWhile it is not as popular in the Philippines as with the United States, card-giving remains a practice among some Filipinos, especially among the older generation, who prefers to add a personal touch to their gifts or simply tell someone they care.\n\nBut admittedly, the practice of card-giving among Filipinos has waned with the rise of the Internet.\n\nMalou Posadas, Assistant Vice President for Product Management of Filstar Distributors Corp., the exclusive licensee of Hallmark Philippines, said the technology has definitely made a huge impact to the company as people now can easily greet everyone through social media – a medium that is convenient and free.\n\n“There’s a decline [in sales].

He’s going to be a very good addition to our team,” remarked coach Norman Black.\n\nBaser Amer added 17 markers, 12 dimes, and five boards, Jared Dillinger got 15 points, 11 rebounds, and two assists, and Chris Newsome had 15 markers in the win.\n\nMeralco took hold of the game in the third quarter as Cañaleta caught fire and ignited 19-0 blast to turn a close 50-54 deficit to a 69-54 advantage with 4:01 to play.\n\nThe Bolts seemingly were well on their way to an easy victory, taking a 90-71 lead with 8:19 left, but Blackwater made a late 24-8 run to trim the lead down to three, 98-95 with 33.1 seconds left before Cañaleta put the Elite to sleep late.\n\n“I thought we did a good job of recovering from a slow start today, especially in the first half. We did recover a little bit late in the second quarter and it carried over into the second half where we got off to a good start. But the energy that we spent trying to get that big lead really cost us down the stretch because we gave that lead up just as quickly as we got it.

With implementation of the TRAIN, which exempts workers with an annual income of P250,000 and below from personal income tax payment, expected to start next year, National Economic Development Authority (Neda-7) regional director Efren Carreon says people will have more money to spend. “This increase in spending capacity of the working class will be enhanced with the implementation of the tax reform law. There will be an increased demand for consumers goods and services. It will be good for the retail industry,” Carreon said in a roundtable discussion with reporters yesterday. He added that some retailers in the region have already started to expand not only within the urban areas but also to the countryside. This is expected to be propelled by the increased consumer spending with the passage of the TRAIN law. The TRAIN bill was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte last Tuesday. It is the first package of the government’s proposed Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) which is seen to generate additional revenue to fund the country’s investment requirements. But in order to make up for the loss in revenue from income tax, the TRAIN law imposes higher taxes on some products like cars, fuel, tobacco, cosmetic surgery and some sweetened beverages. However, this is still not a concern, according to Carreon. “Not all the goods (prices) will increase. Mostly, those that will have higher taxes are fuel, cars, only those who can afford will be affected,” Carreon said. Employment rate Based on records from the Neda-7, Central Visayas recorded a 95 percent employment rate for the first semester of 2017. Carreon said this is higher than the national average of 93.8 percent. Although these records are only for the first six months of the year as the Neda-7 is yet to finalize its data for the second semester, Carreon explained that this positi",

Add to that, surging nationalism and populism particularly in Europe, an increasingly belligerent North Korea, and a Russia trying to create a bigger role for itself in the global stage, and you get a chaotic 12 months.\n\nHere are some of the biggest stories around the world in 2017.\n\nLate-night tweetstorms. 180-degree policy reversals. \"America First.\" Welcome to the first year of the Donald Trump presidency.\n\nThe entry of the 45th US president into the scene as the so-called leader of the free world has had an oversized impact on both inside and outside the borders of the United States.\n\nOn his inauguration day, Trump vowed to follow a policy based on \"America first.\" Through early morning tweets, he unraveled the achievements of his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama. He pulled out of several international agreements: on climate, free trade, immigration, and Unesco.\n\nSuspicions of collusion between his election campaign and Russia, however, dogged the start of his term.\n\nOn December 6, in another break with his predecessors, Trump created shockwaves around the world when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nNorth Korea's sprint toward full-fledged nuclear statehood accelerated sharply in 2017. An increasingly-belligerent Pyongyang – and volatile US rhetoric – dominated the world agenda and looks set to do the same next year as the international community struggles to contain the North's nuclear and missile ambitions.\n\nOn September 3, North Korea, conducted its sixth and largest nuc",

That was until the Marck Espejo-led team denied the National University (NU) Bulldogs their 3rd straight title and started a streak of their own.\n\nSince then, head coach Oliver Almadro has continued to fortify his arsenal in order to achieve his players' champion form.

Ateneo setter Ish Polvorosa also claimed his 4th straight Best Setter award.\n\nIn Game 2 of the UAAP Season 80 Women's Basketball finals, the University of the East (UE) Lady Warriors threatened the National University Lady Bulldogs' reign atop the league, nearly ending their record of 63 straight victories.\n\nThe Lady Bulldogs still had enough magic to top the Lady Warriors in the fourth quarter, outscoring them 28-14 to clinch their 4th consecutive UAAP title and keep their undefeated record at its best of 64 wins and produce another perfect 16-0 season for the 4th straight time.\n\nJack Danielle Animam secured her first MVP title, keeping the award with NU for the 4th straight time after the graduation of 3-time MVP Afril Bernardino in Season 79.

You’re not alone.\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up over 90% of registered businesses in the Philippines today. With tech-savvy, purpose-driven millennials being dubbed by Forbes as the most entrepreneurial generation today, emerging business owners are often young, and they all dream of combining work with passion. (READ: What entrepreneurs can learn from the millennial attitude)\n\nThey all face the same big question: how does one create success as an entrepreneur?\n\nUnlike in traditional corporate settings, an entrepreneur's success is not set. In fact, even the very definition of success is subjective. Every entrepreneur will go through his or her own set of triumphs and failures, challenges, opportunities, and risks. How then can you overcome these obstacles and thrive?\n\nIt’s scary not having a formula, but with the right tools, each entrepreneur has the power to create success in his or her own terms.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 7, we hosted a roundtable discussion with a group of local business owners who shared their personal tales of passion, failure, and success.\n\nThis roundtable was hosted by fellow entrepreneur, RJ Ledesma.\n\nBe inspired to follow your own entrepreneurial dreams by tuning in on the discussion. – .com",

The accompanying survey was done from September to October, covering around 300 respondents from Southeast Asian cities.\n\nThe survey places Metro Manila 3rd worst in the region, with an average of 66 minutes stuck in traffic daily.

La Viña clarified that the tunnels were created to “bring water to the [mining pit],” and not to throw waste.\n\nHe said that it was a \"fundamental design mistake\" which can be attributed to lower spending. “Kasi problema palagi yung ayaw nilang gumastos (It’s always a problem that they don’t want to spend),” La Viña said.\n\nAs time passed by, the dam was being filled with mine tailings.

This initiative, often called “RevGov,” is intended to give Mr Duterte the power and authority to act swiftly and without impediment to address the problems brought about by crime, corruption, non-inclusive growth, and issues that stem from the 1987 Constitution.\n\nProponents of RevGov have argued that the Constitution is holding the President back from enacting what they claim to be the will of the people. Hence, by setting the Constitution aside through “revolution,” Mr. Duterte would finally be unfettered and free to carry out his vision.\n\nThe frustration is understandable. Despite widespread popularity and a position of patronage vis-à-vis his allies in government, Mr. Duterte has nevertheless found his ability to rapidly carry out a broad agenda stymied. The main reason for this is that, despite the vast power that he wields, the president of the Philippines is not an absolute ruler. The president cannot act without Congress, Congress cannot execute things on its own, and actions of either are subject to the review of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, the system of checks and balances forces leaders into a paradigm of constant deliberation and consensus-building, with any consensus subject to possible tests of constitutionality. Thus, there can be no rapid, sweeping changes, regardless of administration, because the system of government under the Constitution is not designed to work that way. The theory behind this is that slow, deliberate action, developed through cooperation, is preferable to any one man or small group of men calling the shots.\n\nWe’ve seen what happens when one-man rule occurs.

However, with great following comes great responsibility, and their missteps on social media spread quickly as their likes grew.\n\nGovernment agencies also had their fair share of viral slip-ups, from an accidental livestream to the publishing of article drafts.\n\nWe take a look back at some of this year's online blunders by government officials and agencies.\n\n1.

The Philippine News Agency (PNA) was not spared from using the wrong photos either as the site used a photo taken in Vietnam to accompany a story about the Marawi siege. Unlike Uson, the PNA acknowledged and apologized for its mistake.\n\n3. #FireMocha trended in August, after netizens pointed out a misleading tweet by the Assistant Secretary for social media. In her tweet, Uson called out Vice President Robredo and senators Bam Aquino, Sonny Trillanes, and Risa Hontiveros to visit the wake of a cop, as they did Kian delos Santos. However, the story that she linked to was published a year ago on the Inquirer.\n\n4. In October, Uson shared another photo from Marawi.

The village is no longer there,\" Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told Agence France-Presse by telephone.\n\n\"The houses were toppled by mud and logs and only the stumps of a few concrete homes are left,\" Parami said.\n\nPolice, soldiers and volunteers were digging through the rubble of Dalama, a farming village of about 2,000 people, using shovels in search of more bodies, he added.\n\nAt least 4 others were killed in nearby towns and cities, police said, while 7 people perished in Lanao del Sur province according to civil defence officials there.\n\nAt least 4 people were listed as missing after being buried in landslides or being swept away by floodwaters, while more than 12,000 have fled their homes.\n\nThe Philippines is pummelled by 20 major storms each year on average, many of them deadly. But Mindanao, home to 20 million people, is rarely hit by these cyclones.\n\nAfter slicing across Mindanao on Friday, December 22, Tembin sped west over the Sulu Sea with gusts of 95 kilometers an hour.\n\nIt was forecast to smash into the tip of the western island of Palawan late Saturday, the state weather service said.\n\nTembin struck less than a week after Tropical Storm Kai-Tak devastated the central Philippines, leaving 54 dead and 24 missing.\n\nThe deadliest typhoon to hit the country was Yolanda (Haiyan), which left 7,350 people dead and destroyed entire towns in heavily populated ",

A championship in the BLIA Cup in Taiwan last August where they faced teams from China, France and the United States was proof.\n\nBut things went downhill since then. A few weeks after winning the title in Taiwan, the Green Archers were at the headlines for the wrong reasons following a bench-clearing brawl against the Far Eastern University Tamaraws in a pre-season game in Davao.\n\nA few weeks passed again and they lost to the University of the Philippines Fighting Maroons, 87-98, midway the first round. To be fair, the Fighting Maroons were highly competitive heading into Season 80 but no one anticipated them to defeat the Green Archers, much more win by double digits.\n\nNow, people had speculations if La Salle was imploding. Then the speculations grew louder after reports surfaced that there was a rift between players and bosses from La Salle were unsatisfied with how head coach Aldin Ayo handled his wards.\n\n“We were not able to handle very well our championship last season. I don’t want to expound on that. Medyo maselan eh. We were not able to handle really well our championship. Worried ako how we started our season. Siyempre, being the head coach, I’m accountable for everything that happened,” said Ayo.\n\nFast forward to t",

As a cherry on top, the Heat slipped past the first-seeded Celtics, 90-89, Wednesday, December 20 (Thursday Manila time).\n\nAlready missing team stars Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic due to injuries, the Heat trooped to the Celtics home court TD Garden possibly hoping that at the very least, they don’t get embarrassed on live television by the team which had the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference last season.\n\nInstead, Olynyk carried his new team on his back with the same shooting touch that endeared him to the fans in Beantown. Inadvertently, it was probably Boston itself that fired up Olynyk so much.\n\nIn a hilarious twist, at 11:28 am, Manila time, a Wikipedia user changed Olynyk’s Wikipedia picture to a goat, signifying that he’s the “Greatest Of All Time.” (G.O.A.T.)\n\nPrior to the game, it was announced that the 2013 13th overall pick would be receiving the “Heroes Among Us” Award from the Celtics organization. According to the Celtics page in the NBA website, Olynyk was chosen for the award “in celebration of the incredible impact that he had on the local community as an active, off-court citizen.” Usually, the team gives this award during timeouts to ordinary citizens who have gone above and beyond in service to the city.\n\n“I love this community and just everything the Celtics did,” Olynyk said Wednesday afternoon following Heat shootaround. “It was just fun, you know; fun to get out there with the kids, especially. This community does a lot for this team.\n\n“When I first got here, [the Celtics] weren’t very good at all, but [the community] support",

[Where are we eating?]”\n\nWe ask this question everyday. Sometimes during breakfast, most of the time during lunch at work, and often during dinner dates with our friends or significant other.\n\nAsking more questions helps us decide: “Is this what I’m craving for? Does this restaurant have good reviews? Is the food any good? Is it affordable?”\n\nBut besides the taste or customer rating of a restaurant, there are more important questions we should be asking about the food that we’re putting inside our bodies.\n\nOn our first ever #WhatsNext farm-to-table cooking workshop last December 9, our friends from Holy Carabao Holistic Farms taught us how to cook and eat better by asking five simple questions about the food we consume.\n\nFor Hindy Weber and Melanie Teng-Go, our program leaders, and founders of Holy Carabao, these are also the foundations on how they approach their business. “A sustainable business considers not just the product but as well as the planet and the people,” said Hindy.\n\n“We should recognize what’s on our plate,” said Melanie.\n\nA tinola may sound like a simple, healthy enough dish. But do you know what kind of water was used to make the broth? Was the soup made with artificial flavorings? Where was the chicken sourced from?\n\nIt’s not enough that you’re satisfied with what you’re eating, you also have to make sure that you’re getting the right nourishment.\n\nHow was it prepared?\n\nEveryday people are busy with their jobs and taking care of their families. And the heavy traffic and packed trains during your commute leave you with no energy to cook your own meals. But it’s still best to keep dining out to a minimum.\n\n“Even if it’s not organic, if it’s cooked by your mom in the kitchen, it’s still healthier than what you buy commercially,” said Melanie.\n\nA healthy meal doesn’t have to be prepared us",

The decision was penned by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa.\n\nPADPAO asked the SC to declare as unconstitutional Section 2(e), Rule III of Comelec Resolution Number 10015, which set the rules and regulations for the gun ban during the 2016 national and local elections.\n\nSection 2(e) sets the documentary requirements for applications to secure an authority to bear, carry, or transport firearms or deadly weapons by members of private security service providers (PSSP) or private security agencies (PSA).\n\nPADPAO argued that the Comelec \"does not have any authority to promulgate\" such rules covering PSAs.\n\nIt added that Republic Act 5487 or the Private Security Agency Law already grants them the authority to possess, bear, carry, and transport firearms, thus there is no need for them to apply for gun ban permits through the Comelec.\n\nThey further claimed that the resolution \"violates the constitutional tenets of equal protection of laws and non-impairment of obligations of contracts as it impairs the contracts of its member PSAs with their respective clients.\"\n\nPADPAO also said that the Comelec contradicted itself in Section 1 of the same resolution, which says members of PSSPs may carry firearms.\n\nBut the SC ruled that the Comelec was within its rule-making authority to issue the questioned provision in Resolution Number 10015.

Banal certainly thinks so.\n\nIn an interview with ABS-CBN Sports, the current head coach of Marinerong Pilipino PBA D-League squad has thrown in his name for consideration. “I’ve submitted my application to them,” he said.\n\n“UE is on a 31-year title drought. I’ve done it with San Beda after a 28-year title drought,” said Banal, a former UAAP and NCAA champion head coach. “I know what to do and how to do it.”\n\nIf hired, Banal’s entry to UE gives not one, but two benefits to the struggling program. One, his championship mettle may be key to reviving UE’s championship pedigree. After all, UE is still tied with the University of Santo Tomas (UST) for the second-most UAAP men’s basketball championships at 18.\n\nTwo, as current Marinerong Pilipino head coach, Banal will get to spend time with prized UE star and Marinerong Pilipino’s 19th overall pick Alvin Pasaol, who has remained silent on whether he’ll return to the team after Derrick Pumaren resigned. Pasaol has formed a father-and-son-like bond with Pumaren, and Banal’s interaction with him will likely influence his decision to stay.\n\nBanal had led a young Arwind Santos to a title with Far Eastern University (FEU) in 2003 and received another in 2004 after De La Salle University (DLSU) was stripped of the honor due to a player eligibility scandal. He then led San Beda College in the NCAA to a title in his first full season in 2006, ending their drought. Even after his firing the very next year, San Beda completed a three-peat championship run from 2006-2008 and has since morphed into the title-collecting powerhouse it is today.\n\nHe has also tried his hand in professional basketball, serving as the chief tactician of the PBA’s Barako Bull Energy from 2014-2016 and the Phoenix Fuel Masters in",

Despite objection from their kids, they ended up living in separate houses, blaming their opposing personalities for the failed marriage.

Here the ‘ber’ months are typically used to refer to one of the longest holiday seasons in the world.\n\nAs early as September, Christmas songs start playing on radio stations and marketers launch holiday deals and promos, all with the intent of getting consumers in the mood to buy gifts, plan trips, and celebrate with their families and loved ones.\n\nBut are Filipinos’ shopping habits really aligned with these dates? And with growing concern about heavy traffic and poor public transportation in Metro Manila, how much shopping will be done online, and on which platforms? To find answers, Nerve, ’s data research arm, recently conducted a survey among our readers.\n\nRespondents were mostly millennials (aged 18-35) as well as adults aged 36 and up. The survey was served to visitors of the  site from September 12 to 18. Majority (70%) of respondents hailed from the Philippines. There were slightly more female respondents (54%) than men (46%).\n\nThe survey's margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points, with a 99% level of confidence.

Only 5% of respondents said they shop in either September or October.\n\nThis means that early marketing and in-store retailing efforts spent on Christmas may largely be wasted.

While a chicken egg takes about 21 days to hatch, BAVI took 15 years.\n\nChooks to Go: born from defense\n\nBAVI is one of the Philippines’ largest poultry integrators, and caters to the Bountry Fresh group of companies, which, in turn, operates a network of rotisseries under the brands Chooks To Go, Uling Roasters, and Reyal. BAVI is also in the business of producing commodity chicken products – supplying dressed chicken to supermarkets, wet markets, restaurants, hotels, and its company-owned retail stores nationwide.\n\nFounded in the 1980s by businessman Tennyson Chen, the company started operations in Sta Maria, Bulacan, with a layer farm of merely 5,000 chickens.\n\nIt was in 2002 when Chen wanted to take the company to its next level.\n\nSeeking to professionalize and scale up the business, Chen hired Ronald Mascariñas, then president of Smokey’s, San Miguel PureFood's fast-food brand selling a variety of hotdog products, and Senior Vice President of San Miguel PureFood’s Poultry and Food Service businesses.\n\nMascariñas built a team, most of them trusted colleagues from his previous roles, who then leveraged on th",

(READ: TIMELINE: Marcos-Robredo election case)\n\nThe PET had earlier ordered the Vice President to pay P15 million for the 31,278 established precincts she is contesting in her counter-protest.

In January 2017, she announced that the Philippines dropped 19 places in the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, and blamed it on the extrajudicial killings.\n\n\"Despite all of these positive things and even greater potential gains, we have to face the reality of the daily accounts of unsolved killings, many of them committed brazenly with public warnings against drug pushing or addiction,” Sereno said without directly mentioning Duterte.\n\nThe Chief Justice stepped it up in March, calling on lawyers during the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) convention to help address the “creeping impunity.”\n\n“In the face of clear and patent injustices, we have an affirmative duty to not turn a blind eye but to do what we can to help,” Sereno said.\n\nAnd when the President proclaimed martial law in Mindanao in May, Sereno stood up before graduates of the Ateneo de Manila University and warned that military rule could be used to oppress the people.\n\n“Suffice it to say that the martial law",

Breadwinners lost their jobs and livelihood, children were forced to stop schooling, and families that resided in the main battle area were left homeless.\n\nBut the city is slowly coming back to life. A few villages have been cleared for the safe return of residents.\n\nIn various conversations with the humanitarian workers of the UN Refugee Agency, many displaced families expressed optimism that they will recover from the devastation with the help of fellow Maranaos and other generous Filipinos.\n\nUNHCR calls on the public to continue standing in solidarity with the people of Marawi City, sharing with them the gift of hope.\n\n“Especially now that it’s Christmas - the season of giving - we would like to appeal to everyone to donate to UNHCR for the benefit of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) from here in Marawi and also for refugees around the world who might need help,” UNHCR advocate and broadcast journalist Atom Araullo.\n\nAraullo joined the UNHCR team in a recent visit to a com",

Senator Panfilo Lacson initially had more than P50 billion slashed from the DPWH budget, citing right-of-way issues. Legislators from both chambers opposed this.\n\nAccording to Senator Loren Legarda, chairperson of the Senate finance committee, the P50.7 billion was restored to the department. The DPWH, which is headed by former Las Piñas Representative Mark Villar, was given an additional P11 billion despite right-of-way issues.\n\nWhen the bicam report was taken up at the Senate on Tuesday, Lacson asked Legarda to provide a breakdown of the DPWH projects to be funded by the additional P11 billion. Legarda said these were not lump sum amounts and assured her fellow senator that she would provide the breakdown by next week.\n\n\"It will be submitted to him and will be broken [down] line by line. It's not a lump sum amount. Before the break, we will submit. For full transparency, it's a line by line breakdown, just so the body knows,\" said Legarda.\n\nThe bicameral conference committee also agreed to scrap the P500 million originally intended for the government's Masa Masid program, the anti-drug campaign of the Depart",

It narrates the story of a couple whose love for dance – and each other – diminished as they entered their twilight years.\n\nWhen the husband suffers from a stroke paralysis, his wife realizes she still loves him. Heartbroken, she wishes she’d danced with him when she had the chance.\n\n“You think you’re gonna be young forever. Then one day, you’re caught by surprise,” says actor Piolo Pascual in reaction to the film.\n\nJenny, one of his friends, agrees. “Everything in life is unexpected,” she says.\n\nWe never know what comes after the bend in the road, but the best we could do is prepare ourselves and loved ones for possible scenarios. One of the ways we do this is by ensuring we’re covered by life insurance.\n\n“Great motivator ‘yun e, ‘yung love mo for other people. [Love is a great motivator.] That’s what motivates you to do those things,” says Brian, Jenny’s partner.\n\nAnother simple way we can prepare for the unexpected is by making sure we're in good health.\n\nThis helps alleviate the possibility of being financially burdened with hospital bills. We shouldn’t wait until we're sick to start working on our health.\n\n“That’s the preparation there. Eating healthy, watching yourself, your health,” says Jay, a single dad.\n\nRichard, a Sun Life financial advisor, adds, “As responsible adults, that’s the best thing we could do. We have to prepare for our own future. Katulad niyan, ‘di ba nagkasakit?” [Like in the film, we get sick, too, right?]\n\nOne of Sun Life’s newest products is Sun Fit and Well, which ",

Manila also halted sale of the vaccine in the country and has ordered a probe into the matter.\n\nDuque said the number of children, ages 9 and above, inoculated with Dengvaxia has risen to about 830,000 from an initial estimate of nearly 734,000 after further verification by the Department of Health.\n\nThe state program, which was launched in 2016, cost 3.5 billion pesos and Duque earlier said the government has already paid 3 billion pesos to Sanofi. Sanofi’s Philippines office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sanofi officials said on Monday in Manila that there had been no reported deaths related to the vaccine. Duque, citing the drugmaker’s disclosure and studies, said Dengvaxia was meant to provide 30-month protection against dengue to those vaccinated, including those who did not have any prior dengue infection. But he said the case of a 12-year old girl in Tarlac province, north of the capital Manila, who completed the three-dose vaccine treatment and showed symptoms of severe dengue, seemed to have defied that. She was first inoculated with Dengvaxia in March 2016 and received the third and last dose in August this year, the health minister said.  Asked whether the case showed the effectiveness of th",

Kapag maayos at tahimik ang lugar, maraming investors lalo na mga foreigners ang magnenegosyo doon. Kaya ganito rin ang ginagawa namin dito sa San Simon,” she said.\n\nWong also noted that the empowerment of barangay tanods and other village officials serve as augmentation to the local fire and police force, which has shortage of manpower and personnel, and ensure the peace and order in town.",

Strong winds and large waves started to lash it about two hours into the trip, he said.\n\n\"The vessel came to a halt and started taking in water in the front side. The passengers dashed to one side and the ferry started to sink,\" Mendiola said.

And Aside from experience, you get to know other volleyball enthusiasts. You get to meet known players and coaches and it’s a bonus that you get to visit other places in the province as well,” said Sabas.\n\nWhen she played for the GUV Cup, Sabas already had extensive experience in volleyball, having played for the national girls team in her teens and carried her alma matter to several collegiate titles.

Last Sunday, October 29, the United Filipinos in Hong Kong (UNIFIL-MIGRANTE-HK) reported a historic celebration of Tribal Filipino Sunday. Migrant Filipinos working in Hong Kong turned a section of Edinburgh Place in the state’s busy Central district into a meeting place of overseas Filipino workers and indigenous peoples. They dubbed the event ‘a breakthrough’ of various overseas Filipino groups.\n\nMore than 700 from different groups of tribal Filipino migrants and advocates gathered at the Edinburgh Place and filled it with a festival of ethnic songs and pattong. They mingled with other migrants in their tribal gears and danced and chanted with them.\n\nThe historic event for migrant Filipinos and indigenous peoples was organized by Lumads from Mindanao through the Mindanao (HK) Workers Federation, Mangyans of Mindoro through Occidental Mindoro Association, and Igorots from the Cordillera region through the Mountain Province Federation, Benguet Federation, and Kalinga Province Hong Kong Workers Association.\n\nEach group of indigenous peoples who became overseas workers highlighted the issues prevailing in their homeland.\n\n \n\n During the gathering, they launched the “Defend Land, Life, and Resources” (DLLR) Coalition Hong Kong. The Abra Tinguian Ilocano Society (ATIS-HK), Cordillera Alliance (CORALL-HK) and United Filipinos in Hong Kong (UNIFIL-MIGRANTE-HK) combined forces to bring the coalition to life.\n\nDolo Balladares, chairperson of UNIFIL, told  there are many indigenous peoples from Cordillera, Mindanao and other places in the Philippines now working in Hong Kong.

The groups demanded full accountability from the Aquino government and the local government of North Cotabato.\n\nAfter the concelebrated mass at Quiapo church, the groups marched to Chino Roces bridge (former Mendiola) carrying banners that read, “Bigas hindi bala. Pagkain at hustisya para sa mga magsasaka (Rice not bullet. Food and justice for the peasants).”\n\nRenato Reyes, Jr., Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) secretary general slammed Aquino for remaining silent on the Kidapawan bloody dispersal.

This is a problem of the national government, because the Philippines – from north Luzon to Mindanao – is experiencing drought,” Reyes said.\n\nSuperstar Nora Aunor and theater actress Monique Wilson joined today’s protest action demanding justice for farmers who were violently dispersed by police forces last week.\n\nAunor said national leaders should resign. “Bumaba na sila dahil wala naman slang nagagawang kabutihan para sa mamamayan lalo na sa mga mahihirap na tao… Nagmasaker sila ng mga taong walang ibang kahilingan kundi bigas.” (They should step down because they are not doing anything good for the people, especially the poor…They massacred those who were only asking for rice.)\n\nWilson lambasted efforts by the government to muddle the issue.

It takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the fresh law, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAccording to the DOF, the first tax reform package was “designated to shift the tax burden from the lower 99 percent of the community to the wealthiest 1 percent.”\n\nIt would also end the country’s complex tax system that has become vulnerable to evasion and leakages by transforming it into a “simple, just and efficient” structure, the DOF added.\n\nBut before this major victory of the Duterte government, the bill, according to the president himself, had met “rough sailing” before it reached his desk. Despite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s tax reform program had encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nSome sectors also warned that imposing higher excise taxes on cars, coal, fuel, mining, among others, could hurt the robust growth of certain industries.\n\nIn that regard, is the TRAIN law really a boon or a bane for both rich and poor Filipinos?\n\nIn an opinion piece published on BusinessWorld on December 19, Raymond Abrea,",

Only when you have all these will you begin looking for capital and investors. And then everything falls into place albeit all the challenges you are sure to face.\n\nSo this 2018, let the year be the birth of your business. Here are six practical and inspirational tips that will get you going:\n\nThose who are passionate about things like cooking, arts and crafts, or traveling are the ones who aspire of earning from their passion.\n\nTurn your passion into a profitable enterprise by determining your unique selling proposition. Will you offer Filipino cuisine promoting healthy lifestyle? Will you produce tote bags made of hand-woven textile from local artisans? Will you bring travelers to off-the-beaten tracks?\n\nPossibilities are boundless, so narrow them down, keep the choices simple but desirable.\n\nBesides finding a unique selling proposition that is you, Forbes.com also suggests to “fill a hole in a certain market or niche.” Create a startup that will solve something that hasn’t been addressed yet instead of selling a product or offering a service that is already out there.\n\nThis way, it will be a lot easier to have a solid customer base.\n\nAccording to Tycoon.ph, a business — big or small — will need a back office composed of accounting, human resources, information technology and administration, to keep workflows running.\n\nDon’t be intimidated with this because it doesn’t necessarily mean hiring people to build a department. Two to five people are good enough in the beginning if you delegate tasks properly.\n\nBetter to get people who are willing to be your partners.

On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Japan, Australia, US and India reportedly met to discuss regional and global cooperation under the proposed concept of DSD.\n\nThe DSD is an entente of like-minded democratic countries. In the study, De Castro emphasized that Japan and Australia, which are both members of the DSD see the need to forge closer bilateral ties and links with third countries, especially other like-minded “middle powers” with shared values and interests. Further, it has likewise been observed that Australia and Japan have been proactive in seeking a convocation of like-minded states to offset a rising Chinese Power and declining US influence in the Asia Pacific. Indeed, like-minded countries have a significant role to play in preserving the security and status quo of the region. Other main claimants in the South China Sea like Vietna",

Edcel Lagman has criticized the administration for supposedly deleting the projects proposed by opposition lawmakers in next year’s P3.767 trillion budget.\n\nHe said the move was intended to punish and silence opposition legislators “even as it is their constituencies who are deprived of the benefits of infrastructure development.”\n\nPresidential spokesman Harry Roque said the executive branch had nothing to do with the removal of the budget of the projects of minority lawmakers.\n\n“There is separation of powers. Congress has exclusive and primary jurisdiction in the preparation and approval of the budget,” Roque said in a press briefing.\n\n“We had nothing to do with whatever decision both houses of Congress had on the alleged deprivation of projects as far as opposition congressmen are concerned. That’s something that should be addressed to the leadership of both houses of Congress,” he added.\n\nRoque said Malacañang could not do anything about the budget realignments because lawmakers are the ones who make decisions on the General Appropriations Act.\n\n“Since it’s not our business, we do not know if it’s true. Number two, even if it’s true, we can’t do anything about it because of the separation of powers. That’s something that Congress alone can decide,” the presidential spokesman said.\n\n“It’s not a decision that we make because all public funds must be supported by an expenditure law. So it’s not for us, a decision for the Executive to make, it’s a decision that Congress makes,” he added.\n\nDuterte signed the 2018 budget into law last Tuesday, an outlay that he said would help address poverty and promote economic growth.\n\nHe said next year’s budget, which is 12 percent higher than this year’s outlay, would primarily support infrastructure development, free ed",

Worse, we have seen how victims of these weather events suffer endlessly with the snail-paced rehabilitation efforts by our government, as shown by the Yolanda tragedy where the people affected are either given substandard homes or are still living in subhuman conditions four years after the infamous typhoon struck and despite the downpour of financial assistance.\n\nThe paper entitled: “Blameless in Stratosphere: Carbon Footprint, Manufacturing Growth, and the Fuel Mix Debate in the Philippines,” presented in a Stratbase-ADR Institute roundtable discussion, is able to put in context the Philippines’ contribution to climate change. Essentially, it highlighted that the Philippines has a very small carbon footprint with per capita carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions lower than African countries such as Angola, Congo and Djibouti. Notably, Dr. Raul Fabella, et al. looked at other Asian countries in their respective years of comparable development to 2011 Philippines.\n\nInterestingly, the country’s 0.9 metric tons per capita CO emissions was significantly lower than 1968 Singapore (2.7 metric tons), 1982 South Korea (3.6 metric tons) and 2004 China (4.1 metric tons). In this comparison, the Philippines, at 2011 development level, was closest to 1991 Thailand and 2008 Indonesia, both at 1.8 metric tons of per capita CO emissions. With such a small carbon footprint, the Philippines is said to have remarkably outweighed its CO emissions share by its renewables share from 1990-2014.\n\nSurprisingly, such renewables share is observed to even surpass almost all of the top ten carbon emitting countries ",

The US leader's decision sparked harsh objections from heads of state from the Middle East to Europe and beyond.\n\nSeveral presidents and prime ministers have warned Trump that his decision may risk blowing up the new Arab-Israeli peace initiative and could lead to new violence in the region.\n\nThe Philippine government is yet to release a statement explaining its abstention from the UN vote on the resolution regarding the status of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Philippines was the only nation in Asia that voted in favor of the UN Partition Plan for Palestine on Nov. 29, 1947. The proposal recommended that Palestine be partitioned into an Arab State and a Jewish State, with a special international status for the city of Jerusalem under the administrative authority of the UN.\n\nRELATED: Rallyists in Taguig denounce Trump declaration of Jerusalem as",

He’s the only fighter in history to win world titles in eight divisions from 112 pounds to 154, from flyweight to superwelterweight. It could’ve been 10 divisions but Manny went from flyweight to superbantamweight so he skipped superflyweight and bantamweight.”\n\nPeñalosa says Sugar Ray Leonard is a close second in his book. “In terms of talent, my choice is Leonard but in terms of achievement, no one comes close to Manny,” he says. “If they fought in their prime, it would be quite a match. Manny isn’t just strong, he’s also quick. What makes his punch so powerful is he delivers with all of his heart and soul, like he puts his entire body behind every shot. Line them up. Tommy Hearns, Roberto Duran, Aaron Pryor, Alexis Arguello, Marvelous Marvin Hagler. If they fought Manny at the same weight, Manny would win every fight. Hearns was strong but Manny would take him out because of his glass jaw. Against Leonard, it would just be a matter of time before Manny lands. Manny is a volume puncher and when he fights 12 rounds, you won’t be able to avoid getting hit.”\n\nPeñalosa says not even Muhammad Ali did what Pacquiao has done. Pacquiao turned pro as a minimumweight, scaling 106 pounds in his debut. Then, he moved up in weight to win world titles at flyweight, superbantamweight, featherweight, superfeatherweight, lightweight, superlightweight, welterweight and superwelterweight. Ali was a heavyweight throughout his career and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. claimed world titles in the superfeatherweight, lightweight, superlightweight, welterweight and supe",

The fresh law takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the TRAIN, personal income tax rates will be adjusted to shift the burden off lower-income segments toward the “ultra-rich.”\n\nMeanwhile, projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nUnder its P8.44-trillion 2017-2022 “Build, Build, Build” program, the government aims to jack up its spending on infrastructure alone to P1.899 trillion, equivalent to 7.45 percent of gross domestic product, by the time Duterte ends his term in 2022.\n\nHowever, the estimated tax take from the new tax law is less than the Department of Finance had hoped to raise, with TRAIN expected to generate $1.8 billion in revenues in its first year.\n\nDespite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s TRAIN had also encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nAmid mixed reactions over the revamp of the country’s tax system, what does the new law mean to ordinary Filipinos now that TRAIN has been given a green light to leave the station?\n\nHere are the items covered by the new tax law:",

As much of a pain as it is to head out these days, there’s no escaping all those invites to class reunions and barkada get-togethers.\n\nSometimes we don’t want to veer that far away from home, but it can be a struggle to find a unique place that’s both photo-friendly but still easy-on-the-pocket. For those living in the South, Buku-Buku Kafé might be your answer. Situated between all the usual local and international chains inside SM Southmall is a quaint little café that serves Southeast Asian food.\n\nRun by siblings Jessica and Nicholas Santiago, Buku Buku means “many, many books” in Bahasa Malaysia and was named so in honor of their dad, who lives and works in Malaysia. As an artist and musician respectively, the two started the café as a way to create a space for art and literature to flourish in the South. They have a library of books and zines that you can check out. With a cozy and light atmosphere, the café’s interiors easily serve as the perfect background for all those “candid” group photos. If you’re feelin’ a little extra, the second floor has a wall made entirely of book pages.\n\nIt isn’t just an Instagram-worthy place, either. This Christmas, Buku-Buku is introducing Big Plates in which they’ll offer their bestsellers in larger portions. I recommend the Three-Way Sisig made of pork, tofu and tuna. It’s a hearty meal that has just the right amount of spice and zing, and it’s great for splitting with three to five people. The Darling Tuna Belly, made of tuna steak and peri-peri sauce, is great for those looking for a healthier option. It comes with mashed squash that’s divine. For dessert, try the festive Champorado de Suman, which is like a mash-up of all your typical Filipino holiday fare. Think: champorado shaped as a suman, with a cup of tsokolate on the side.\n\nIf you’re a last-minute gifter, there’s no need to make a mad dash around the mall anymore. The",

Some expected him to say the buck stopped at his desk for the failure of diligence, the meetings that his officials could not seem to remember and the haste in the approval of the Dengvaxia project in the twilight (or midnight) of the administration. He invoked good faith and good intentions. That was that.\n\nFault finders are likely to appeal to the doctrine of qualified political agency to draw President Aquino into the dragnet. After all, decisions of his alter ego executive officials are, unless countermanded or reversed by him, presumed to be his own. This construct is an adjunct to the fiction of a single executive, one who needed a bureaucracy to assist him in executing all the law. In layman’s terms, its simply command responsibility.\n\nThus, battlelines are being drawn on both sides of yet another esoteric governance issue which has joined the debate. In the context of public leadership, where exactly should the buck stop? How much weight is given to good faith, good intentions, presumptions of regularity when decisions go horribly wrong?\n\nThe people’s interest in understanding how something this giant could have happened will remain understandably high. And, until the last of the almost 800,000 valiant but clueless test patients is brought under the State’s monitoring eye, we will be skeptical. It is now up to the investigations of the political departments to unravel the mystery and to determine fault.\n\nHit or miss? Many believe that, even in this day and age, under the most ideal situations, vaccines are still iffy propositions. To the uninitiated, like myself, a huge leap of faith is still required to understand and accept that you need to be injected with the virus to save yourself from the same.\n\nBut no leader is ever gifted with the benefit of crystal ball prognostications.

While American business supports most parts of the Tax Reform and Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill, which was passed by the Senate and House, there is one particular part of the bill which could send the wrong signal to international investors and long-term friends of the Philippines.\n\nSpecifically, the sections of the TRAIN bill that seemingly overlooked the consumers, who want lower prices for their foods and drinks and the right to choose what they consume. If passed, by the bicameral review process this week, the new law would raise prices for Filipinos, restrict choice and result in reduced investment, lost jobs and send a message to investors from around the world that the Philippines is willing to violate global trading rules. The Congress moved forward despite opposition coming from domestic associations and international players who are long-term investors in the Philippines.\n\nThis new legislation should be carefully reconsidered. The House of Representatives and the Senate are currently reconciling their respective versions of the bill and are aiming to submit the final version to President Duterte before they recess on Dec. 16, 2017.\n\nBut if Congress passes this bill, with the unequal provisions on the sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intact, it won’t be Christmas for the consumers or to companies considering investments in the Philippines. The SSB provisions call for a doubled tax rate on sweeteners that are produced largely outside the Philippines but play a critical role in meeting Filipino demand for high quality and affordable food and beverage products.

It is a mixed-use development planned to be built on a 2.8-hectare province-owned property in Barangay Apas.\n\nThe projec",

He said these officials are using the people’s money “for flimsy reasons.”\n\n“Kaya umiinit talaga ang ulo ko (That’s why I’m losing my temper). Come January 1, I told (Executive Secretary Salvador) Medialdea – Well, I do not want to interfere with Congress and the Supreme Court… but here (in the executive branch), no travel now. I’ll cut it. Whatever. Except the diplomats,” the president said during the launching of an agriculture program Thursday in Davao City.\n\n“Ayaw ko na lang sabihin mapahiya ‘yung tao. Basta sabihin ko muna walang travel. Mag-starvation diet muna tayo diyan (I do not want to be embarrassed before the people. I will tell them no travel for now. Let’s have a starvation diet on that),” he added.\n\nDuterte noted that foreign trips require the government to spend for allowances, hotel accommodations and airfare. He also vowed to fire officials who leave the country every month.\n\n“I’ll look for plenty of victims. I will look at everything. Those who travel every month, you go. I do not need you in the executive department,” the president said.\n\n“I will be strict especially in the matters of money.”\n\nCruz was named member of the DAP board of trustees on March 14, 2017. She served an unexpired term of office that began on July 1, 2016 and ended on June 30, 2017.\n\nThe DAP Personnel Association (DAPPER) had urged Duterte to fire  Cruz for alleged unnecessary trips, threatening to terminate anyone who questions her policies and appointing non-plantilla officers to official posts.\n\n“Let us be very clear on this: we are all friends, I do not have a problem with that but when it comes to government interest, forget about it,” he said.\n\nDuterte sa",

They stand for at least an hour if not more and one thing very clear during rush hour is that there are never enough public utility vehicles within that three-hour window. Some people have tried to provide all sorts of solutions to address the need. Along Shaw Boulevard for instance you will notice vans, AUVs and even tricycles willing to take on passengers based on per head charges and at a much higher rate.\n\nBy law, it is all illegal one way or another. Illegal because the fares they charge are often double or triple the legal fares. But the reason they do so in the first place is because if they are caught, the price to pay to get out of jail or prevent law enforcers from impounding your vehicle is a very high price. We really can’t fault the LTFRB, local traffic authorities or the LTO for going after the “colorum,” because they are merely doing their jobs and implementing the law. The problem with all of this is that it does not address or solve the problem: People need a ride during rush hour.\n\nThis is the reason I am calling for INNOVATION and not just REGULATION. The current state of public transport specifically during rush hour seriously needs innovation. When the TAXI industry failed to service the needs and safety of their customers, the innovation came in the form of UBER and GRAB. That innovation initially got bogged down on the issue of “franchise” and remains to be fully sorted out. Now we have the perennial and perpetual problem of jeepney and AUV/van riders not having enough units for peak hours. There are many private vans and AUVs that could double up like Grab and UBER owners but the complicated, expensive and limited number of franchises available turn or scare away would be applicants.\n\nCrazy as it may sound, perhaps the LTFRB and the DOTr might consider studying a way where AUV and van owners can be “part–time or sideline operators” who can",

But as with the National Peace Assembly in Paquibato district of Davao City, the celebration ni Sierra Madre showed the revolutionaries’ determination to support the peace negotiations–as long as the objective of addressing the root causes of the armed conflict are addressed. The Melito Glor Command’s spokesperson, Jaime “Ka Diego” Padilla, once again faced reporters and photographers to discuss the situation in Southern Tagalog as far as the ceasefire goes. They are committed to peace, he says, but one that is lasting and will usher in national freedom and democracy in the country.\n\nPhotos of the celebration in the hinterlands of Sierra Madre:",

Over-eager marketing and public relations people use it in a somewhat cavalier fashion these days to describe products that over promise and under deliver. This is clearly not the case when the conversation turns to Ayala Land Premier’s magnificent golf course at Anvaya Cove. This is a property that absolutely lives up to that lofty billing.\n\nThe 7030-yard course, designed by Golfplan partner Kevin Ramsey, opened for play on Dec. 7 and the universal reaction of the international media and guests present that day could be summed up in one word – wow!\n\n Perched on the hills of Morong, Bataan just outside Subic Bay, the layout meanders in and around the hills about the West Philippine Sea, through verdant rain forests and the surf below. In a stunning move that seems to run counter to a property developer’s interest, Ayala Land Premier dedicated some of the best land on the property to the golf course making it the centrepiece of the 470-hectare development.\n\nRamsey’s firm Golf Plan is responsible for over 200 golf courses in 75 countries including The Club at Nine Bridges, in South Korea, one of only two modern Asian courses ranked on GOLF Magazine’s World Top 100. Ramsey believes that his latest creation belongs in this class. After having played Anvaya a couple of times, I don’t disagree.\n\nEven more impressive is that the Ayala Group prioritized the course’s sustainability and harmony with the environment. This was achieved by minimizing earth movement, saving mature trees and landscaping with endemic flora while routing the tees and fairways to give the impression that the golf course has always been there. It always was but it took a great architect and a developer with a vision to uncover.\n\nWe had the opportunity to play our first round at Avaya with Ramsey and he impressed on us just how serious the Ayala Group was about the concept. Removal of any tree on the property required much deli",

Every season the brand anticipates the pieces we’ll covet for our homes—and always gets it right.\n\nGiven the store’s presence and ability to make or break trends, we wondered: Who are the people behind the brand who have such a strong influence on our homes? Christina Frederick, Anthropologie’s customer styling director, and Anne White, lead home stylist, are two such creatives who are tasked with staying ahead of the curve. The duo leads the décor- styling service, offering insider advice and practical tips to recreate the brand’s enviable aesthetic at home.\n\nHere, they answer our burning home-décor questions, from the only trends we need to know for fall and winter to their top trick for layering patterned accents with ease. Take note: Here’s everything you need to know to decorate your home like an Anthropologie stylist.\n\nWhat are your top trend predictions for fall and winter?\n\nChristina Frederick (CF): Velvet, marble and mixing materials! Velvet can be incorporated into the home at varying degrees. You can introduce a touch of velvet with a small throw pillow or create a bold statement with a velvet chair or sofa. I love the idea of velvet dining chairs as a luxurious update to an existing table. Marble is also a great way to update your entertaining pieces and serveware. A marble cheese board, for example, can add instant sophistication to your holiday spread.\n\nWhile luxe fabrics, like velvet, are having their moment, mixing in organic materials, like wood, is still just as relevant. Natural imperfections showcased in tables, hardware and serving pieces bring warmth to a room and evoke a down-to-earth appeal that’s perfect for the holidays.\n\nWhat about metals and materials?

It’s really time to move on to this new technology to lessen the fraud activities. Aside from being the  requirement by the BSP, there’s a lot more benefits in moving to EMV card, making transactions more secure,” said Peter Magdame, Head of Support Services and ATM Fraud Security of BDO Unibank.\n\nSome banks today still use the magnetic stripe, a 50 year-old technology. “The difference between a chip and magnetic stripe is that the chip possesses encryption and creates unique codes every time one does a transaction. It asks for the code and bank validates the code. In magnetic stripe, no validation is being done,” Magdame explained. He said that BDO ATMs all over the Philippines are EMV-ready already. He suggests that cardholders go to their respective bank branches and ask for replacement of their ATMs to EMV cards. The first issuance is free of charge, subsequent replacement will be charged Php150.\n\n“For payroll accounts, they may coordinate with their HR Department for replacement of the card. It’s high time this Christmas to change to EMV card,” Magdame said. For merchants and financial institutions, the switch to EMV means adding new in-store technology and internal processing systems, and complying with new liability rules. For consumers, it means learning a new payment processes.\n\nRight now, 50% of BDO’s account holders have already migrated to the EMV chip card,",

(AKF) program director Heidi Caguioa charged Joey Mancilla; Arnold Llanto, the van driver; and several other John Does who helped load the canines into the van of violating Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act.\n\nThe case was filed in the office of Marikina Assistant City Prosecutor Peter Steve Lim.\n\nEight of the 40 canines owned by Mancilla died after they were transported in a closed van to a dog show hosted by the Philippine Canine Club Inc.

At that time, Mancilla was already at the venue.\n\nAccording to the petition, the truck van had no shipping permit to transport the dogs, which was in violation of the law.\n\nCaguioa said it was “unimaginable” for Mancilla, a self-proclaimed dog enthusiast who owns numerous dogs and with 30 years of experience as a dog show exhibitor, to transport the animals in such",

Niño are on the final stretch of preparations for the Fiesta Señor 2018 which is expected to draw at least a million people from different parts of the country. “We’re 95 percent ready. Almost everything is in place. We only need some refinements,” said Fr. Ric Anthony Reyes, OSA, the secretary of the 2018 Fiesta Señor Executive Committee, in a press conference on Thursday. The Augustinians await the confirmation of some priests and bishops who were invited to celebrate Masses during the novena and feast of the Sto. Niño. Lawyer Paul Yabao, overall Fiesta Señor consultant, said they were also informed about the possibility that President Rodrigo Duterte will drop by the basilica to visit the image of the child Jesus on Jan. 21. “He may come to the basilica after giving a speech at the Cebu City Sports Center (CCSC) during the Sinulog although we have not received any formal communication yet,” he said. The Fiesta Señor 2018 officially starts on January 11 with the annual “Walk with Jesus”, a penitential foot procession from Fuente Osmeña to the basilica at 4 a.m. Next year’s celebration carries the theme “Sto. Niño: Inspiration of Renewed Disciples for New Evangelization.” In solidarity with war and typhoon victims, the Augustinian fathers will not have any fireworks display on the eve of the Fiesta Señor in January 2018 for a more somber feast. “We decided to instead give the money for the rehabilitation of Marawi City, for victims of the different typhoons, and for the renovation of a church in Villaba, Leyte,” said Fr. Noel Cogasa, OSA, who is in charge of the liturgical celebrations in the basilica. In previous years, the basilica spent around P100,000 for the pyrotechnics display after the one-hour traditional Sinulog dance at the church’s Pilgrim Center. The basilica already sent P300,000 in donations for victims of the Marawi siege last August but found the need to add some more to help victims of the wa",

It just so happened that we faced my former team. But there’s no revenge angle or whatever,” he reiterated in Filipino.\n\nSeeking redemption or not, the 35-year-old forward looked like a man on a mission when he took the court for the Bolts, punishing the Elite as he led the charge in a 103-98 victory.\n\nThe former UE stalwart torched the net as he went 5-of-8 from threes, with his gutsiest long bomb coming off the glass with 11.3 seconds remaining to put the game away for Meralco, 101-95. He finished with  25 points, eight rebounds and two assists in the win.\n\nBut for Cañaleta, he attributed his good showing to his extensive plans coming to this season, saying, “We had a good preparation. I adjusted well with this new team and I didn’t have much difficulty because they were very supportive. They’ve been encouraging me to perform at my best and that’s the reason why I’m really confident playing for Meralco.”\n\nIt also helps that he’s playing for coach Norman Black, the same mentor he had briefly in 2014.\n\nCañaleta’s explosion couldn’t have come at a right time, especially with the Bolts starting the new season without Ranidel de Ocampo and Cliff Hodge, both of whom are dealing with injuries. Still, the Tarlac native knows what he brings to the table for Meralco and he’s willing to hold the fort for his new squad as the Bolts go through this tough stretch without their usual starting forwards. “I’ve been in this league for so long and I know that I don’t need to rush anything. All you need to do is to be calm and control your emotions. It’s only then when you’ll be able to do what you need to do on the court,” he said.",

He said the pension fund’s board has yet to discuss a timetable for its disposition.\n\nEarly this year, the GSIS invited local and foreign real estate developers, institutional developers and hotel industry players to bid for the 25-year lease and development of the three-hectare property located within the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex in Pasay City near Manila Bay.\n\nThe Coconut Palace used to host the Office of the Vice President, but Vice President Leni Robredo had instead opted to hold office in the Quezon City property previously dubbed the “Boracay Mansion,” which former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada supposedly owned.\n\nBut now, Aranas said the GSIS was instead looking at short-term leases for its assets for practical purposes.\n\n“If you go long-term lease, with the prices already pegged, sometimes it doesn’t make sense … 25 years from now, the prices will be higher,” Aranas explained.\n\n“We want short-term leases, because that way we are economically viable. But the problem with short-term lease is that the investment will not be so big, because, of course, they want to recover their investment,” he added.\n\nIn the case of the Coconut Palace, Aranas noted that “it’s already developed—it’s already an icon.”\n\n“We don’t want to have drastic or dramatic changes in the Coconut Palace,” he said. —BEN O.

Then told me to shut up,” Isla said and cried.\n\nHer mom and dad hugged her and promised that everything would be alright. But they were worried because it wasn’t the first time.\n\nBut that was a long time ago.\n\nOne day, Isla showed a video to her classmates – a jiu jitsu competition in which she was a contestant. Since then, no one has bullied her.\n\nBorn in the Philippines, Isla Sobejana Diesmos, 10, immigrated to Canada with her father, Jeff, a chef, when she was three. Her mother, Kristela, is a teacher in a Montessori school.\n\n“I was an OFW. As dependents, Jeff and Isla could have come along but we decided for them to just stay in the Philippines until such time that we became permanent residents,” Kristela says.\n\nLike any kid, Isla loves watching movies and reads pocket books like the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series; she loves Barbies and dollhouses. In school she likes Social Studies, Science, Math, and excels in Arts, according to Kristela.\n\nAnd like most kids, Isla was not spared from bullying because she looked frail, small and shy.\n\nKristela and Jeff reported the bullying to her school, but it did not end there.\n\n“Self-defense class is what came in to our mind. After some searching, we stumbled upon Brazillian Jiu Jitsu Fight Club also offering karate, wrestling, jiu jitsu and muay thai,” Kristela relates.\n\nIsla chose jiu jitsu because it is “gentle.” “Ju” is translated as “gentle” in Japanese.\n\nShe enrolled at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Fight Club Calgary in April 2015, attending two sessions a week. Today she trains four times a week.\n\nThe principle of Brazilian jiu jitsu focuses on putting the bigger opponent on the ground and applying chokeholds and joint locks.\n\nJiu jitsu reached Brazil in 1900s when Esai Maeda, the chief of the Japanese Immigration Colony, taught the art to his Brazilian friend Gastao Gracie.

All the issues fall between January and October, except Woman’s World, which brings us back in time to Christmas 1958.\n\nUnlike the other periodicals printed on acidic newsprint, yellowed and brittle with age, the magazine Woman’s World was printed on sturdy paper stock that looks as fresh as the day it was issued 59 years ago.

I don’t mind doing that. But if it’s just the same mother-whose-child-is-missing role, you can’t help but start thinking, ‘OK, I need to do something that will excite me.’ And I haven’t been excited for some time,” Dawn told reporters at a recent press conference for the Metro Manila Film Festival entry “Meant to Beh.”\n\nThat’s why she agreed to do the comedy film “Meant to Beh,” a welcome breather from all the drama television series she has been doing the past seven years.\n\n“I really enjoy discovering comedy, because it’s a genre that I don’t typically get to do. All my ideas about comedy are all in my head, because I have never gotten the opportunity—I was never offered sitcoms or anything of the sort,” she said, adding that she’s kalog when she’s with her friends.\n\n“But no one gets to see that,” Dawn said.\n\nDoing comedy is a challenge. But with Vic Sotto as her leading man, work gets significantly easier and more fun. “This is especially difficult for me, because making people laugh is dependent on many things, like timing. But you learn by just observing your coworkers, like Vic. I also rely on my director (Chris Martinez) for guidance,” she said.\n\nThe story of “Meant to Beh” is close to Dawn’s heart, because like Andrea—the character she portrays—she, too, is a mother of preadolescent children. Her son, Jacobo, is 12; her daughter, Ayisha, is 8.\n\n“As a parent of youngsters, I try to make sure to keep them disciplined and at the same time make growing up fun for them,” Dawn said. “More than the money or toys, it’s the time we spend together that will s",

It could be the look may not be so formal, because you can’t avoid that some people may be intimidated with the look of a branch,” BSP Deputy Governor Chuchi G. Fonacier told reporters in a recent ambush interview.\n\nFor one, Ms. Fonacier said a lite branch may be set up in a marketplace, which would effectively extend full banking services within a structure that’s more open and enticing to low-income Filipinos, versus the imposing vibe of branches often seen in business districts.\n\nLower processing fees will also be imposed on transactions done in these smaller bank outlets.\n\nExisting BSP rules allow banks to set up branches — which do deposit-taking, service withdrawals, and maintain complete sets of books of accounts — as well as extension offices and other banking offices, including microfinance units. However, branch-lite offices will be excluded from the computation of capital requirements.\n\nAll banks may choose to set up branch-lite units, although such plans would still have to be approved by the Monetary Board similar to proposals to open other banking offices.\n\nThrough this, the BSP hopes to bring financial services to 570 cities and towns in the country which have no access to banks.\n\nThe National Baseline Survey  by the central bank in 2015 showed that only 43% of Filipino adults had savings, with 68% of them opting to keep their money at home rather than placing them as bank deposits.\n\n“With simplified and more flexible",

This means a pack of cigarettes which now costs P30 ($0.60), will cost P32.50 from January until June 2018, then P35 until December 2019, P37.50 until 2021, then P40 until 2023, with an increase in tax of four percent annually from 2023 onwards.\n\n\"The very small tax increase is both alarming and unsatisfactory because it is totally inadequate to further discourage youth from smoking and to generate revenues to finance the expanded universal health care in the medium to long-term,\" said Sopaphan Ratanachena, Tobacco Tax Program Manager of the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (SATCA) in Bangkok.\n\nThe alliance called on President Rodrigo Duterte to veto the tobacco excise tax before he signs the TRAIN bill into law. The tobacco excise tax is in \"package 1\" of the tax reform bill, which is expected to take effect January 2018 and generate P130 billion in revenues.\n\nSATCA is a multi-sectoral alliance supporting Association of Southeast Asian Nations members in their tobacco control policies.\n\nDuring Senate deliberations on the bill, there were moves to more than double tobacco taxes to 10 percent annually. This should result in additional P50 billion ($1 billion) in revenues and at the same time force more than 1.5 million smokers to kick the habit, said Senator Risa Hontiveros, vice chair of the Committee on Health and Demography.\n\nAnother anti-smoking lobby group, Health Justice Philippines, proposed \"at least\"",

But Fermin said he had miscalculated. His mother Pureza, and stepfather, Gregory, live and work in Bermuda.\n\nHis parents made plans to come home for the holidays, and decided to take a Philippine Airlines flight because their son began working for the company in March. The trip had been planned for a year, and Fermin knew of his parents flight details a month in advance.\n\nCloser to the date of his parents' flight home, Fermin found out that his friend was part of the flight crew. He made arrangements with his superiors and the pilot to let him fly the plane carrying the precious cargo back to Manila. And did all this without his parents' knowledge.\n\nHis parents would be traveling a long way. From Bermuda they would fly to New York, take another plane to Vancouver, and then finally fly to Manila.\n\nFermin covered the last stretch of the flight - Vancouver to Manila on December 18.\n\nIt was during the two-hour layover in Canada when the reunion took place.\n\n\"While walking to meet them, I was nervous, excited, and happy. Surprises aren't really my thing,\" Fermin said.\n\nBut the experience of seeing his parents so overjoyed was \"th",

He “retired.”\n\nHe became a senator of his home republic. He said a remark against gay people. Nike bade him goodbye. He un-retired. The popularity’s “waning.”\n\nA year after Pacquiao’s loss to Floyd Mayweather, Jr. and the lawsuits both boxers faced afterwards, the Pacquiao the world knew to be quick but packed in punching power had to sway irrelevance. The moment he said last April that he’s “retired,” the world and his home country was to naturally see a path for great boxers.\n\nGo to the sunset. Humbly thank fans for the memories. Cement your legacy.\n\nSo when Pacquiao announced he will fight the WBO Welterweight Champion Jessie Vargas November 5th, the market was perplexed. The Nike sponsorship withdrawal started off the firestorm. HBO rejected broadcasting the fight, saying the Nov. 5 bout “fell too close” to Sergey Kovalev versus Andrew Ward at heavyweight (two weeks apart, November 19). HBO also relinquished broadcasting Pacquiao’s remaining fights after coming out of retirement.\n\nSome think Vargas isn’t a pay-per-view draw. The cheapest ticket at the Thomas and Mack Center of the University of Nevada in Las Vegas was US$50, compared to US$154 during Pacquiao-Bradley 3 last April at the MGM Grand.\n\nBut look at what happened Nov. 5 at a university in Las Vegas. The unthinkable —a 37-year-old who’s still lightning quick and packed with powerful punches, and who won a 12th world title— happened. Thomas and Mack Center was 16,132 strong. The “Manny! Manny!” cheers boomed.\n\nBack home, the viewing parties at drinking bars in Metro Manila diminished. Some streets were busy with people, although some areas like roofed public basketball courts had community-wide telecasts of the fight.\n\nTop Rank Promotions the PPV broadcaster gained.

A child’s relationships and values will be shaped by the most important adult of his growing up years.\n\nOnce a child starts to explore and discover their own interests and passions, parents must encourage their children to learn beyond the fundamentals – by allowing them to expand their horizons on their own.\n\nSocial interaction is important for a child’s learning process. It helps build a child’s identity by training them to be independent and exposing them to different personalities and situations.\n\nBut admittedly, this milestone is scary for parents. Allowing a child to engage in playtime in new environments may have its tradeoffs.\n\nLearn how to deal with the benefits – and possible consequences – of playtime. Drag the arrows left to right of the images below:\n\n1. Discovering sense of self – More questions about oneself\n\nSocialization is proven to encourage learning among younger children. As they learn more about other people, they also learn more about themselves: how they’re like others, how they’re different from others.\n\nAs their social circle grows, children may have more questions about themselves. Here, a parent’s role is crucial. They can answer children’s questions and support them in their interests to further hone their skills, which can prove useful in their adult life.\n\nBringing a child into an uncontrolled environment can be worrisome for parents. During playdates, for example, a child will be exposed to many different people and an entirely new space. Parents will not be able to control what their children touch, eat, or interact with.\n\nLetting go is part of every parent’s journey. Preparation for the unknown begins at home: children must be fed the right food and drinks to strengthen their immune system. When shopping for milk, parents must always make it a point t",

The type of AI usually presented in films – ones which can feel, think on their own – are called general AI.\n\nStephanie said data for the latter isn’t accessible to everyone. “It’s a competitive advantage. The volume of data you’d need to build that is probably not gonna be available to you or to people in general.”\n\nNarrow AI provides solutions to basic problems, and we can only go further. “Big companies are setting the tone on how AI can be used.

No one would quarrel with that. In fact, the Philippines has lingered around those levels of notoriety through the years.\n\nJournalists being democracy's designated frontliners for unearthing and exposing official wrongdoing, their safety is naturally a critical concern. But, lest the forest be missed for the trees, the Philippines is actually one of the world's most dangerous places not just for journalists but for its very own people. A survey of presidential history illuminates the point.\n\nThe excuse is not seldom given that the Filipino people are a condemned child of history; the fact is they have been victims of a run of corrupt and high-handed leaders that began with Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThrough 14 years of martial law, from 1972, Marcos racked up a formidable record of murder, torture, enforced disappearances, and plunder. The great flush of popular revolt by street vigil in 1986 did succeed in sweeping him out of power, bloodlessly, and in installing a democratic successor, but it failed to stop a rebound of reactionary forces.\n\nAlready saddled with a plundered and debt-ridden economy and a damaged culture, Corazon Aquino had yet to fight off 7 coup plots. That she managed under those conditions to get a constitutional democracy reestablished was achievement enough: it provided her successor and revolt partner, Fidel Ramos, with an institutional framework for socioeconomic reconstruction.\n\nDoubtless helped by being once a Marcos general, Ramos himself served out a coup-free term and responded with a productive leadership. But, after him, the nation, under Joseph Estrada, went backsliding so dramatically he had to be stopped in midterm; he was impeached for plunde",

(READ: Guns, Fealty, and Money)\n\nThere were other notable things about the Maguindanao vote that year: a turnout of at least 90% for all of the 22 municipalities – staggeringly high compared to the rest of the country – and the loss of critical election paraphernalia attesting to the results which caused the national canvass for senators to drag beyond the end of May 2010.

A friend of the Ampatuan family told me when I visited the province weeks after the elections, “Whatever the President wants, he will follow.\" For that election, the source noted, \"12-0 is what Ma’am (then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo) wants.”\n\nThe 2007 elections were the last manual elections the country had.

A big change or shifting into something entirely new and unfamiliar – where it’s not just about you and your own needs and wants anymore.\n\nWelcome to parenthood. Where life is now also about another human being that you will carry in your womb for 9 months (!!). A life that will be about learning and unlearning, and full of challenges and surprises. But also a life now with greater purpose and meaning.\n\nHolaina Tan or Holen, gave birth to baby girl Akira aka “Aki” in 2013. They have been inseparable ever since.\n\nShe says that her husband, Jason, has always been supportive. When they found out that she was expecting, they decided for her to focus on her pregnancy and resign from her full-time job. Holen shares: “This was my first pregnancy, and I wanted to have a wonderful experience, too. For me that was a good foundation: look at the pregnancy holistically and try not to stress and fuss and just have a wonderful time.”\n\n“I’m a full-time mother and a housewife. My kid and I are together day in and day out for the most part, so I need her to understand that mama has other jobs to do and not just take care of her. It’s tough when you’re a stay-at-home-parent, they can get really attached, but it also gets better once they are able to help out in the house, even with small things.”\n\nFrom the start, she made sure that she taught Aki to have a sense of responsibility, to be aware of how things worked out at home and there were rules to follow and not forced upon.\n\nHolen shares that one of her struggles was to break free from some practices she experienced when she was a child. “It can be such a default mode for moms, tell them to do something because ‘I said so’ so I really try to catch myself and watch out,” she shares. And this led her to develop her own par",

However, these programs last only for a few months due to financial constraints.\n\nThis is one the reason why Senate Bill 1279 or the \"National School Feeding Program Act\" was introduced to institutionalize school feeding programs across the country to combat hunger and undernutrition among students.\n\nSpeaking at the End Hunger Summit 2017, Senator Grace Poe emphasized the importance of sustainable school feeding programs in public schools to address the hunger issues among students.\n\n\"I believe that hunger is inconsistent with basic human rights and dignity,\" added Poe, one of the co-authors of SB 1279.\n\nIn the Philippines, there are 3.1 million families suffering from hunger. That, according to the senator, equates to around 15 million Filipinos.

Starting off with 10 centavos in his pocket, Henry Sy Sr is now the Philippines' richest man with an estimated $12.7-billion personal fortune as of end-2016.\n\nBut it was not an easy feat for the Chinese migrant. The Sy family's businesses underwent difficult economic and political upheavals over the years, from World War II up to the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nSM group founder Henry Sy Sr was only 12 years old with 10 centavos in his pocket and no knowledge of English when he followed his father to the Philippines. Sy thought his father, a migrant from China, was well-off. But it turned out his father just owned a sari-sari store along Echague St in Manila's bustling Quiapo district.\n\nDuring World War II, the Sy family's sari-sari stores were burned. His father went back to China, while Sy started looking for other business ventures.\n\nIt was in 1958 when Sy first ventured into the shoe business, selling surplus GI boots and eventually opening his first shoe store in Carriedo.\n\nWith no more local shoes to sell, Sy started to look overseas for broken sizes, mainly for Filipino women. This made Shoe Mart the most efficient shoe business at the time.\n\nIn 1967, Sy bought Acme Savings Bank, which he then renamed to Banco de Oro. He ventured into banking to provide cash management to suppliers. He was competing versus Good Earth, COD, Remson, and Isetann back then. With a bank in his portfolio, he was able to outgrow all of them and became the last man standing.\n\nMarried to a vendor of lace, Sy thought of branching out and selling other products like children's wear.

Posetti has been studying harassment of journalists in the digital space since 2011.\n\nShe authored the UNESCO study, \"Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age,\" which sought to encourage journalists to train themselves on digital security, educate the public, and advocate for institutional reforms to protect journalists and their sources.\n\nThe massive study, which covered media trends in 121 countries, showed increasing threats to investigative journalism as new laws and technologies make it more difficult for journalists to protect the identity of sources.\n\nCyberharassment is usually gendered, says Posetti. She described attacks against women journalists as often sexualized and intimate – preying on women's race, physical appearance, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and family members.\n\n“It can involve images that are designed to confront, images of decapitated bodies, of women being raped, or images of an individual journalist altered into a meme,” Posetti said.\n\nThese attacks, she said, are intended to create fear, tarnish the credibility, and cause the retreat of women journalists who were writing investigative reports or critiques of personalities or institutions.\n\nDuring her talk, Posetti shared anecdotes of women reporters who were called words like 'slut', 'bitch', or 'presstitute'.

According to these reports, agencies owned by foreign entities used by illegal agents are paid $500 for every applicant they are able to bring in. Women from Mindanao comprise most of the victims of the scheme. (READ: 'Slow' gov't process makes OFWs fall for illegal recruiters)\n\nAccording to Geslani, the backers are mostly from the Middle East, some of whom are married to Filipino women to be able to conduct their business in the Philippines.\n\nDOLE is currently conducting an internal cleansing and investigation of the irregularities inside POEA after they received continuous reports of illegal recruitment with some of their employees earning as much as P250,000 from it.\n\nThis has prompted DOLE to suspend the processing of overseas employment certificate for two weeks in November.\n\nPOEA officer-in-charge and labor undersecretary Bernard Olalia said that this recent claim is another matter that they may separately investigate.\n\nDeployment of HSWs continues after it saw a steep rise of 70% in 2016. Some 194,973 domestic workers were deployed in 2015 while 275,073 flew out in 2016.\n\nUsing POEA figures, a study by LBS Recruitment Solutions noted that the 201",

Now, we enter an era where esports – regardless of what game you play – is welcomed and celebrated in its entirety, where homegrown talent can be supported and reared to become world-class.\n\nMainstream growth aside, esports also secured a large foothold in the scholastic scene this year.

In line with their #LoveLocal advocacy, Bench brought together participants from fourteen countries across four continents to create a version of Freddie Aguilar’s timeless song unlike anything seen or heard before.\n\nCrafted from the performances of sixteen children of OFWs, “Bench - Anak” weaves together multiple languages and dialects to reflect the multinational upbringings experienced by many Filipino families. Among the performers are Bench endorsers Rocco Nacino and Max Collins, who know all too well what it’s like to have parents willing to sacrifice everything to provide for their loved ones.\n\n“As a kid, siyempre hindi ko pa naiintindihan lahat. Ba’t kailangan mo umalis dito,” says Nacino, who grew up in the Philippines while his father worked as an engineer in Singapore. As for Collins, who was able to live with her mother who worked as a store manager in Vallejo, Califarnia, the situation was no less difficult, as she grew up as an outsider for most of her life. Fortunately, the strength and support of her mother saw them through: “My mom is like my best friend.

One lesson there is that business establishments, especially those whose owners are not in good graces with the mayor, should straighten out their acts before they become targets as well.\n\nBut it’s not that Vic Enterprises is fighting City Hall.

I thought it was just like any other place for children to have fun with rides and all.\n\nTo my surprise, the ABS-CBN project through its subsidiary and Kidzania franchise territorial licensee Play Innovations Inc., was far from what I imagined it to be. It was something where kids from four to 17 years can lay their hands on things and activities that are usually done by adults.\n\nI have to thank ABS-CBN and the people who were tasked to invite us for such an awesome experience.

The retired national correspondent of the “Atlantic” has a “wife” and a house in one of the first-rate subdivisions in Negros. He was waiting for his bedfellow in a coffee shop doing a five-hour shopping inside the mall.\n\nThat was his third cup of coffee when I joined him in his table after I saw one vacant chair. I introduced myself so that we can start a conversation. He is Steve Goldberg and in his late 70’s. Our roller coaster conversation started from “taming a wife” to China’s intervention in the South China (our West Philippine Sea) up to federalism.\n\nI motivated him to talk more about federalism, being an American. His story telling made me interested. He said that the relative strength of the national government versus state and local governments has constantly changed over the course of American history. From 1787-1913, there was “dual federalism” in America.\n\nThe national government concentrated its attention on the “delegated” powers… national defense, foreign affairs, tariffs, commerce crossing state lines, coining money, establishing standard weights and measures, maintaining a post office and building post roads, and administering new states. State governments decided the important domestic policy issues: slavery (until the civil war), education, welfare, health, and criminal justice.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, the challenge of two world wars, and the Great Depression paved the way for “cooperative federalism” (1913-1964). Both the nation and the states exercised responsibilities for welfare, health, highways, education, and criminal justice. Through the grant-in-aid device, the national government cooperated with the states in public assistance, employment services, child welfare, public housing, urban renewal, highway building, and vocational education,\n\n“Centralized federalism” came to the picture from 1964 up to 1980.

The spark was the lobby by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the House appropriations committee to delete funding for infrastructure projects in districts represented by 24 opposition and militant lawmakers.\n\nThe verbal exchange has exposed the use by pro-administration lawmakers of the national budget as a tool for political patronage. Alvarez used the “weder-weder” lang argument of former president Joseph Estrada in defending the move. But while the budgeting process has been used by past administrations as a political tool, the act was mostly hidden. The difference now is that Alvarez, et al, are gleefully waving it.\n\nThere’s arrogance there, one that is borne by the belief that even if it is displayed, the public wouldn’t frown on it. As one affected lawmaker rightly said, it is obvious that power has gone to the heads of some pro-administration lawmakers. For Alvarez, the intention was to weaken opposition to his schemes in the House. Its effect may be seen in the next budgeting cycle. Will the opposition be silenced?\n\nBut there is one other point exposed in the verbal exchange, the presence of the discredited pork barrel in the 2018 budget. One Makabayan lawmaker, Antonio Tinio of the party-list Act Teachers, referred to it as “hidden pork”: earmarked for the congressional districts but accessible only to the concerned lawmakers.\n\nSen. Panfilo Lacson, who has made it his advocacy to battle “pork,” has seen through the scheme in the House with withdrawal of funding for the projects in the districts of the 24 “undesirable” lawmakers. If lawmakers were deprived of funding, a “chosen few” from both the Senate and the House are, in contrast, “getting billions of pesos in areas of their choice and districts.”\n\nLacson correctly used the phrase made famous as the title of a Ricardo Manapat book on crony capitalism during the dic",

Based on media reports, the landfall will hit greater than the previous typhoon that hit Mindanao in 2011,\" Emano said.\n\nEarly this week, Emano convened all department heads and rescue personnel of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) to discuss rescue measures and relief efforts if the calamity strikes.\n\nEmano said the disaster teams will be on red alert if a typhoon will have its landfall anywhere in Mindanao.\n\n\"So, I've talked with the department heads already and prepared everything by December 23, and told them...and even apologized to their families that we might not be able to celebrate Christmas with them because we will be preparing for the calamity,\" Emano said.\n\n\"Hopefully, it will not come, but all our heavy equipment are ready,\" Emano added.\n\nEmano said the capitol has 500 strong, equipped and trained personnel of the PDRRMO with different expertise.\n\nThe eight province-owned hospitals are also getting ready to cater medical needs of residents.\n\nMeanwhile, the capitol's top official is calling on the National Government to fast-track the construction of the mega dike project in Barangay Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City.\n\nEmano said he is willing to accommodate the temporary transfer of offices that would likely be affected by the construction at the vacant facilities within the capitol compound.\n\n\"We really need the mega dike. We cannot afford anymore of another 'Sendong' to hit us, which we call the 'big one', and we'll be losing lives and limbs again in the province and in Cagayan de Oro City,\" Emano said.",

Even athletes and exercise buffs are not exempted with the yummy treats that are offered on the table, and it gives them the sense of guilt not to give-in and to give-in, and a bigger percentage would not have that fortitude to resist the temptation of food.\n\nExperts says you do not need to, as long as you do not resort to gluttony. As an athlete, your motivation of not getting over your limit is the hard work and sacrifices you already have invested, only to be compromised by complete loss of discipline. The guilt is a good thing that borders your limit and reminds you that while you are not forbidden to eat, you are limited to just enough.\n\nWe have to remember that food is not an enemy, it is actually an ally that provides nutrition, but just like any ally, when it is too much, makes more harm than good. So while on vacation and with family enjoying the holidays, any food should not be hoarded, and should be shared by everybody.\n\nExercise buffs are also reminded specially those who are self-learned and self-trained that there is danger in exercising too much to compensate the amount of food intake for the holidays. Many resort to rigorous exercising to compensate with their eat all you can parties, which is a big mistake causing their body to be in pain and their metabolic system to malfunction. You cannot force the human body to grind all your food intake in an instant, nor you can work out rigorously in advance thinking that it gives you the green light to eat as much as you want.\n\nHolidays especially in the Philippines are challenging times for athletes and exercise aficionados one thing that should not be forgotten is the virtue of discipline and it shall have less negative effect to us.\n\nHappy Holidays!

About 288,000 small-scale fishers rely on the bounty of Tañon, which is part of the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape (TSPS).\n\nThe area is supposed to be exclusive fishing grounds for municipal fishers, but the competition from commercial fishers who illegally enter the strait, plus destructive fishing methods used by small-scale fishers, have led to an overall decline in productivity, said Oceana Philippines, a conservation and advocacy group.\n\nIn a joint statement, Oceana said that from an average of 5 kilos of fish per trip, yields have plummeted to 2 kilos—and many fishing households earn less than P100 daily, prompting various stakeholders to come together to put in place a management framework to sustainably manage their coastal and marine resources.\n\n“Tañon Strait is an important traditional source of fish for millions of Filipinos. Doing the right thing for Tañon paves the way for the sustainable use and management of our fisheries to address food security concerns,” Oceana Philippines Vice President Gloria Estenzo Ramos said.\n\n“No Filipino should go hungry in this native land. I believe we can achieve this if we protect our coastal and marine resources,” Negros Occidental Gov. Alfredo Marañon said.\n\nDeclared a protected area in 1998, Tañon Strait is a 161-kilometer long channel separating the Islands of Cebu and Negros.\n\nIt is famous not only for being a rich fishing area, but as a tourist destination.\n\nIn the channel lies popular tourist sites, such as Bantayan Isle, Malapascua, Moalboal, the Mantalip Sandbar and Bais, where whales and dolphins abound.\n\nEncompassing three provinces, 42 coastal towns and cities, plus nearly 300 barangays, overlapping mandates have led to largely inconsistent policies in conserving the area.

Five cagers from Gavina’s fold registered double-digit production with former Road Warrior Eric Camson leading the charge with 24 points.\n\nTagged as the whipping boys of league, Kia was put on the hot seat after forgoing the first overall pick — which could’ve been Christian Standhardinger — in a bid to employ an “unconventional” approach in the new PBA season.\n\nFans and followers even went as far as translating the offseason move as Kia’s disinterest in competing.\n\n“I gave everybody this baller,” Gavina bared, pointing to a rubber band around his wrist. “[It] says ‘Nothing is impossible with God’ and that’s the mindset going in.”\n\n“If we put in the work, hopefully in our next game we come out on top,” he continued.\n\nFor three quarters, Kia was on the driver’s seat. Heck, they were even able to lead by as many as 13 markers in the game. If not for Larry Fonacier's four-point play late in game, the outcome would’ve been different.\n\nWhile falling short in their opening game definitely hurt, Gavina said they are keeping their heads up.\n\n“We showed our grit tonight. We showed a great deal of character in being able to keep up with what I feel is one of the contenders coming into this conference,” he explained.\n\n\"If we can do this against NLEX, we can do this against anybody,” Gavina declared.",

The consortium will work with foreign technical partners with proven world class track records and experiences in airport operations to improve, upgrade, and enhance the operational efficiencies of NAIA covering both landside and airside facilities,” the consortium said.\n\nThey said that like other countries, the Philippines could benefit from having an in-city and out-city airport such as Tokyo and London.\n\n“Numerous foreign and local experts have highlighted the advantage of keeping an airport within city limits. Like other major cities in the world, experts recommend an in-city airport and another one outside the metropolis to complement it. Megacities that benefit from a two-airport set-up include Tokyo (Haneda and Narita) and London (Gatwick and Heathrow),” they said.\n\nThey aim to upgrade NAIA to accommodate an additional 11 million passengers from the current 39.5 million and increase its hourly aircraft movements (landing and take-off) from 40 movements per hour to 48 movements per hour.\n\n“The unsolicited proposal is intended to help accelerate the government’s Build Build Build program.

Worse, we have seen how victims of these weather events suffer endlessly with the snail-paced rehabilitation efforts by our government, as shown by the Yolanda tragedy where the people affected are either given substandard homes or are still living in subhuman conditions four years after the infamous typhoon struck and despite the downpour of financial assistance.\n\nThe paper entitled: “Blameless in Stratosphere: Carbon Footprint, Manufacturing Growth, and the Fuel Mix Debate in the Philippines,” presented in a Stratbase-ADR Institute roundtable discussion, is able to put in context the Philippines’ contribution to climate change. Essentially, it highlighted that the Philippines has a very small carbon footprint with per capita carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions lower than African countries such as Angola, Congo and Djibouti. Notably, Dr. Raul Fabella, et al. looked at other Asian countries in their respective years of comparable development to 2011 Philippines.\n\nInterestingly, the country’s 0.9 metric tons per capita CO emissions was significantly lower than 1968 Singapore (2.7 metric tons), 1982 South Korea (3.6 metric tons) and 2004 China (4.1 metric tons). In this comparison, the Philippines, at 2011 development level, was closest to 1991 Thailand and 2008 Indonesia, both at 1.8 metric tons of per capita CO emissions. With such a small carbon footprint, the Philippines is said to have remarkably outweighed its CO emissions share by its renewables share from 1990-2014.\n\nSurprisingly, such renewables share is observed to even surpass almost all of the top ten carbon emitting countries in the same period.

The new excise tax on automobile is a bit surprising as it doubles the rate of P1 million and below net manufacturing costs while lowering the rate for luxury cars or more expensive automobiles,\" he explained.\n\n\"With the offsetting measures to recover the revenue loss from lowering personal income tax, the fear of some sectors is not unfounded as it may really result to increase in prices of goods and services,\" the tax reform advocate said.\n\nBut he thinks the government is not indifferent to this as it has appropriated budget for social security measures to subsidize at least the poorest P10 million households.\n\n\"And with the increase in take home pay, they estimate that it will still outweigh any increase in prices,\" he said.\n\n\"In the end, if we want the tax system to work for us, we need to do our share,\" Abrea emphasized.\n\n\"Businesses, small or large alike must do tax planning to prepare for all these changes and commit to pay the right taxes, while the government must find all means to simplify it and assist taxpayers pay their taxes correctly and on time,\" he explained.\n\nAbrea said a genuine tax reform is wher",

I wonder if there is a way by which all our incumbent politicians could set aside their respective pride and ambitions, their self-interests and personal plans, to make Cebu the premier province and city outside of Metro Manila. And, I dream that they form a Cebu Coalition of Leaders. I dream of a united Cebu, to be led by senior politicians like former Cebu congressman, former governor Eddie Gullas in tandem with retired former congressman and former governor Pabling Garcia, and perhaps former senator Serge Osmeña. This triumvirate plus the wisdom of Chief Justice Jun Davide should convene all Cebuano leaders and form a united front. The time has come to unite.\n\nMy dream team is for Vice Mayor Edgardo Labella to run for congressman to replace Raul del Mar, who should retire by now from politics and become a senior ambassador. After all, he has already proven that he is a good and honest leader. Edgardo is the new blood who can well represent the district with more dynamism, more passion, and more visibility for the Cebu brand. Mayor Tom should stay in the City Hall because we need continuity and discipline in the city. The criminals are afraid of him and he loves the policemen. Mayor Tom is beginning to look like Digong, and I like that. Former mayor Rama should run and win as congressman in Cebu City south and really make our city well-represented as a brilliant lawyer, parliamentarian, and legislator. Labella and Rama will make a better tandem to make Cebu City better represented in the House.\n\nGovernor Junjun Davide’s temperament is suited for the House representing the second district. Willy Caminero should become Governor since he is a man of action rather than words. And Representative Gwen is now ripe for the Senate. We have no Cebuano senator and Gwen is the most well-known with her sterling performance as Deputy Speaker. President Digong ",

Choose books that are special to you, perhaps a childhood favorite or one that influenced or transformed your life in some way. Give them to everyone.\n\nThey don’t read? Give it to them anyway—the book might spark an interest. Or, choose a book on a topic that they like.\n\nLooking for recommendations? Creative writing professor Cristina Pantoja Hidalgo recently posted on social media a list of 27 books by Filipino authors, among them F.H. Batacan’s Smaller and Smaller Circles, that has been made into a movie. The list was picked up by two other writers and published online.\n\nHere’s a suggestion: give a book of ghost stories. It was the tradition back in England in the centuries leading up to the post-Victorian era to tell or read ghost stories at Christmas, hence Charles Dickens’ ‘A Christmas Carol.’\n\nThe book’s spooky premise is that a mean Grinch of a man changes his ways after being visited by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. It is really a morality tale, but the supernatural elements fit it right into this tradition.\n\nMore recently, there was a BBC production of M.R. James’ ghost stories starring Christopher Lee called “Ghost Stories at Christmas,” with Lee playing James, who was a university professor, telling his stories to a group of students all agog. Look for the episodes on Youtube.\n\nYou don’t have to buy new books to give as gifts—you can visit your favorite thrift book shop and pick up a lot of bargains there. This strategy is best don",

But barangay officials are not as happy. Barangay Captain Rey Ompoc said they lost revenues that they were supposed to earn from Vic Enterprises’ operations in their barangay. Ompoc said their barangay gets a 10 percent share of the total amount of taxes paid by the construction materials supplier to City Hall. The company, Ompoc said, is also very supportive in the implementation of barangay-initiated projects and activities. Vic Enterprises would make donations of sacks of cement to help in the rehabilitation of classrooms in public schools located in the barangay and sound system for the St. Joseph’s Parish. “Dako gyud nga kawala ang pagsira sa Vic Enterprises diri sa among barangay.

Copies of the mayor’s closure order were posted on their main offices, stores and warehouses on Thursday.

Her lawsuit seeks to invalidate parts of the settlement, arguing it violated California law and that USA Gymnastics “had a plan to keep the sexual abuse of Nassar quiet.”\n\nMaroney, who is now 22 years old, said in a Twitter post in October that the abuse started when she was 13 and attending a U.S. national team training camp in Houston. Nassar told her at the time that she was receiving “medically necessary treatment he had been performing on patients for over 30 years,” she said at the time.\n\nHer attorney, John Manly, said she had been abused between 50 and 100 times by Nassar, including at the Olympics and during the world championships.\n\nShe has described Nassar giving her a sleeping pill while the team traveled to Japan for the 2011 world championships. Maroney says Nassar later visited her in her hotel room after the team arrived in Tokyo, where he molested her yet again.\n\n“First and foremost, she wants this never to happen to another little girl,” Manly said in an interview.\n\nThe settlement included nondisclosure and non-disparagement clauses and Maroney or her parents could be sued for more than $100,000 for violating the agreement.

This platform is called Agos which crowdsources online reports to connect those in need.\n\nAs a newbie journalist who covered the disaster beat, churning out knowledge pieces and running after local government officials for their disaster management plans were part of the day to day.\n\nWe try to combine the hard facts with creative storytelling to engage the reader.\n\nPart of our coverage included discussing the impact of the \"Big One\" – a 7.2-magnitude earthquake – that could happen when the West Valley Fault Line moves.

While the reasons for their rejections vary, not even the President's confidence could save them.\n\nThe first to go was former foreign secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr, who was rejected by the CA in March for lying about his US citizenship. His rejection followed months of him denying that he was ever a US citizen, or that he owned a US passport.\n\nA day after his rejection, Yasay said there is a \"better life\" for him beyond his rejection, and that leaving the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) means being able to do his \"favorite things,\" like spending time with his family, more freely.\n\nYasay has remained active on Facebook since his rejection, sharing personal posts about his family and his travels, as well as his photos playing golf. Occasionally, he also shares Bible verses, online quizzes, funny internet memes, and random videos.\n\nAside from his usual posts on politics, Yasay also continues to support Duterte – from the impeachment case filed against him, to his decision to declare martial law in Mindanao.

From smartphones to virtual assistants to virtual reality, innovations continue to come in the form of new physical designs such as we've seen with Apple's iPhone – arguably the most hyped phone of the year.\n\nAlong with this, we saw the continued push for new consumer-facing technologies such as augmented reality, cryptocurrencies, and AI-focused chips such as the ones found in new Huawei flagship phones. In no particular order, here's what we witnessed in 2017 from the world of consumer tech:\n\nApple’s 10th anniversary phone, the iPhone X, was clearly the most anticipated handset of the year. The media frenzy following the announcement in September was one for the books, which had top tech global websites jostling for a leak and paying top dollar for prior information, even betting on how it was going to be named.\n\nThe hysteria was somewhat doused when it was finally revealed that the brand new iPhone would sell for way over a thousand dollars, the most expensive smartphone ever. In the Philippines, the iconic phone is selling for approximately P64,000 plus, with variations in installment and incentive pricing from Smart and Globe.\n\nThis is also not to forget that Apple has another advanced smartphone in the running, the iPhone 8, although most of the attention truly had been sopped up by the X.\n\nThe silver lining in the iPhone X cloud is that it gave competitors a wide enough room to wiggle in and compete aggressively specs for specs and a share of consumer’s wallet. Samsung, which got toasted in 2016 with the global recall of its burning flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7, rebounded this year with a brand new smartphone, the Galaxy Note 8.\n\nEarlier in the year, we also saw the Galaxy S8 and a",

Lee Van Corteza snapped off the 14.1 (Straight Pool) World Tournament last October, which is not officially a WPA-sanctioned event but might as well be due to the strength of the field.\n\nBiado's triumph caps a banner year for the La Union-born, QC raised 34-year old.

Biado finally gets his 9-ball world crown after finishing second in the 2015 world ten ball championship.\n\nThis achievement once again casts the spotlight on pocket billiards, which I strongly believe to be our best sport. It's also a game that needs a shot in the arm, as televised tournaments have disappeared, and pool halls are shuttering. BEC in Magallanes, one of the few remaining pool venues in Makati, for example, is closing its doors at the end of this year.\n\nAs Reyes and Bustamante, the two-headed Mount Rushmore of Pinoy pool, wind down their illustrious careers, pool seems to be fading into the sunset too.

Despite his dominance against Calacar (3-2-6, 1 KO), a former amateur teammate of Barriga's from Davao del Sur, Barriga was content to potshot and move after a punishing first round, never pushing his advantage or pursuing a knockout.\n\nWhat Barriga did show was that he'd been studying the moves of Vasyl Lomachenko, stepping behind his opponent when he tried to hold, and landing cleanly with his back hand as a lead ala Floyd Mayweather.\n\n\"He's a good boxer, sometimes you have a fighter or opponent, he knows what is your style, he studies you,\" said Barriga, 24, of his opponent. \"Sometimes he checked my style, that's why sometimes it's so hard to get him.\"\n\nMP Promotions matchmaker Sean Gibbons, who was in town to announce the next title defense for IBF junior bantamweight champ Jerwin Ancajas earlier in the day, said he sees the case to fast-track Barriga into the world title picture due to his extensive amateur background and experience as a 2012 Olympian.\n\n\"I could see him absolutely fighting early next year for an IBF eliminator or WBO, and then potentially a world title by the end of the year,\" said Gibbons. Barriga is ranked number 5 by the IBF at 105 pounds, where the champion is Hiroto Kyoguchi of Japan, while Japan's Ryuya Yamanaka holds the title with the WBO, where Barriga is ranked number 6.\n\nThe fight was Barriga's fifth of 2017, and first since he outclassed two-time world title challenger Samartlek Kokietgym in Beiji",

(READ: Duterte: Manila will be a 'dead city' in 25 years\n\nSome Filipino friends told me that the reason for this decay was the destruction of Manila during the Second World War, but pictures of the capital in the ’50s and the ’60s are proof that, not so long time ago, Manila was still a very pleasant city to live in.\n\nFor Filipino politicians, travelling to well-planned cities would be a good starting point in order to establish a comparative analysis. Which ordinances did those cities implement in order to provide a better standard of life to the citizens? It would not be a bad idea to force Filipino mayors to take a mandatory course on the basics of urban planning – an important task where they tend to show the utmost lack of understanding, given the sorrowful state of most Filipino cities.\n\nThe problem of the liveability of Metro Manila is a big one and the causes of the dysfunctionality are relatively easy to point out. The real challenge is to face the economic forces and the lack of certain incentives among citizens that have pushed the city into the current situation.\n\nCorruption might be one of the causes. I cannot honestly imagine a Filipino mayor denying the permit for the construction of a condo tower or a big mall in an already congested area when offered by a wealthy developer. Citizens only react when a well-known landmark is threatened, as it happened with Torre de Manila (a project that was in the end approved) and a mall planned in Rizal Stadium (it has been saved by the historical commission).\n\nTraversing EDSA recently from Magallanes to Cu",

Let the seasoned politicians debate whether mass vaccination is a good election campaign strategy.\n\nHowever, it if it were just a well-designed, planned, and implemented mass vaccination campaign, the following would have happened:\n\nFirst, the designated subnational program manager would have the experience and expertise of running a vaccination initiative. If done right, such would include major components, like vaccine services, cold chain logistics, behavior change communication and health promotion, social mobilization and community participation, disease surveillance, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nIt is worthy to note the Philippine Children’s Medical Center (PCMC) had none of these competences. The main reason for the salection of PCMC as implementor was directly attributable to the late issuance of the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO), an authority to incur obligations, and the Department of Health (DOH) practice of sub-allotting funds to government medical centers to procure items for the department’s central office.\n\nSecond, when one plans for a new, big health project, the primary consideration is achieving the “highest chance of success.” If the target individuals were Grade 4 school children and the vaccination sites wo",

These sessions aim to gather aspiring financial advisors and those looking to succeed in career and life.\n\n“Life is all about living it brighter and better despite difficulties,” said Jonathan, who hails from a family originally based in Aklan.\n\nHis mom was determined to give her children the best education. The whole family moved to Manila, and Jonathan was enrolled in a private all-boys school.\n\nHe got in on a scholarship and was, for his entire academic career, financially pressured to succeed. “Anak, you’ll get kicked out if you’re not number 1,” his mom would say.\n\nThis was when he began to yearn for a better life.\n\nSometime after he entered college, Jonathan noticed a lump on his right chest.

She served as QC vice mayor from 1992 to 1995.\n\nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Former Quezon City Vice Mayor Rosario \"Charito\" Planas died on Thursday, December 7. She was 87 years old.\n\nQuezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista confirmed the news through the city's Public Affairs Department.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that [on] behalf of the people of Quezon City, I announce the passing of our dear former vice mayor, Charito Planas,\" Bautista said.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Quezon City Council expressed their condolences to the Planas family, \"with heartfelt gratitude for her work and legacy as a true public servant.\"\n\nBorn on April 28, 1930, Planas is the sister of Carmen Planas, the first woman councilor of Manila. She earned her law degree from the University of the Philippines.\n\nPlanas fought the Marcos dictatorship by questioning before the Supreme Court, through Planas vs. Comelec, the plebiscite that ratified the 1973 Constitution.\n\n\n\nLater that year, she was arrested by authorities, joining other Marcos opponents in detention. She was then placed under solitary confinement when military officials became \"unhappy\" about her \"boosting up the detainees' morale.\" Planas was released years later to undergo a medical procedure.\n\nIn 1978, she was among the candidates of the Lakas ng Bayan (Laban) party, led by Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr, for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) elections.\n\nPlanas fled the country soon after and continued anti-Marcos efforts abroad. After the People Power Revolution in 1986, she returned to the Philippines.\n\nHer QC mayoralty bid in 1988 was unsuccessful, but in 1992, she won as vice mayor, serving until 1995.\n\nShe later became the deputy spokesperson (with the rank of undersecretary) of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from 2010 to 2011.

They were on their way to Utod village, Nasugbu, Batangas to monitor civilian casualties from an earlier encounter between the military and the NPA.\n\nThe nine individuals arrested are members of Samahan ng Pinagbuklod na Damdamin (Sapida), a farmers’ group in Calaca, and Habagat, a fisherfolk group in Lian, Batangas.\n\nThe five farmers from Calaca are: Leonardo delos Reyes Jr, 44; Carlos Sanosa, 64, Joey Castillano, 47; Roberto Hernandez, and Peping Murillo. The four others from Lian are: Jocelyn Cabadin, 44; Jennylyn Bayani, 30; Orlan Cabadin, 19; and Anthony Bañaga, the jeepney driver.\n\nThe nine are being detained at the Nasugbu municipal jail, but police are yet to file charges.\n\nIn September this year, the military conducted aerial bombings in Batangas after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) had an encounter with NPA. More than a week later, on October, four peasant leaders were arrested in Calatagan, also in Batangas.\n\nIn a statement, the Karapatan Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights (Karapatan) condemned what it called “illegal arrest” of the peasant activists.\n\n“How then can human rights and humanitarian organizations function and aid civilians amidst armed conflict when rights of human rights workers are being curtailed?” Karapatan secretary general Tinay Palabay said.\n\n (This articl",

I don’t hate anybody or else I won’t be inviting you to my place.”\n\n -- President Duterte to the Malacañang press corps\n\nCONTRAST President Duterte’s statement to the Filipino press with President Trump’s potshots at the U.S. media.\n\nTrump has called journalists “the enemy of the American people” and “the opposition party” and branded news reports he dislikes as “fake news” and reputable news organizations (such as New York Times, Washington Post, NBC and CNN) as “failing” enterprises.\n\nDuterte admits the press is an adversary. “(The relationship) is always adversarial,” he told the Malacañang press corps as he partied last Dec. 12 with reporters and photographers covering him.\n\n“Adversary” means of course “opponent or enemy.” Unlike Trump though, Duterte claimed he doesn’t hate journalists. At least, those who were at his Christmas party. He said he wouldn’t have invited the Palace reporters if he hated any journalist in the room.\n\nNews reporter and news source need not love each other; if they do, that’s disastrous to the public that the reporter serves as surrogate. They need only to be civil to each other.\n\nTrump has taken it out of the realm of civility and pretense, escalating his assault on reporters and writers who don’t praise him. He throws insults at media in general and specific reporters or news outlets, on Twitter and in rally speeches, mostly “ad hominem” accusations or responses. The truth is how he sees it or wants it to be.\n\nDuterte is generally not combative with media. On the contrary, he agrees about journalists’ job. He conceded that getting the truth is media’s “business” and “quest.”\n\nThat offers some comfort. And this: Duterte affirms that “public interest” is the overriding concern. But his idea of what is good for the public may not be the same as what dissenters think. Which media pursues in questioning the president, resulting in friction and at times an outburst, such as when reporters asked about his alleged human ri",

Ramil Hernandez announced a gift-giving program on Facebook and on tarp streamers in his province: “GIFT-GIVING CUM FEEDING...” That drew a mix of flak and snickers from people who know “cum” as obscene.\n\n[] House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez scrapped a number of public works projects from the 2018 General Appropriations Act, branding as “undesirable” the 24 House members for whose districts they were identified. Reaction ranged from “that’s life, they got what they deserve” to “public money is used to silence the opposition and punish the people.”\n\nOne is an exercise in language. The other is flexing political muscle.\n\nCritics of Governor Hernandez’s message must know syntax to see the obscenity and/or humor in it. Being naughty here requires linguistic knowledge.\n\nWithout a comma after “gift-giving” and “cum feeding” not hyphenated, the word “cum” cannot be the vulgar slang for semen or “what men ejaculate during sexual encounters.” The word “cum” as a preposition in the governor’s line means “comes with,” “together with,” or “combined with.” Nothing wrong with “GIFT-GIVING CUM FEEDING” unless one reads it as “GIFT-GIVING, CUM-FEEDING.”\n\n“Cum” as a noun is “very obscene” and “inappropriate.” With the dirty spin some people give his message, the governor may find it tough to say with a straight face, “Come now, nothing wrong with our ‘cum.’”\n\nThose who cheer or accept Speaker Alvarez’s decision to scrap projects for districts of 24 “undesirable” House members are die-hard “partidistas” or jaded political watchers who see an administration bent on using all weapons in its arsenal.\n\nArguments for it are trite but somehow valid: It’s done by any administration.

He said, DepEd Region 7 released a memo requiring coaches to attend a seminar--at P3,500 a pop--before they could be allowed to coach in the regional meet.\n\nThat’s troubling because, according to Rico, the seminar could be the perfect way for some teachers to get the spots of the coaches who won their way to the Cviraa.\n\nI also asked my friend Francis Ramirez, the sports coordinator of DepEd Cebu City and he said the seminar is one way to weed out fly-by-night coaches, which is also a good purpose.\n\nBut one thing that concerns me, is making the seminar a requisite for coaches to participate in the Cviraa. Isn’t winning the City or Provincial meet enough? Shouldn’t that be the requisite?\n\nAnd who will be conducting the seminar? Coaches in Cebu who lost to the coaches who will be participating in the Cviraa? Experts from the national team?\n\nAnd at P3,500 per head, the five-day seminar, which will be held during the Christmas break, is very expensive. How many officials are there in Region 7? 1,000? That’s P3.5 million for a seminar.\n\nThat is quite expensive.\n\nI also saw the modules and while coaching ethics and legal responsibilities are useful topics, I don’t think that at the Cviraa level, these coaches need a course on the basic rules, interpretation of the rules and basic training.\n\nThese coaches won’t be at the Cviraa if they don’t know the basics.\n\nSo again, I hope DepEd reconsiders its stance on the seminar. It’s pretty late in the day to call it off, but I hope the officials won’t make it a requisite for the Cviraa.\n\nCoaches also have personal lives you know and I’m sure a lot of them made plans for the Christmas break, only to have it ruined because they have to attend a course on topics they are already experts on.\n\nLet those teachers who want to be coaches but have no knowledge on the basics join this seminar but don’t ",
