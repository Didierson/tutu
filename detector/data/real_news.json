Residents of these areas should be on alert for possible flash floods and landslides. It could make landfall on Thursday evening or Friday morning.\n\nLocal officials can also consult the map uploaded on MGB's website which indicates the areas prone to rain-induced landslides with 3 colors – red, green, yellow.\n\nMGB explained that the red areas are highly susceptible to landslides. If a storm passes through a red area, people need to be alert. When water saturates the area, a landslide will likely occur.\n\nIn its report, MGB said that people living in red areas should always be ready to evacuate. The longer the rainfall, the more vulnerable the red areas become. Those in red areas are mountains with steep slopes, fractures, and structurally weak rock formations with a history of landslides.\n\nOn the other hand, green areas are moderately susceptible to landslides. People living here, however, still need to be careful. These are usually mountains and rock formations with moderate slopes.\n\nYellow areas are less likely to experience landslides. Landslide debris, however, might still affect the areas as they could become an accu",

Language, in particular, evolves so organically online that you could easily fill a dictionary with terms that came about on Facebook posts and Twitter threads. From \"facepalm\" to \"jejemon\" to \"bae,\" these words slip into our lexicon without our knowing it, and we end up using them in the real world without a second thought.\n\nThis year saw many new words and phrases surface via social media, and chances are you've used at least a few of them recently. Here are some of the most popular ones:\n\nSeveral months into Donald Trump's presidency, we've come to terms with the fact that the United States' Commander-in-Chief isn't going to stop tweeting off the top of his head anytime soon – national security or global policy be damned.\n\nBut when this unfinished tweet floated around the internet just after midnight of May 31, it felt like The Donald's Twitter account had reached a hilarious new low. It appears that \"covfefe\" was meant to be \"coverage\" and was accidentally sent out to the netiverse before the thought was even completed, but of course, it now means whatever you want it to mean, like a confusing abstract painting.\n\nMonths later, a similar gaffe happened to the official account of our own Presidential Communications team, almost as if the Philippines didn't want to be outdone by Trump's high-jinks.\n\nThis turned out to be arguably the mildest mistake the team has made in 2017. The government-run Philippine News Agency (PNA) used a Wikimedia Commons photo of the Vietnam War in its article about the Marawi siege, used canned pineapple manufacturer Dole Philippines' logo in an article about the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and even published raw editors' notes in article titles. \n\n\n\nThe official account of the Presidential Spokesperson also posted a troll-like comment and hastily took it down.

Most books will tell you that it’s having a huge capital, finding the right location, targeting the right market, or creating attractive advertisements.\n\nYes, these are essential factors to consider but for a business to thrive and stay for the long haul, it must have the most important secret ingredient of all – purpose.\n\nThis is what our speakers, Jourdan Sebastian, CEO of Taclob, and Raf Dionisio, Co-founder of The Circle Hostel, shared with us during the #WhatsNext workshop held last November 11.\n\nJourdan and Raf are both owners of successful businesses with a purpose. (READ: #WhatsNext: How ‘telling good stories’ can lead to business success)\n\nFor the participants, this piece of advice helped them identify the kind of business they would happily wake up on Mondays for.\n\nOne of them is Kristina Aiza Tan. She originally wanted to expand her family’s private resort business by building some of her own. But after hearing from Jourdan, she realized that what she wants to do instead is to sell eco-friendly utensils, plates, and other disposables that are usually packed for trips to a resort.\n\n“At our resorts, we’ve always encouraged our visitors to bring their own plates and utensils to minimize waste,” said Kristina. “Now, I know that what I really want to do is to help protect the environment.”\n\nWhile for some, this nugget of wisdom validated the kind of business they’re already in.\n\nPaolo Tomacruz and Job Corpuz (and Danaraye Torres) are a couple of college students who started a t-shirt business called ‘Magiting’. It aims to promote Baybayin, a form of Filipino writing that’s now being forgotten.\n\n“We take so much pride in other things like Manny Pacquiao. Why not take pride in something we can also be proud of like our old way of writing,” said Job.\n\nWhat started as a school project is now a profitable business t",

The urgency with which they run tells us that something is amiss – and the next scene tells us it has to do with the royal marriage. Between Queen Elizabeth (Claire Foy) and Prince Philip (Matt Smith), there is a quiet, brewing intensity so powerful you might find yourself gasping for air before you even realized you’d stopped breathing.\n\nAs far as series openers go, this one packs a one-two punch. In just a few minutes of screen time, it quickly reminds viewers of (or introduces them to) what is perhaps The Crown’s greatest strength: the commanding presence and chemistry of its two leads. In the same breath, it defines the point at which we now find our main characters: no longer in the first blush of marital bliss, one of them settling deeper into her royal duty, the other continuing to cling to his former freedoms.\n\nThe compelling opening is rightly reassuring, if only because The Crown’s stunning first season is undeniably a tough act to follow.\n\nAfter all, as the show continues without the fascinating character that is Winston Churchill (played perfectly in season 1 by John Lithgow), the noble father figure that is King George VI (Jared Harris), or the swoon-inducing early marriage of a young Elizabeth and Philip, one might say that The Crown comes into its new season rather crippled.\n\nYet in the British spirit of “Keep calm and carry on,” it moves along on its historical timeline unruffled. The stories continue to unfold with the same evocative gravitas and sumptuous production value as it always has.\n\nThe second season’s story starts in February 1957, when Prince Philip returns from his 5-month royal tour around the world. It then doubles back to a few months earlier, when Queen Elizabeth faces the 1956 Suez Crisis which her new prime minister, Anthony Eden (Jeremy Nor",

Not to mention national call-ups because both teams are manned by several members of the Philippine Azkals, the country's national football team.\n\nBoth teams had fought hard for their finals ticket in the two-legged semifinal.

Gameplan host Mara Lopez and working mom Trixie Monteron try out a suspension training class for the first time to help us gain insights on how this type of exercise works.\n\n“Suspension training is a form of training where you use suspension trainers to put yourself out of balance on purpose. It improves the strength of the core. That’s very important in sports, in recreational activities, or just in everyday living,” shared Gabriel Soriano, a strength and conditioning coach at the 360 Fitness Club.\n\nAccording to Gabriel, beginners usually find this exercise intimidating because of the equipment used for the workout and the lack of understanding that this type of exercise can be modified based on a person’s fitness level.\n\n“It’s not something I would’ve tried on my own because my perception of it is it takes a lot of strength to do the moves. And strength is not something I have right now,” said Trixie.\n\nOne of the things that motivated Trixie to try suspension training is that it’s an exercise you can do anywhere as long as you have the equipment needed. “You can take it anywhere. You can just purchase the equipment, you can hang it on the door, and do it while in the comforts of your own home,” she said.\n\nBecause of its unusual set-up, suspension training helps improve stability, increases muscular endurance, and is also the perfect full-body workout for people who are looking for something that’s quick and effective.\n\n“I definitely worked out a lot of parts of my body that doesn’t get worked out on a normal basis because you go on weird positions. You go on these different angles. A whole different target muscle would be affected,” shared Mara.\n\nAt your own pace\n\n“What I found suitable for me is that you don’t have to be perfect at it at once. I needed to adjust a bit, and see where I’m comfortable, and yet I still try to push myself and try to get the most out of the w",

Will small businesses benefit from TRAIN? Were your proposals considered to make sure we support the fast-growing micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the country?\n\nYes. I am very happy to say that our government listens to us taxpayers. When we proposed a simple and lower tax for small businesses, the Department of Finance (DOF) already included it in the pipeline for comprehensive tax reform.\n\nOur initial proposal is to introduce a flat 10% tax based on gross from small businesses. In the Senate version of TRAIN which was approved on final reading on November 28, they proposed an 8% flat tax in lieu of business and income tax for small businesses.\n\nHowever, after further study of our proposal, I realized that some large corporations are only paying an effective rate of 5% or lower due to tax planning or tax avoidance schemes, while the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is using as well a 5% threshold for value-added tax (VAT) and income tax payment. So, why not allow small businesses – which we proposed to be those making P5 million and below in annual gross sales – to pay a flat 5% tax to be filed and paid annually to encourage voluntary compliance?\n\nFurther, as reiterated in our letter to our senators, we are proposing an exclusive Salary Tax table so we can collect more from self-employed individuals and professionals with the simple and lower tax rate of 5% and 15%, respectively.\n\nIn an interview, you were quoted as saying that self-employed individuals and professionals are not paying the right taxes. Is it true that only employees are burdened by our high income tax rate?\n\nBased on the presentation of Marikina 2nd District Representative Miro Quimbo during our Tax Forum early this year, he highlighted that 99% of employees are paying taxes while only less than ",

A common reaction to the announcement was: why only 90? It must be just the first batch, with the 90 mostly members of the PNP officer corps.\n\nThe President surely believes that there are more than 90 “gangsters” in the police service. He had once described the PNP as “rotten to the core.” Besides corruption, cops have been implicated in criminal activities including kidnapping, carjacking and drug trafficking. The President’s so-called narco list includes police officers including generals. In his bloody war against illegal drugs, vigilantes executing civilians are widely suspected to be the so-called “ninja cops” who are permanently silencing potential witnesses against them. Purging the PNP of such scalawags is overdue.\n\nThe President should not limit his anti-corruption purge to the PNP. It can be extended to other agencies notorious for corruption such as the Bureau of Customs. The Department of the Interior and Local Government also has disciplinary powers over barangay offices. In local governments, the President can prod his political allies to conduct similar purges. A thorough housecleaning is always welcome as the nation rings in a new year.",

Refusing to be trapped in poverty, the young Peñaflorida obtained scholarships and other forms of financial assistance to put himself through elementary and high school. He made full use of the assistance and opportunities, receiving top honors in obtaining his degree in computer technology from San Sebastian College-Recoletos de Cavite.\n\nPeñaflorida’s mission began when he was just 16, when he helped start the youth group Dynamic Teen Company.

The gifts, the reunions, and the long vacation make memories of Christmas happiest at childhood.\n\nBut something with adulthood transforms Christmas. A heartbreak, the loss of a loved one, or an illness that coincides with the season can suck the life out of it.\n\nFor those of us who have experienced a tragedy, no feast can bring back its joy. At best, Christmas is merely a moment of fleeting gladness.\n\nIn this light, Christmas has become an annual ritual of misery in which one is compelled to perform joy. Why not? Its bright lights have cast only shadows. The happiness of other people only deepens one's loneliness.\n\nThey know that Christmas is no longer merry. And attending Christmas parties has become a burden.\n\nChristmas trumps every other season. That is true as far as our culture is concerned.\n\nEaster, which is far more significant in the Christian annual cycle, does not even compare. We count down to the birth of Christ, but not to his death and resurrection.\n\nThat ours may be the longest Christmas season in the world is a testament to how much we value it. We anticipate it with gladness and even prolong it. I have at least two neighbors who don't bother to bring down their decors at all.\n\nIn a way, the enduring charm of Christmas lies in its simplest joys: Misa de Gallo, puto bumbong, and Noche Buena.\n\nBut over the years, much fanfare has drowned out its simplicity. This has taken place in a surreptitious manner.\n\nEvery sale at the mall, every Christmas party, and every gift exchange all bring us together. The irony, however, is that they have all created an atmosphere in which the things of Christmas have overshadowed its relationships.\n\nConsumption, festivities, and all the fanfare impress upon us that the busier it is, the merrier our C",

One look at the Ceres Negros roster and you can see talent overflowing. It almost seems unnecessary to have that many skilled, high-priced players on your squad.\n\nBut the past few weeks have shown that if Ceres really wanted to win a title, they had to pay for excess quality. Most teams would not have been able to cope with the season-ending injuries to Manny Ott, their slick-passing midfielder, and goalscoring machine Fernando Rodriguez. But the Negrenses kept trucking along, out-playing Kaya 3-1 over two legs then routing Cebu on Saturday.\n\nIain Ramsay and Bienve Marañon picked up the slack in the scoring department, while Stephan Schrock and Junior Muñoz assisted in the final. Global actually had plenty of chances in the first half and could have made a game of it, but their defense froze under the Panaad floodlights.\n\nThis team was built for silverware, and after an underwhelming regular season (they even lost to JPV Marikina) the squad delivered when it mattered.\n\nOne word about Schrock: we all know that he can make pinpoint, perfectly-weighted passes. But on Saturday we witnessed him do that with a huge puddle in the way. No doubt he has seen a lot in his long career, including his share of waterlogged pitches. See it on this clip.\n\nGlobal Cebu showed plenty of character this season. The bridesmaids can take a bow. They succeeded off the field by drawing the biggest paying crowds among all the clubs. On the field they battled back as the fourth seed to beat top-seeded Meralco to make the final. They also came from a goal down twice against Albirex Niigata Singapore in the Singapore Cup final only to lose the shootout 3-1.\n\nWith a new ow",

But the mood turned somber when the Department of Education (DepEd) kicked off the program here in war-stricken Marawi City.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 13, Education Secretary Leonor Briones went to the Camp Bagong Amai Pakpak Elementary School to begin the DepEd's efforts to repair and rebuild 15 of the 69 schools damaged by the war between government troops and homegrown terrorists.\n\nThe months-long fighting completely destroyed 22 schools within the main battle zone, while another 47 schools outside the area are in need of major repairs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Briones was welcomed by grade-schoolers who performed several songs for her, including their rendition of \"Awit Para sa Marawi.\"\n\nIt was then that Briones saw 9-year-old Nor-asiah Jutbamangarun crying while singing the song.\n\n\"I asked her why was she crying, and she said she wants Marawi back...

(READ: SWS: 3.1 million Filipino families suffer from hunger in Q4 2016)\n\nThe Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) also noted worsening malnutrition, saying in a 2016 report that \"stunting rates were 30.3% and 33.4% in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\"\n\nChronic malnutrition among children 0-2 years old is at 26.2% – the highest it has been in a decade.

The Gospel readings often end with the declaration, “This is the word of the Lord.\"\n\nBecause of this, faithful followers dare not question the priests who proclaim the gospel because they are seen as acting in the person of the head of the Catholic Church, Jesus Christ himself.\n\nThe Catholic Church in the Philippines counts at least 80,304,061 followers or 80% of the entire Philippine population, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority. Also in the millions is the home-grown Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) which has about 2.3 Filipinos followers.\n\nNo doubt the faithful listen. They listen when they are taught how life should be lived or which leaders they should vote for.\n\nThey listened when Jaime Cardinal Sin, together with those who opposed the Marcos dictatorship, rallied millions to EDSA to put a peaceful end to decades of martial law in 1986. They heeded again, years later, another call to topple yet another leader, Joseph Estrada, who was ousted from the presidency in 2001.\n\nNo doubt the Catholic Church and INC are among the country’s most influential institutions. Wielding power from the truth they espouse, these religions are, however, also prone to controversies and abuse.\n\nBut more often than not, they are left unchecked because of how they are revered as institutions beyond question. This has not stopped us, however, from checking on reported abuses – even if it means being at the receiving end of hate and threats.\n\nThe late award-winning investigative journalist Aries Rufo set the bar for covering issues involving the Church.

They don't focus on what could go wrong; instead, they look forward to the payoff when everything goes according to plan.\n\nThis characteristic is seen in Sun Life’s short film “Waves,” which tells the story of Marco and Amanda, a millennial couple trying to make it work long-distance.\n\nAs with every relationship, they encounter waves of ups and downs.\n\nBut when Marco passes away, it seems as if any future they could have had together died along with him.\n\nBut what Amanda doesn't know is that Marco had planned ahead. He named her the beneficiary of his personal accident insurance – which reveals how eager he had been to pursue a future with Amanda.\n\n“Marco was smart. He was really forward-thinking,” brand ambassador Matteo Guidicelli observes in a reaction video he made with some friends.\n\nThe unpredictability of life was also brought up.

Although the group supports the overall tax reform, they are against the provisions on sugary drinks, which they have dubbed as “anti-poor.”\n\nAccording to the group’s computations, 40% of the average sari-sari store owner’s daily income come from sales of sweetened drinks. PASCO adds that the proposal will make these products more expensive and therefore less appealing to ordinary consumers.\n\n“Paano na lamang po ang kabuhayan namin kapag naisabatas na ang dagdag buwis na ito? Nangangamba kami na tuluyan nang mawawala ang aming maliliit na negosyo,” PASCO said in a statement. (What will happen to our livelihood once the additional tax gets passed into law? We fear that our small businesses will die.)\n\nIn the past, netizens have also expressed concerns regarding statements that the tax will help curb sugar consumption among Filipinos.\n\nConsumer groups such as CitizenWatch and BK3 (Bantay Konsumer, Kalsada, Kuryente) have rallied behind the store owners, and called on the government to amend the proposed taxes.\n\nSo far, it seems like the Senate has listened.\n\nIn the Senate-approved version of the bill, in the first two years of the reform, drinks with c",

It’s set in a gloomy, gritty version of modern-day Los Angeles, reimagined so that fantasy creatures – orcs, fairies, and elves – coexist with humans. There's a social hierarchy in this LA: elves are at the top of the rung, while orcs are the bottom-feeders. Humans are caught in the middle.\n\nSmith stars as Daryl Ward, a human cop whose partner, Nick Jakoby, played Edgerton, is the first orc to be part of the police force. The two stumble upon a powerful weapon: a magic wand that can only be wielded by rare beings called Brights. On of them, Leilah, played by Rapace, leads a rogue group of elves who are working to bring back the forces of evil at any cost.\n\nSmith, Edgerton, and Rapace attended the red carpet event, along with Olivieri, who plays Ward's wife in the film. Also at the Tokyo premiere, which  was invited to by Netflix, were director David Ayer and producers Eric Newman and Bryan Unkeless.\n\nThe film is a reunion of sorts for Ayer and Smith, who worked together for 2016's Suicide Squad. \"We're friends now,\" Ayer quipped, saying that he loves working with Smith because \"he's a positive person, a very happy man.\"\n\nAyer said that the action sequences were particularly difficult to direct because most of them were real – including the smoke and the explosions.\n\nRapace, who had to do fight scenes in high heels, said the experience was \"very intense,\" but that playing the villain was fun.\n\nEdgerton described the movie as \"weird.\"\n\n\"It's f",

Dark Phoenix is in November [2018],” Sophie said in an interview with Variety.\n\nWhile HBO has not confirmed the news, the longer wait time for the 8th season is not surprising. The upcoming season will have just 6 episodes in total, though each one will last an hour and a half long.\n\nWe’re ready to bet that HBO will not be holding back on special effects on this one, as CGI-heavy elements such as dragons, wildfire, and a fleet of whitewalkers gain a bigger role in the story.\n\nAs the final season, it’s also meant to tie up quite a handful of story lines – which means some tricky narrative navigation on the part of the writers.\n\nThis means that it might very well be more than a year’s wait before fans see new episodes of the show, whose most recent season finale saw two beloved characters unknowingly committing incest, a long-held fan theory finally being confirmed, and the Wall crumbling with the help of a zombified ice dragon. – .com",

Here’s how\n\nMANILA, Philippines – The older we get, the bigger our spending power is.\n\nBut having a bigger paycheck doesn’t mean you can go all out and buy everything you want. It’s the time when you should be more conscious of the purchases you make, particularly for major ones like a wedding, home renovation, your kids’ education – or else, you put yourself at risk of financial trouble.\n\nAdults are expected to make better, smarter purchase decisions but sometimes, even they fall into the trap of making missteps that hurt their finances.\n\nAvoid making expensive mistakes that could keep you up countless nights by following these tips.\n\nWhen it comes to big purchases, doing it impulsively and for shallow reasons obviously don’t cut it. Don’t be swayed by distractions like popularity of a brand, by the belief that the more expensive an item is, the better; or by thinking that someone else might get it before you can, among others.\n\nSleep on it. It’s an age-old piece of advice but it’s something people still tend to forget upon seeing something they really like.

The top brands are facing issues and some criticism. Google's Pixel phone is seeking to shake things up but a local release hasn't been announced. Younger brands are continuing to feed the market with budget-friendly offerings. Especially with Christmas around the corner, the good-looking XZ is in a position to steal some of the attention from consumers looking for a new top-tier handset.\n\nWhat might make you strongly consider the phone? Its proposal to be the best phone at capturing action shots. Nowadays, it's expected for premium phones to feature stunning resolutions and rich colors. The XZ, based on our short time with it so far, fairly has that down pat. The photos look good. But what's not always expected is this: the feature set to capture moving subjects. Typically, you'd want to bring out a proper DSLR if, say, you want to take photos of children, pets or sporting activities.\n\nThe XZ presents itself as a device that can be relied on for such instances. It's been given a slew of focusing and stabilization technologies and manual settings to accommodate action shots.\n\nTo prove their point, Sony had media sit down in front of two teppanyaki chefs.\n\nHave you ever been at a teppanyaki restaurant where a chef does culinary acrobatics in front of you? If you have, have you ever said to yourself, \"Man, I wish my phone could capture all that onion-chopping action\"? No? That's all right. We've never thought of it too.\n\nSony did though.

Thousands have marched in protests across the Arab world. Clashes erupted between Palestine and Israel, leading to the death of two Palestinians in Gaza, shot by the Israeli army.

You meet new people, visit new countries [and] you get in touch with different cultures. It was fascinating for me when I was very young and now I travel around the world,” he shared.\n\nToday, he is determined to share what Italian cooking and dining is all about. Finestra, the first Italian Steakhouse in Manila, serves a wide selection of premium steaks like Australian Blackmore Wagyu beef, Snake River Wagyu beef and USDA Omaha Angus beef. To complete and complement their masterpiece, they also serve delicious antipasti, seafood and pasta dishes and melt-in-your-mouth desserts to complete the Finestra dining experience.\n\n“I like to see what people like to eat in the countries where I am, then I will adapt a little bit of my cuisine to their taste.

With Finestra, he’s determined to change how Filipinos perceive Italian fare. “Filipinos are crazy about their meats. Let them discover how we do it in Italy,” he said.\n\nAccording to Marchetti, steaks in Italy are served during special occasions, so he wanted Finestra’s take on it to be extra-special as well. “We want it to be a centerpiece in [the] restaurant, it has to be a celebration in a way.

This is applicable not only when it comes to sharing content, but also when dealing with other people online.\n\nIn a world inundated by both real and fake news and other sensational content, Gonzalez suggests people actively combat the fake news phenomenon by thoroughly reading articles and checking their sources.\n\nIf you spot something that you think is fake, don't hesitate to report it, she added.\n\nGonzalez also said social media users should be mindful to provide constructive opinions, rather than letting their emotions get the better of them and bash others.\n\nSecond, Gonzalez advocates sharing insightful stories, or stories that are not only true, but can also inspire or otherwise provoke meaningful thinking.\n\nBy focusing on providing an avenue for insight, you offer value in your posts online.\n\nThird, she says people shouldn't post just because they know it will get likes.\n\nIn the grander scheme of things, Gonzalez reminds the audience they shouldn't be obsessed with virtual likes. Instead, by posting a mix of things in your life – those that you're excited about – you can engage people in an authentic way and in a manner that doesn't focus on people liking your posts.\n\nHer fourth piece of advice is to keep one's feelings in check. By this, Gonzalez wants users to be in touch with their feelings, and to realize that constantly comparing one's life to others online will not be productive.\n\nInstead, she pointed out, social media users can step back if the stress of being online is a bit",

The activity was intended to show sympathy for victims of the administration's bloody war on drugs.\n\nThe Ateneo gathering was just one of the many pocket rallies triggered by the death of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in a police operation in Caloocan City.

He pulled out of several international agreements: on climate, free trade, immigration, and Unesco.\n\nSuspicions of collusion between his election campaign and Russia, however, dogged the start of his term.\n\nOn December 6, in another break with his predecessors, Trump created shockwaves around the world when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nNorth Korea's sprint toward full-fledged nuclear statehood accelerated sharply in 2017.

This initiative, often called “RevGov,” is intended to give Mr Duterte the power and authority to act swiftly and without impediment to address the problems brought about by crime, corruption, non-inclusive growth, and issues that stem from the 1987 Constitution.\n\nProponents of RevGov have argued that the Constitution is holding the President back from enacting what they claim to be the will of the people. Hence, by setting the Constitution aside through “revolution,” Mr. Duterte would finally be unfettered and free to carry out his vision.\n\nThe frustration is understandable. Despite widespread popularity and a position of patronage vis-à-vis his allies in government, Mr. Duterte has nevertheless found his ability to rapidly carry out a broad agenda stymied. The main reason for this is that, despite the vast power that he wields, the president of the Philippines is not an absolute ruler. The president cannot act without Congress, Congress cannot execute things on its own, and actions of either are subject to the review of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, the system of checks and balances forces leaders into a paradigm of constant deliberation and consensus-building, with any consensus subject to possible tests of constitutionality. Thus, there can be no rapid, sweeping changes, regardless of administration, because the system of government under the Constitution is not designed to work that way. The theory behind this is that slow, deliberate action, developed through cooperation, is preferable to any one man or small group of men calling the shots.\n\nWe’ve seen what happens when one-man rule occurs.

Respondent Maninang introduced himself as the owner and was asked to open the truck. The police saw 60 boxes of assorted cigarette products of Marlboro and Philip Morris which were all wrapped in sacks.\n\nSuspicious of its contents, the police reported their discovery and requested assistance from the BIR to validate the authenticity of the stamps in the cigarettes.\n\nA total of 82 master cases and 49 reams of assorted cigarette products including Marlboro, Philip Morris, Fortune Tobacco, Mighty, Jackpot cigarettes were tested using two Taggant readers. Results of the Taggant reading recorded the stamps as invalid. No valid internal revenue stamps were found on the packs of cigarettes tested. The four-day testing showed that all the stamps were fake, according to the BIR.\n\nManinang, according to BIR, did not declare or register the said business with BIR. As a result, he failed to pay the annual registration fee according to the BIR.\n\n“He was also not given authority to print receipts for his undertakings. As such, the receipts being used and issued by him in connection with the sale of the cigarettes were considered unregistered receipts,” the BIR said.\n\nThe BIR said that Maninang evaded the payment of correct taxes amounting to a total deficiency of P12,447,000 inclusive of increments.\n\nThe case against Maninang is the 110th filed under the Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) program of the BIR and also a RATE case of Revenue Region No. 4.",

So hindi lang San Fernando pero iniisip din natin ang mga kapitbahay nating mga bayan,” he said.\n\nSecond, Santiago stressed the need to boost tourism in the city as more investors are coming in.\n\n“We will have to work on a kind of tourism that is really vibrant at hindi iyung overnight lang. With more investors coming in, we need to boost tourism, eco-tourism at that, which will not harm the environment and will spur economic activity.

Search “holiday makeup look” on YouTube for inspiration, though, and find that pretty much everyone goes for a red lip this time of year. While that’s a timeless look, here are some ideas to try if you want to go for something a little more unique. Inspiration is everywhere!\n\nRed and green are on wreaths, poinsettias, and just about anywhere you’ll look this time of year. If red lips aren’t your thing, why not try green on the eyes? I hardly see people wearing green eyeshadow, but I think a deeper emerald green or forest green is super wearable when blended with trusty neutrals. If you’re not ready to go full-on green-eyed, a smudge of dark green eyeliner will have people looking twice (in a good way), trying to figure out what you’ve done differently to enhance your eyes.\n\nIt’s Christmas time in the city, and most ladies are sporting red manicures. Take inspiration from snow and frost (which would be nice in this heatwave) with a white and silver mani. How nicely would that pop while your hands are unwrapping red holiday ribbons?\n\nWhat goes with frankincense and myrrh, and with all your holiday outfits, too? A simple gold headband will look pretty to enhance any hair color or style, whether hair is up or down, or whether you’re heading out for day or night.",

LTO’s Francis Almora, director for law enforcement service, said drivers involved in incidents like road rage will receive a 10-point demerit, which would result in a shorter license validity or even suspension.\n\nIn my book, the LTO should not just implement a point system to road rage violators but especially to people who park illegally in our streets. But the better system is for the LTO to put CCTVs on major intersections and bill the offender when he renews his driver’s license.

Qualified theft is a bailable offense, and those who offered to pay for the corned beef “a hundred times over” should have just shouldered his bail of P2,000 ASAP.\n\nInstead the clerk spent several days in a Manila jail before his mother managed to raise the cash and bail him out.\n\nThe public pity is valid; the world’s Jean Valjeans, not his pursuer Inspector Javert, get the sympathy. And the sentiments amplified at the start of this article are even more valid. Why did the store clerk land in jail, while Imelda Marcos is in Congress? Why are the crooks who inflicted on us the disaster that is the Metro Rail Transit 3 enjoying a merry Christmas, while the store clerk, whose name in the age of Google will always be associated with stealing from his employer, is facing an uncertain future?\n\nQualified theft is a felony, and it doesn’t exempt the poor or the hungry. There are many poor and hungry people who don’t resort to stealing.\n\nThat supermarket chain is too big to ignore wage rates set by law, so the clerk couldn’t have been as penniless as he painted himself to be, or so famished he would hide a can of corned beef in his store apron to eat… when and where? In the employees’ toilet? He would have had to open the can in front of coworkers in the employees’ canteen, and then cook the corned beef unless he’s willing to risk botulism.\n\nStill, his story inevitably generat",

So should be the thinking and action of the security brass.\n\nCompassion prevailed. Despite his anger with local communist rebels for ambushing soldiers on humanitarian mission, President Rody Duterte unilaterally declared Christmas truce with them. Their sneak attack on troops rescuing landslide victims in Northern Samar mimicked their massacre years ago of soldiers rushing food to flooded Bulacan villagers. Similar assaults on unarmed soldiers marketing for food and on security guards of agribusinesses earlier prompted Duterte to halt peace talks. He also began the process of classifying them as terrorists, to foil their financiers. Riskily that could antagonize mere political dissenters and so fuel the rebel propaganda. With the 1992 repeal of the Anti-Subversion Law, it is no longer a crime to espouse communism, only to take up arms against the state. Perhaps the Christmas ceasefire would give political leaders time to reflect on that.\n\nBackchannels reportedly are still open between government and rebel negotiators.

Because of their rubber soles, this kind of footwear allows the wearer to walk silently, being able to “sneak” around unnoticed.\n\nExtreme sneaker collectors are called sneakerheads and it is not uncommon for them to own at least 300 pairs of shoe models of different variations.   Per se, collecting is a great hobby and unless that hobby does not contradict the norms of society, there’s nothing wrong with it.

Similar fears were raised when President Duterte declared martial law all over Mindanao for the first time in May as Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists inspired by the Islamic State laid siege to Marawi. The same fears were raised when the original 60-day period lapsed and Congress agreed to extend martial law until the end of this year.\n\nThat the government managed to allay the fears was due in large part to the way the Armed Forces of the Philippines conducted the war in Marawi. The AFP convinced a jittery nation that it is not dictator Ferdinand Marcos’ military, and that it will stand in the way of attempts to use military rule for purposes other than defense against enemies of the state. School children wrote letters of support to soldiers in the frontlines.

Gilas head coach Chot Reyes recently said Tratter is a candidate for the Gilas pool. Tratter confirmed that he’s been asked to try out by agents linked to Gilas.\n\n“When I came over to play for La Salle, one of the first things I did was to buy a Gilas jersey,” he said. “I remember writing my name at the back of the jersey, thinking how special it would be to play for the country. It would make my mom really proud. That’s my dream, to play for Gilas. I’m fortunate that I played four years at La Salle, winning a championship once. Now, it’s time to move on.”\n\nTratter, who turns 25 on Jan. 9, was picked on the fourth round by Marinerong Pilipino in the recent PBA D-League draft. Before leaving to spend the holidays with family in Milpitas, California, the other day, he was with Marinero coach Koy Banal for four practices. Some of his Marinero teammates are former UAAP adversaries Vince Tolentino and Gboy Babilonia of Ateneo and Alvin Pasaol of UE. Tratter said he’ll be back on Jan. 7 to resume workouts with Marinero. He’ll be lined up by La Salle to play in the PCCL National Collegiate Championships on Feb. 2-11.\n\nBefore playing for La Salle, Tratter was with the St. Francis High School basketball and track varsities in Mountain View, California then suited up a year at DeAnza College in Cupertino, also in California. The year at DeAnza was counted against his five years of UAAP eligibility so he played only four seasons at La Salle.\n\n“I’ve got a year and a half left to earn my degree in psychology,” said Tratter. “That’s 70 units.

Except that’s probably what it felt like for Ebenezer Scrooge; but instead of distant relatives, they were ghosts.\n\nBut really, Christmas can be a pretty dark time. It’s a season of in-your-face togetherness. We’re forced to resolve conflict and rebuild bonds amongst ourselves. Practically a big despidida for the past year, we unwillingly fall into a state of retrospection. We’re faced with the big question humankind has been asking itself since the conception of Christmas itself: Have we been naughty or nice? (And we don’t always like the answer, do we?)\n\nThis year’s A Christmas Carol toys with these more nightmarish aspects of Christmas. Although it begins with giddy, uplifting production numbers like Jolly, Rich and Fat, it quickly spirals into the dark but kooky Link by Link à la The Nightmare Before Christmas until finally, it dives headlong into the haunting visit by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be in Dancing on Your Grave. The extra grit is thoroughly enjoyable, and a much welcome shade to the classic production.\n\nMiguel Faustman is riveting as Scrooge. During the intermission, I heard a mom tell her kid: “Scrooge is the bad guy.” But with Faustman’s portrayal, that’s really not a judgment that crosses your mind. Faustman’s Scrooge is, well, Scroogey in every sense but you forget that the moment you witness just how much life has broken him. How can you give when so much has been taken from you? Ultimately, A Christmas Carol is about how it’s never too late for a broken soul to heal. Faustman is deeply affecting, and I highly doubt I’ll ever see a better Scrooge. Apart from Faustman, the show is further bolstered by top-class performances by veterans Noel Rayos as Jacob Marley/Mr. Fezziwig and Franco Laurel as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Rissey Reyes is also stunning in her wordless haunting of Ebenezer. Over",

It is to the AFP’s credit that opposition to the extension, overwhelmingly ratified by the pro-administration super majority in Congress, has been generally subdued. It is also to the credit of this AFP that people perceive martial law in the Duterte administration to be different from military rule during Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship.\n\nPublic trust, however, must be nurtured. The perception that the AFP can be trusted with immense martial law powers can vanish overnight. In recent weeks, complaints have emerged, accusing the AFP of human rights violations in fighting the Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists who laid siege to Marawi for five months. So far, however, the AFP is generally seen to have accomplished its mission in Marawi. The AFP lost scores of its members in driving out the terrorists and killing their top commanders. The military victory allowed residents to return to their homes for the difficult task of rebuilding a ruined city.\n\nThe one-year extension will still be challenged before the courts. But its implementation starts on the first day of the new year, and the AFP must show that it can sustain its conduct in Marawi in the continued fight against Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Communist rebels have been added to the targets of martial law, which could alter perceptions of the way the battle is carried out.\n\nAfter President Duterte declared Marawi “liberated” from the IS-Maute threat, soldiers returning from the battle received a hero’s welcome. This was a big cause for celebration yesterday at the 82nd anniversary of the Armed Forces. As the AFP looks forward to another year, its members must not lose public trust. Remembering their anniversary theme would be useful: “protecting the people, securing the state.”",

Residents in the hardest hit community in Biliran, where a landslide buried alive over 20 persons including children, said they did not feel at risk because the mountain slope behind them had not been denuded.\n\nIncessant rains over the weekend, however, loosened the soil enough to unleash an avalanche of mud, trees and boulders from the slopes down to the community at the foot of the mountain. Members of the disaster coordinating committee said the area had long been identified as a risk zone.\n\nThe grievous toll from a tropical storm should spur better coordination among disaster officials and the communities that sprout in risk areas. There are people who ignore disaster risk warnings, but it’s not impossible to get them out of harm’s way when the risk is heightened by a weather disturbance. Barangay officials in particular are supposed to be familiar with communities in their jurisdiction and should know enough about weather disturbances in this country to provide timely warning about potential mudslides.\n\nThere have been deadly mudslides in recent years to give urgency to such warnings. In February 2006, also following about 10 days of incessant rains, a mild earthquake of magnitude 2.6 unleashed a landslide that buried the entire village of Guinsaugon in the town of Saint Bernard in Southern Leyte.

It will take effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the TRAIN, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAbout 70 percent of revenues from the TRAIN will be used to bankroll the Duterte administration’s ambitious infrastructure drive.\n\nThe Department of Finance earlier said the new excise tax system for automobiles was not just a revenue-enhancing measure but also a way to address pollution and congestion. According to a survey done by the DOF, 80 percent of families in the Philippines do not own cars.\n\nTo encourage cleaner transportation, electric vehicles are exempt while hybrid cars will be taxed at half rates. Meanwhile, pick-ups, which are commonly used by businessmen and entrepreneurs for commercial and agricultural purposes, are excluded as well.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of tax rates adjustments for cars under TRAIN:\n\nThe DOF earlier flagged what it called “misleading social media and news reports” on the price increase of cars under TRAIN, and assured the public that there would be “no doubling of car prices” as the tax hike would be “moderate, not extreme.”\n\nThe DOF likewise pointed out that with the substantial cuts in personal income tax rates, “Filipinos would have more money in their pockets, making entry-level cars more affordable for them.”\n\n“The tax base is not the retail price but the manufacturing or importation p",

While the celebration has been commercialized and somewhat adulterated by many other practices, it is still most appropriate and necessary event for all of us to commemorate because it is the greatest manifestation of God’s immeasurable love for us by sending His only begotten Son in the form of human flesh and blood to suffer and die so that we may regain the life of eternal bliss.\n\nLately, questions and doubts have been raised regarding some details of the event particularly the exact date when Christ was born. Skeptics say that there is no Biblical basis for fixing December 25 as Christmas day and that this is just a pagan invention. This aspect is not so important however. Most important is the Biblical fact that Christ is born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem. We just have to focus on this infallible truth so that we can experience true Christmas joy.\n\nAdmittedly, the joy of the occasion has not yet sunk deep nor has it been truly felt by most of us because of the series of devastations in our country particular the recent landslide in Biliran Leyte that caused the loss of so many lives and enormous damage to property. It is really hard to have a “Merry Christmas” with the thought that most of our countrymen in that part of our land suffer not only the tragic loss of lives and property but also the harshness of living in poverty and want. At this time, what we can do is to pray that God help them and care for them in their hour of misery.\n\nBut real joy may also be still eluding us simply because we look at the occasion from its purely materialistic aspect brought about by too much commercialism which in turn has even caused heavier traffic. We are now more influenced by the modern ways of celebrating the event where Santa Claus and his reindeers have replaced the Belen or the Nativity Scene as the more popular Christmas décor; w",

For the unacquainted, he’s an 18-year-old internet star and rapper born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. He was once known as “that dude wearing a pink polo shirt and a fanny pack” thanks to his self-produced music video for Dat $tick. After just over a year, that same video has over 79 million views on YouTube. These days, he’s busy working on his debut album (dropping Feb. 2, 2018), touring with the other artists under the music collective 88Rising, and yes, still killing it on Twitter. Oh, he’s also part of Rolling Stone’s recent “25 Under 25” list too. (Yes, big deal.)\n\nSpeaking of tours, the inaugural 88Rising Asia Tour recently concluded in Jakarta, Chigga’s hometown. He stopped by Manila a few days before that, and performed alongside lo-fi hip-hop artist Joji and Chinese rap quartet Higher Brothers who weren’t initially part of the Manila lineup. House Manila in Remington Hotel was packed with all kinds of people. Think: your typical fuccboi squad, local artists keeping it low-key in the VIP lounge, and even your classic titos and titas rich enough to “check out the scene” on a whim. I won’t say I’m a big hip-hop fan. I don’t “spit bars” and “turn tf up,” but it’s easy to fall in love with a damn good song, artists with great personality, and a community that has so much color. And that’s exactly why I was so excited for their show last Dec. 13.\n\n88Rising artists didn’t hit the stage ’til a few minutes before midnight, but the trip started as soon as we pulled up at House Manila. People’s fashion statements alone already screamed that the crowd for the night was crazy fun, and yes, they did come through. There was even a point when someone randomly shouted “people are sending stupid sh*t on AirDrop” and best believe my friends and I turned ours on.

Thereafter, export growth is expected to be maintained at nine percent from 2020 to 2022.\n\n“This is consistent with the observation that global trade is picking up, so we adjusted our exports (assumptions),” Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, who heads the DBCC, had said then.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country’s total export sales in October rose 6.6 percent to $5.37 billion from $5.04 billion in the same month last year. This marked the 11th consecutive month of positive growth in exports.\n\nHowever, imports still continued to outpace exports, amounting to $8.21 billion, or 13.1 percent up from $7.26 billion the previous year.\n\nThis resulted in a trade deficit of $2.84 billion in October, higher than the $2.22 billion deficit in October last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Beltran expects other macroeconomic assumptions of the DBCC to improve after its meeting today. However, he declined to name which indicators and projections would be changed.\n\n“It will be announced later depending on their decision but all are improvements over the previous (assumptions),” Beltran said.\n\nMeanwhile, Diokno said in a separate interview other agenda in today’s meeting include the review of the government’s 2017 performance, discussion of the Tax Reform for Accele",

Things do not always seem the same thing to different people. Anyway, the tax reform law made many people happy with its substantial reduction in income taxes, but the trade-off consisting of hefty taxes elsewhere also made a lot of others apprehensive.\n\nBut here is where the new law might emerge in a positive light amid the overall scheme of things: Whether we like it or not, whether there is a new tax reform law that reduces income taxes or not, prices in virtually everything will always be going up. From oil products to sweetened drinks to brand new cars –there is not going to be any relief from the relentless assault of escalating prices.\n\nThese continuously soaring prices can come as a huge tidal wave, as feared by many as a consequence of the reduction in income taxes, or as slight but steady add-ons that a people rendered numb and callous by their inexorable certainty may not readily notice until the reality hits them when they get their bills. But as sure as the sun rises in the east, the increases will come to everything that people cannot do without.\n\nAnd so, to the ever practical Filipino, the situation is ultimately made very clear. Given the absolute certainty of price increases in absolutely everything, would he still rather be given some relief in his income taxes or not? The obvious answer is of course, as Cebuanos would say in their very precise language –maayo na lang.\n\nWhether there is a tax break or not, prices will still always increase. So “maayo na lang” that there is a tax break. Or as Cebuanos are bound to add: “Ha-i labi og wala.” It is therefore always better to consider things in their broader perspective.\n\nIt is always better to weigh the pros and cons. But more importantly, it is always better to maintain a little bias toward the positive.\n\nFor there is no gov",

It takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the fresh law, personal income tax rates will be reduced while projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nAccording to the DOF, the first tax reform package was “designated to shift the tax burden from the lower 99 percent of the community to the wealthiest 1 percent.”\n\nIt would also end the country’s complex tax system that has become vulnerable to evasion and leakages by transforming it into a “simple, just and efficient” structure, the DOF added.\n\nBut before this major victory of the Duterte government, the bill, according to the president himself, had met “rough sailing” before it reached his desk. Despite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s tax reform program had encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nSome sectors also warned that imposing higher excise taxes on cars, coal, fuel, mining, among others, could hurt the robust growth of certain industries.\n\nIn that regard, is the TRAIN law really a boon or a bane for both rich and poor Filipinos?\n\nIn an opinion piece published on BusinessWorld on December 19, Raymond Abrea,",

Here the ‘ber’ months are typically used to refer to one of the longest holiday seasons in the world.\n\nAs early as September, Christmas songs start playing on radio stations and marketers launch holiday deals and promos, all with the intent of getting consumers in the mood to buy gifts, plan trips, and celebrate with their families and loved ones.\n\nBut are Filipinos’ shopping habits really aligned with these dates? And with growing concern about heavy traffic and poor public transportation in Metro Manila, how much shopping will be done online, and on which platforms? To find answers, Nerve, ’s data research arm, recently conducted a survey among our readers.\n\nRespondents were mostly millennials (aged 18-35) as well as adults aged 36 and up. The survey was served to visitors of the  site from September 12 to 18. Majority (70%) of respondents hailed from the Philippines. There were slightly more female respondents (54%) than men (46%).\n\nThe survey's margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points, with a 99% level of confidence. The poll sheds light on the new shopping habits of a modern, digitally-savvy market.\n\nThough many retailers begin their Christmas campaigns in September, consumers aren’t making the bulk of their purchases that early.\n\nAmong respondents, 55% indicated that December is the heaviest shopping month, with November coming in second at 24%. Only 5% of respondents said they shop in either September or October.\n\nThis means that early marketing and in-store retailing efforts spent on Christmas may largely be wasted. The classic marketer’s dilemma of “Right Message, Right Person, Right Time” is likely missing the time target.\n\nNovember and December would be the best months to launch a holiday-themed campaign.

According to the Celtics page in the NBA website, Olynyk was chosen for the award “in celebration of the incredible impact that he had on the local community as an active, off-court citizen.” Usually, the team gives this award during timeouts to ordinary citizens who have gone above and beyond in service to the city.\n\n“I love this community and just everything the Celtics did,” Olynyk said Wednesday afternoon following Heat shootaround. “It was just fun, you know; fun to get out there with the kids, especially.

A championship in the BLIA Cup in Taiwan last August where they faced teams from China, France and the United States was proof.\n\nBut things went downhill since then. A few weeks after winning the title in Taiwan, the Green Archers were at the headlines for the wrong reasons following a bench-clearing brawl against the Far Eastern University Tamaraws in a pre-season game in Davao.\n\nA few weeks passed again and they lost to the University of the Philippines Fighting Maroons, 87-98, midway the first round. To be fair, the Fighting Maroons were highly competitive heading into Season 80 but no one anticipated them to defeat the Green Archers, much more win by double digits.\n\nNow, people had speculations if La Salle was imploding. Then the speculations grew louder after reports surfaced that there was a rift between players and bosses from La Salle were unsatisfied with how head coach Aldin Ayo handled his wards.\n\n“We were not able to handle very well our championship last season. I don’t want to expound on that. Medyo maselan eh. We were not able to handle really well our championship. Worried ako how we started our season.

She claims that her husband “might” have amassed nearly P1 billion worth of ill-gotten wealth. Few hours after, on the front page of the Philippine Daily Inquirer ran the headline “Wife says poll chief has ill-gotten wealth,” shocking the nation.\n\nWhile it started as another high-profile marital trouble, sometime after, administration-linked bloggers started connecting it with the 2016 national elections, and claiming that Chairman Bautista’s unexplained wealth was proof that the recent elections had been rigged to favor certain candidates for national posts.\n\nSuspended lawyer and now blogger Trixie Angeles highlighted that Patricia’s counsel mentioned that “Chairman Bautista has links with Smartmatic and personally met with them in Washington, DC.” Another blogger RJ Nieto of Thinking Pinoy came up with a little more complex explanation, linking Chairman Bautista to Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party.

[Where are we eating?]”\n\nWe ask this question everyday. Sometimes during breakfast, most of the time during lunch at work, and often during dinner dates with our friends or significant other.\n\nAsking more questions helps us decide: “Is this what I’m craving for? Does this restaurant have good reviews? Is the food any good? Is it affordable?”\n\nBut besides the taste or customer rating of a restaurant, there are more important questions we should be asking about the food that we’re putting inside our bodies.\n\nOn our first ever #WhatsNext farm-to-table cooking workshop last December 9, our friends from Holy Carabao Holistic Farms taught us how to cook and eat better by asking five simple questions about the food we consume.\n\nFor Hindy Weber and Melanie Teng-Go, our program leaders, and founders of Holy Carabao, these are also the foundations on how they approach their business. “A sustainable business considers not just the product but as well as the planet and the people,” said Hindy.\n\n“We should recognize what’s on our plate,” said Melanie.\n\nA tinola may sound like a simple, healthy enough dish. But do you know what kind of water was used to make the broth? Was the soup made with artificial flavorings?

And the heavy traffic and packed trains during your commute leave you with no energy to cook your own meals. But it’s still best to keep dining out to a minimum.\n\n“Even if it’s not organic, if it’s cooked by your mom in the kitchen, it’s still healthier than what you buy commercially,” said Melanie.\n\nA healthy meal doesn’t have to be prepared us",

I’ve done it with San Beda after a 28-year title drought,” said Banal, a former UAAP and NCAA champion head coach. “I know what to do and how to do it.”\n\nIf hired, Banal’s entry to UE gives not one, but two benefits to the struggling program. One, his championship mettle may be key to reviving UE’s championship pedigree. After all, UE is still tied with the University of Santo Tomas (UST) for the second-most UAAP men’s basketball championships at 18.\n\nTwo, as current Marinerong Pilipino head coach, Banal will get to spend time with prized UE star and Marinerong Pilipino’s 19th overall pick Alvin Pasaol, who has remained silent on whether he’ll return to the team after Derrick Pumaren resigned. Pasaol has formed a father-and-son-like bond with Pumaren, and Banal’s interaction with him will likely influence his decision to stay.\n\nBanal had led a young Arwind Santos to a title with Far Eastern University (FEU) in 2003 and received another in 2004 after De La Salle University (DLSU) was stripped of the honor due to a player eligibility scandal. He then led San Beda College in the NCAA to a title in his first full season in 2006, ending their drought.

A child’s relationships and values will be shaped by the most important adult of his growing up years.\n\nOnce a child starts to explore and discover their own interests and passions, parents must encourage their children to learn beyond the fundamentals – by allowing them to expand their horizons on their own.\n\nSocial interaction is important for a child’s learning process.

Drag the arrows left to right of the images below:\n\n1. Discovering sense of self – More questions about oneself\n\nSocialization is proven to encourage learning among younger children.

Here, a parent’s role is crucial. They can answer children’s questions and support them in their interests to further hone their skills, which can prove useful in their adult life.\n\nBringing a child into an uncontrolled environment can be worrisome for parents. During playdates, for example, a child will be exposed to many different people and an entirely new space. Parents will not be able to control what their children touch, eat, or interact with.\n\nLetting go is part of every parent’s journey.

(READ: Christmas, parol makers, just around the corner)\n\n\"Parang hindi ako makatulog o balisa ako 'pag hindi ako gumawa ng parol. Parang napapanaginip ko 'yung Star of Bethlehem,\" he told .

According to him, his family has been in the business of making parols since then. (READ: PH X'mas symbols, practices trace roots to Spanish era)\n\nQuiwa said that nobody taught him how to make parols.

But every tough-talking man meets his match in an independent woman. Make that two independent women.\n\n2017 saw Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales standing up to the President on different occasions and different issues.\n\nWhile Morales occasionally toned down her jabs against Duterte, Sereno was consistently bold at every chance.\n\nHere’s a look at the times they addressed the Chief Executive.\n\nDuterte’s first 6 months as president was marked by an international scrutiny of his ruthless war on drugs, already killing thousands at the time.\n\nMorales, in December 2016, was soft on the President, saying in an Inquirer forum that Duterte’s public threats to criminals were just words. \"It's not illegal to say, 'I will kill you,'\" she said.\n\nSereno was a little bit more critical. In January 2017, she announced that the Philippines dropped 19 places in the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, and blamed it on the extrajudicial killings.\n\n\"Despite all of these positive things and even greater potential gains, we have to face the reality of the daily accounts of unsolved killings, many of them committed brazenly with public warnings against drug pushing or addiction,” Sereno said without directly mentioning Duterte.\n\nThe Chief Justice stepped it up in March, calling on lawyers during the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) convention to help address the “creeping impunity.”\n\n“In the face of clear and patent injustices, we have an affirmative duty to not turn a blind eye but to do what we can to help,” Sereno said.\n\nAnd when the President proclaimed martial law in Mindanao in May, Sereno stood up before graduates of the Ateneo de Manila University and warned that military rule could be used to oppress the people.\n\n“Suffice it to say that the martial law",

Most of them belong to families who could barely afford 3 meals a day, much less a proper burial.\n\nIt was close to midnight when Flor tracked down her nephew, Alex, and Michelle her son, Mark, but they couldn't take them. Light Funeral Service demanded P35,000 ($690)* to claim each body.\n\nEarlier in the day, the women set out to search for the boys they held just the day before. Later on, they learned that the celebration their children attended the past night had turned into a bloodbath.\n\nJohn, Mark, and Alex along with two others, were celebrating John’s 38th birthday when a knock on the door led to gunshots that left all 5 men dead in Barangay Payatas, Quezon City, on August 15, 2016.\n\nMay*, John’s wife, said she was lucky she reached her husband’s body at the morgue.

He did not have a vice president then, as the 1943 Constitution abolished the position and vested executive power solely in the president. The position was left vacant from August 1944 to May 1946.\n\nThe amended 1935 Constitution – paving the return of the vice president in the executive department – was reestablished with the restoration of the Commonwealth government on February 27, 1945.

Quirino did not have a vice president from 1948 to 1949, as the amended 1935 Constitution, which was still in effect then, did not have provisions on what would happen in case of a vacancy in the office of the vice president.\n\n",

Posetti has been studying harassment of journalists in the digital space since 2011.\n\nShe authored the UNESCO study, \"Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age,\" which sought to encourage journalists to train themselves on digital security, educate the public, and advocate for institutional reforms to protect journalists and their sources.\n\nThe massive study, which covered media trends in 121 countries, showed increasing threats to investigative journalism as new laws and technologies make it more difficult for journalists to protect the identity of sources.\n\nCyberharassment is usually gendered, says Posetti. She described attacks against women journalists as often sexualized and intimate – preying on women's race, physical appearance, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and family members.\n\n“It can involve images that are designed to confront, images of decapitated bodies, of women being raped, or images of an individual journalist altered into a meme,” Posetti said.\n\nThese attacks, she said, are intended to create fear, tarnish the credibility, and cause the retreat of women journalists who were writing investigative reports or critiques of personalities or institutions.\n\nDuring her talk, Posetti shared anecdotes of women reporters who were called words like 'slut', 'bitch', or 'presstitute'.

He saved 15 of his men from certain death, a remarkable achievement that earned him a nomination to receive the Medal of Valor, the highest combat award.\n\nWAR DURING RAMADAN. Marawi is notorious for loose firearms. Many ignored the first gunshots, dismissing them as part of clan wars that would end as abruptly as they started. They were wrong.\n\nISIS IN THE PHILIPPINES.

This also encouraged the owners to explore more ways of preserving and processing the harvested mushrooms.\n\nLilet’s now offers a wide array of processed mushroom products, from dried mushrooms, lumpia mushrooms, and pickled mushrooms, to mushroom siomai and sweetened mushrooms. The products are sold all over Region 6.\n\nLocated just beside the Antique Provincial Capitol, Lilet’s has a pop-up kiosk where they sell their products. You can try their mushroom burger and mushroom chicharon for a healthy snack while enjoying the al fresco set-up.\n\nTheir double-patty mushroom burger costs P85 while the single patty goes for P65. You can also buy their crunchy chicharon (P50), which is best partnered with their spicy sinamak.\n\nThe Palaro heat is on, and with local temperatures soaring high, no food is as comforting as a cone of homemade ice cream.\n\nLeo’s Homemade Ice Cream has been one of Antique’s favorite ice cream parlors for over 4 years now.\n\nEach ice cream flavor is crafted with locally sourced fruits a",

From smartphones to virtual assistants to virtual reality, innovations continue to come in the form of new physical designs such as we've seen with Apple's iPhone – arguably the most hyped phone of the year.\n\nAlong with this, we saw the continued push for new consumer-facing technologies such as augmented reality, cryptocurrencies, and AI-focused chips such as the ones found in new Huawei flagship phones. In no particular order, here's what we witnessed in 2017 from the world of consumer tech:\n\nApple’s 10th anniversary phone, the iPhone X, was clearly the most anticipated handset of the year. The media frenzy following the announcement in September was one for the books, which had top tech global websites jostling for a leak and paying top dollar for prior information, even betting on how it was going to be named.\n\nThe hysteria was somewhat doused when it was finally revealed that the brand new iPhone would sell for way over a thousand dollars, the most expensive smartphone ever. In the Philippines, the iconic phone is selling for approximately P64,000 plus, with variations in installment and incentive pricing from Smart and Globe.\n\nThis is also not to forget that Apple has another advanced smartphone in the running, the iPhone 8, although most of the attention truly had been sopped up by the X.\n\nThe silver lining in the iPhone X cloud is that it gave competitors a wide enough room to wiggle in and compete aggressively specs for specs and a share of consumer’s wallet. Samsung, which got toasted in 2016 with the global recall of its burning flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7, rebounded this year with a brand new smartphone, the Galaxy Note 8.\n\nEarlier in the year, we also saw the Galaxy S8 and a",

For over 2 million Pinoys working abroad and their loved ones, it is doubly significant, as the month is also Overseas Filipino Worker Awareness Month.\n\nThis year, to commemorate the occasion, Bench, the Philippines’ premier lifestyle brand, has launched “Anak.\" It is an online film paying tribute to our OFW’s, starring those most dear to them – their children. In line with their #LoveLocal advocacy, Bench brought together participants from fourteen countries across four continents to create a version of Freddie Aguilar’s timeless song unlike anything seen or heard before.\n\nCrafted from the performances of sixteen children of OFWs, “Bench - Anak” weaves together multiple languages and dialects to reflect the multinational upbringings experienced by many Filipino families. Among the performers are Bench endorsers Rocco Nacino and Max Collins, who know all too well what it’s like to have parents willing to sacrifice everything to provide for their loved ones.\n\n“As a kid, siyempre hindi ko pa naiintindihan lahat. Ba’t kailangan mo umalis dito,” says Nacino, who grew up in the Philippines while his father worked as an engineer in Singapore. As for Collins, who was able to live with her mother who worked as a store manager in Vallejo, Califarnia, the situation was no less difficult, as she grew up as an outsider for most of her life. Fortunately, the strength and support of her mother saw them through: “My mom is like my best friend. Siya yung tumayong nanay at tatay ko,” says Collins.\n\nFrom endorsers to regular citizens, “Bench-Anak” is a testament to the deep love and bonds that can exist between children and their parents.

Despite his dominance against Calacar (3-2-6, 1 KO), a former amateur teammate of Barriga's from Davao del Sur, Barriga was content to potshot and move after a punishing first round, never pushing his advantage or pursuing a knockout.\n\nWhat Barriga did show was that he'd been studying the moves of Vasyl Lomachenko, stepping behind his opponent when he tried to hold, and landing cleanly with his back hand as a lead ala Floyd Mayweather.\n\n\"He's a good boxer, sometimes you have a fighter or opponent, he knows what is your style, he studies you,\" said Barriga, 24, of his opponent. \"Sometimes he checked my style, that's why sometimes it's so hard to get him.\"\n\nMP Promotions matchmaker Sean Gibbons, who was in town to announce the next title defense for IBF junior bantamweight champ Jerwin Ancajas earlier in the day, said he sees the case to fast-track Barriga into the world title picture due to his extensive amateur background and experience as a 2012 Olympian.\n\n\"I could see him absolutely fighting early next year for an IBF eliminator or WBO, and then potentially a world title by the end of the year,\" said Gibbons. Barriga is ranked number 5 by the IBF at 105 pounds, where the champion is Hiroto Kyoguchi of Japan, while Japan's Ryuya Yamanaka holds the title with the WBO, where Barriga is ranked number 6.\n\nThe fight was Barriga's fifth of 2017, and first since he outclassed two-time world title challenger Samartlek Kokietgym in Beiji",

Occasionally, he also shares Bible verses, online quizzes, funny internet memes, and random videos.\n\nAside from his usual posts on politics, Yasay also continues to support Duterte – from the impeachment case filed against him, to his decision to declare martial law in Mindanao.

There had been two previous failed attempts by the military.\n\nSandoval and his men were determined to take it that day.

According to these reports, agencies owned by foreign entities used by illegal agents are paid $500 for every applicant they are able to bring in. Women from Mindanao comprise most of the victims of the scheme. (READ: 'Slow' gov't process makes OFWs fall for illegal recruiters)\n\nAccording to Geslani, the backers are mostly from the Middle East, some of whom are married to Filipino women to be able to conduct their business in the Philippines.\n\nDOLE is currently conducting an internal cleansing and investigation of the irregularities inside POEA after they received continuous reports of illegal recruitment with some of their employees earning as much as P250,000 from it.\n\nThis has prompted DOLE to suspend the processing of overseas employment certificate for two weeks in November.\n\nPOEA officer-in-charge and labor undersecretary Bernard Olalia said that this recent claim is another matter that they may separately investigate.\n\nDeployment of HSWs continues after it saw a steep rise of 70% in 2016.

Lee Van Corteza snapped off the 14.1 (Straight Pool) World Tournament last October, which is not officially a WPA-sanctioned event but might as well be due to the strength of the field.\n\nBiado's triumph caps a banner year for the La Union-born, QC raised 34-year old.

The main reason for the salection of PCMC as implementor was directly attributable to the late issuance of the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO), an authority to incur obligations, and the Department of Health (DOH) practice of sub-allotting funds to government medical centers to procure items for the department’s central office.\n\nSecond, when one plans for a new, big health project, the primary consideration is achieving the “highest chance of success.” If the target individuals were Grade 4 school children and the vaccination sites wo",

Strong winds and large waves started to lash it about two hours into the trip, he said.\n\n\"The vessel came to a halt and started taking in water in the front side. The passengers dashed to one side and the ferry started to sink,\" Mendiola said. He said the passengers were instructed to don life vests.\n\nCoast guard boats, navy vessels and fishing boats rescued 166 people, including many who were floating in the rough sea, Balilo said, adding that the ferry could carry 286 people and apparently wasn't overcrowded.\n\nRescue efforts will continue despite rough waves and nightfall, Balilo said, adding that a coast guard helicopter tried to fly to the area but was hampered by the strong winds.\n\nMany of those rescued were taken to Dinahican village in Infanta, where Quezon officials were transporting clothes, food, water and medicine, Juanito Diaz, who heads Quezon's disaster response agency, said by telephone.\n\nFrequent storms, badly maintained vessels and weak enforcement of safety regulations have been blamed for past accidents at sea in the Philippines, including on Dec. 20, 1987, when the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world's worst peacetime maritime disaster.

Or if government targets a firm and looks for reasons to pin it down, it can pin that firm down. This is because businesses are not perfect, they commit violations at one time or another.\n\nThe city’s demolition team with the “kilometric” name Prevention, Restoration, Order, Beautification Enhancement (Probe) headed by the resurrected Raquel Arce, served the closure order issued by Mayor Tomas Osmeña on Vic Enterprises for various violations including lack of business permits, breaches in traffic rules by its delivery trucks and other vehicles, and even smoke belching.\n\nSome of those violations are being committed by other establishments in the city, as well, but for one reason or another, the mayor has singled out Vic Enterprises, something that the firm will have to endure, much like in the cases of Banco de Oro and Rico’s Lechon. One lesson there is that business establishments, especially those whose owners are not in good graces with the mayor, should straighten out their acts before they become targets as well.\n\nBut it’s not that Vic Enterprises is fighting City Hall. It’s owner, Vicente Ongchanhoi, seems to be willing to talk it out with the mayor and the firm has been adopting mitigating measures. But the mayor refused to ease on his hard stance, which is not wrong. You violate the law, you are punished for it. Yet other considerations may come into play, like the welfare of the firm’s workers.\n\nVic Enterprises has 500 employees who will lose their livelihood for the duration that the firm is closed. Unlike Ongchanhoi, who has money to tide him over difficult times, his workers will find it hard to do so, especially those with families to feed. The earlier that normalcy returns in the firm’s operation, the better, more so because uncertainty is adding to their worries.\n\nThis is something that the firm may have to work on primarily but whi",

This represents a more than 200 percent increase from its initial funding of P100 million,” Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles, House appropriations committee chairman, said yesterday.\n\nHe said the allocation “is a big step toward modernizing our police force.”\n\nThe huge increase, he said, is Congress’ response to the President’s call for the national police force to show heightened transparency in the continuing war against illegal drugs and criminality.\n\nHe added that the mass use of body cameras by law enforcers is a recent trend in various parts of the world.\n\nNograles noted that a majority of large police departments in the United States began using body cams in 2015.\n\n“It’s high-time for our policemen and other law enforcers to be deployed with body cams. President Duterte’s critics have also called for this, and him, he will never shirk from anything that will benefit his countrymen,” he said.\n\nAside from providing the public with more transparency during police operations, the body cams will also serve as a handy tool for the law enforcers themselves, he said.\n\n“The apparatus will help policemen in evidence gathering, documentation and post-operation assessment. There have been reports from body cam-wearing cops overseas that arrested individuals admit to their offense quicker when they realize that their actions were recorded. It makes the job of the police easier,” he said.\n\nNograles also said Congress increased the 2018 budget of the Philippine National Police by P20 billion to P131 billion. This year’s allocation is P111 billion, he said.\n\nOf the increase, P850 million was appropriated among police stations nationwide, ",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines — Financial expert and entrepreneur Francisco Colayco once said, “In starting a business, money is the least of your problems.”\n\nIt’s true. What you really need to harness are the will, courage and determination to take the long road to your entrepreneurial dream. Only when you have all these will you begin looking for capital and investors. And then everything falls into place albeit all the challenges you are sure to face.\n\nSo this 2018, let the year be the birth of your business. Here are six practical and inspirational tips that will get you going:\n\nThose who are passionate about things like cooking, arts and crafts, or traveling are the ones who aspire of earning from their passion.\n\nTurn your passion into a profitable enterprise by determining your unique selling proposition. Will you offer Filipino cuisine promoting healthy lifestyle? Will you produce tote bags made of hand-woven textile from local artisans? Will you bring travelers to off-the-beaten tracks?\n\nPossibilities are boundless, so narrow them down, keep the choices simple but desirable.\n\nBesides finding a unique selling proposition that is you, Forbes.com also suggests to “fill a hole in a certain market or niche.” Create a startup that will solve something that hasn’t been addressed yet instead of selling a product or offering a service that is already out there.\n\nThis way, it will be a lot easier to have a solid customer base.\n\nAccording to Tycoon.ph, a business — big or small — will need a back office composed of accounting, human resources, information technology and administration, to keep workflows running.\n\nDon’t be intimidated with this because it doesn’t necessarily mean hiring people to build a department. Two to five people are good enough in the beginning if you delegate tasks properly.\n\nBetter to get people who are willing to be your partners. If you must, get friends and relatives who are willing to lend their skills and support your dream.\n\nThanks to social media, ",

Ana were found administratively liable for “conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service aggravated by simple misconduct and simple neglect of duty.”\n\nDismissed ERC chairman Jose Salazar was also found liable for the same offense but was only penalized with a fine equivalent to six months worth of his salary. President Duterte fired Salazar in October on corruption allegations.\n\nIn a separate decision also dated Dec. 11, the ombudsman ordered the filing of graft cases against Salazar and the four ERC commissioners on charges that they facilitated the grant of unwarranted benefit, advantage and preference to the 38 private companies, to the prejudice of the government.\n\nThe two ombudsman decisions stemmed from a complaint filed by Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas (APB) Inc. in November 2016.\n\nIn its complaint, the APB questioned the ERC’s postponement of the implementation of the competitive selection process (CSP) rule that was supposed to take effect on Nov. 6, 2015.\n\nThe CSP rule requires electric companies or utilities to hold public bidding in procuring their power supply to ensure reasonable rates for consumers.\n\nThe ruling stated that by “wrongfully denying the consumers the benefit of CSP, and allowing high valued and long-term” power agreements to be finalized without bidding, “respondents failed to do their duty to encourage market development, ensure customer choice, penalize abuse of market power in the restructured electricity industry and enforce the implementing rules and regulat",

Worse, we have seen how victims of these weather events suffer endlessly with the snail-paced rehabilitation efforts by our government, as shown by the Yolanda tragedy where the people affected are either given substandard homes or are still living in subhuman conditions four years after the infamous typhoon struck and despite the downpour of financial assistance.\n\nThe paper entitled: “Blameless in Stratosphere: Carbon Footprint, Manufacturing Growth, and the Fuel Mix Debate in the Philippines,” presented in a Stratbase-ADR Institute roundtable discussion, is able to put in context the Philippines’ contribution to climate change. Essentially, it highlighted that the Philippines has a very small carbon footprint with per capita carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions lower than African countries such as Angola, Congo and Djibouti. Notably, Dr. Raul Fabella, et al. looked at other Asian countries in their respective years of comparable development to 2011 Philippines.\n\nInterestingly, the country’s 0.9 metric tons per capita CO emissions was significantly lower than 1968 Singapore (2.7 metric tons), 1982 South Korea (3.6 metric tons) and 2004 China (4.1 metric tons). In this comparison, the Philippines, at 2011 development level, was closest to 1991 Thailand and 2008 Indonesia, both at 1.8 metric tons of per capita CO emissions. With such a small carbon footprint, the Philippines is said to have remarkably outweighed its CO emissions share by its renewables share from 1990-2014.\n\nSurprisingly, such renewables share is observed to even surpass almost all of the top ten carbon emitting countries ",

Thomas was scheduled to work out at the Cavs' training facility in Independence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thomas said how his body responds from the stress of 5-on-5 scrimmages will determine how soon he'll be able to make his debut with Cleveland. He's been sidelined since aggravating a hip injury in the playoffs last season with the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Cavs have said since October that they believed Thomas would be able to play in NBA games by Jan. 1. The 28-year-old was acquired during a hectic offseason in a trade for All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving. The Celtics sent Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and a draft pick to Cleveland in the blockbuster deal.\n\nCleveland is eager to add him to the lineup, and LeBron James has sensed that Thomas is ready.\n\n\"Yeah, his attitude is getting worse and worse because he's getting closer and closer,\" James said following the team's morning shootaround before hosting the Chicago Bulls. \"When you get closer and closer to something you love and you want, your attitude actually gets worse.\"\n\nThomas, who averaged 28.9 points last season as one of the NBA's top playmakers, said he wants to be \"special\" when he returns to the floor and not \"just another body.\"\n\nAfter a slow start, the Cavaliers have won 18 of 20 and 11 straight at home. They'll visit the Golden State Warriors on Christmas and play at Sacramento and Utah next week before returning to Cleveland to face Portland on Jan. 2.\n\nThe next day, they'll play in Boston for their second matchup with Irving.

It may be scattered or widespread,” Quiblat told The FREEMAN by phone last night.\n\nAs of yesterday morning, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 was hoisted over southern Cebu (covering Talisay City to Santander town), as well as other areas in the Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nWhen a Signal No. 1 is raised, winds of 30-60 kilometers per hour with intermittent rains can be expected within at least 36 hours. In this case, plants and different crops might be uprooted and suffer significant damages and houses made of light materials may be partially unroofed.\n\nAs this report was written yesterday evening, Vinta had not yet reached landmass. In the 5 p.m. bulletin of PAGASA, Vinta was spotted 200 kilometers east of Surigao del Sur, where it is expected to make its first landfall.\n\nQuiblat said Vinta has maintained its direction moving westward and is predicted to cross areas in Mindanao. With this observation, there is lesser chance that Vinta would change direction to west-northwest and make a landfall in southern Cebu.\n\nQuiblat said there is also a slim chance that Vinta will further intensify and reach third category or “severe tropical storm.” In fact, it may weaken due to land interaction.\n\nHe said Vinta may even downgrade to first category “tropical depression” or maintain its strength as tropical storm (second category).\n\nDennis Atto, train",

They stand for at least an hour if not more and one thing very clear during rush hour is that there are never enough public utility vehicles within that three-hour window. Some people have tried to provide all sorts of solutions to address the need. Along Shaw Boulevard for instance you will notice vans, AUVs and even tricycles willing to take on passengers based on per head charges and at a much higher rate.\n\nBy law, it is all illegal one way or another. Illegal because the fares they charge are often double or triple the legal fares. But the reason they do so in the first place is because if they are caught, the price to pay to get out of jail or prevent law enforcers from impounding your vehicle is a very high price. We really can’t fault the LTFRB, local traffic authorities or the LTO for going after the “colorum,” because they are merely doing their jobs and implementing the law. The problem with all of this is that it does not address or solve the problem: People need a ride during rush hour.\n\nThis is the reason I am calling for INNOVATION and not just REGULATION. The current state of public transport specifically during rush hour seriously needs innovation. When the TAXI industry failed to service the needs and safety of their customers, the innovation came in the form of UBER and GRAB. That innovation initially got bogged down on the issue of “franchise” and remains to be fully sorted out. Now we have the perennial and perpetual problem of jeepney and AUV/van riders not having enough units for peak hours. There are many private vans and AUVs that could double up like Grab and UBER owners but the complicated, expensive and limited number of franchises available turn or scare away would be applicants.\n\nCrazy as it may sound, perhaps the LTFRB and the DOTr might consider studying a way where AUV and van owners can be “part–time or sideline operators” who can",

He’s the only fighter in history to win world titles in eight divisions from 112 pounds to 154, from flyweight to superwelterweight.

Manny isn’t just strong, he’s also quick. What makes his punch so powerful is he delivers with all of his heart and soul, like he puts his entire body behind every shot. Line them up.

Hearns was strong but Manny would take him out because of his glass jaw. Against Leonard, it would just be a matter of time before Manny lands. Manny is a volume puncher and when he fights 12 rounds, you won’t be able to avoid getting hit.”\n\nPeñalosa says not even Muhammad Ali did what Pacquiao has done. Pacquiao turned pro as a minimumweight, scaling 106 pounds in his debut. Then, he moved up in weight to win world titles at flyweight, superbantamweight, featherweight, superfeatherweight, lightweight, superlightweight, welterweight and superwelterweight.

For starters, the leaders of the ruling Partido Demokratikong Pilipino-Laban ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) have commissioned surveys to determine who among their candidates can make it in the tight race at the Senate.\n\nAt least seven of those running in 2019 are re-electionists. They are Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III (PDP-Laban) and Senators Cynthia Villar (NP), Grace Poe (independent), Nancy Binay (UNA), Sonny Angara (LDP), Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito (PMP) and Bam Aquino (LP).\n\nThose who will be drafted in the administration’s Senate slate will have an edge as President Rodrigo Duterte will back their individual bids. That is, if the President – as the nominal party chief of the PDP-Laban – remains popular with two-digit approval ratings by the time of the election period.\n\nPimentel earlier said he would ask Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez to be the national campaign manager for the administration’s Senate slate. Their battle cry, Pimentel vowed, would be “12-0” or a clean sweep of President Duterte’s ticket in the senatorial race.\n\nHowever, it will be a tough task for the PDP-Laban leadership as Pimentel and Alvarez, party president and secretary general, respectively are also running in the 2019 midterm polls.\n\nLast Oct. 6, Pimentel revealed the initial six senatorial candidates of the ruling party. Aside from him, Pimentel named the five other possible candidates of the PDP-Laban as Negros Occidental 3rd District Rep. Albee Benitez, Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman, Davao City 1st District Rep. Karlo Nograles, former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Francis Tolentino and House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas.\n\nTolentino ran as an independent candidate in the 2016 senatorial race but placed 13th, or outside the winning magic 12.

The fresh law takes effect 15 days after it is published in the Official Gazette or publications of general circulation.\n\nUnder the TRAIN, personal income tax rates will be adjusted to shift the burden off lower-income segments toward the “ultra-rich.”\n\nMeanwhile, projected revenues to be foregone from lower personal income tax will be offset by higher excise levies on petroleum and automobiles, among others.\n\nUnder its P8.44-trillion 2017-2022 “Build, Build, Build” program, the government aims to jack up its spending on infrastructure alone to P1.899 trillion, equivalent to 7.45 percent of gross domestic product, by the time Duterte ends his term in 2022.\n\nHowever, the estimated tax take from the new tax law is less than the Department of Finance had hoped to raise, with TRAIN expected to generate $1.8 billion in revenues in its first year.\n\nDespite the maverick leader’s huge popularity and Congress being dominated by his allies, Duterte’s TRAIN had also encountered some resistance, with some lawmakers criticizing certain “anti-poor” provisions of the bill.\n\nAmid mixed reactions over the revamp of the country’s tax system, what does the new law mean to ordinary Filipinos now that TRAIN has been given a green light to leave the station?\n\nHere are the items covered by the new tax law:",

Five cagers from Gavina’s fold registered double-digit production with former Road Warrior Eric Camson leading the charge with 24 points.\n\nTagged as the whipping boys of league, Kia was put on the hot seat after forgoing the first overall pick — which could’ve been Christian Standhardinger — in a bid to employ an “unconventional” approach in the new PBA season.\n\nFans and followers even went as far as translating the offseason move as Kia’s disinterest in competing.\n\n“I gave everybody this baller,” Gavina bared, pointing to a rubber band around his wrist. “[It] says ‘Nothing is impossible with God’ and that’s the mindset going in.”\n\n“If we put in the work, hopefully in our next game we come out on top,” he continued.\n\nFor three quarters, Kia was on the driver’s seat. Heck, they were even able to lead by as many as 13 markers in the game. If not for Larry Fonacier's four-point play late in game, the outcome would’ve been different.\n\nWhile falling short in their opening game definitely hurt, Gavina said they are keeping their heads up.\n\n“We showed our grit tonight. We showed a great deal of character in being able to keep up with what I feel is one of the contenders coming into this conference,” he explained.\n\n\"If we can do this against NLEX, we can do this against anybody,” Gavina declared.",

The consortium will work with foreign technical partners with proven world class track records and experiences in airport operations to improve, upgrade, and enhance the operational efficiencies of NAIA covering both landside and airside facilities,” the consortium said.\n\nThey said that like other countries, the Philippines could benefit from having an in-city and out-city airport such as Tokyo and London.\n\n“Numerous foreign and local experts have highlighted the advantage of keeping an airport within city limits. Like other major cities in the world, experts recommend an in-city airport and another one outside the metropolis to complement it. Megacities that benefit from a two-airport set-up include Tokyo (Haneda and Narita) and London (Gatwick and Heathrow),” they said.\n\nThey aim to upgrade NAIA to accommodate an additional 11 million passengers from the current 39.5 million and increase its hourly aircraft movements (landing and take-off) from 40 movements per hour to 48 movements per hour.\n\n“The unsolicited proposal is intended to help accelerate the government’s Build Build Build program.

Playing Bong is Jericho Rosales who, according to Cabiling, “is a deep talent with a big heart and epic range” recognized with multiple Best Actor wins for films like Baler, Alagwa and Pacquiao The Movie.\n\nThe team is hoping to finish the short film in early January next year as soon as Jericho has time to shoot. “The aim is to film the short in January and move onto the full feature by spring or summer of 2018,” Cabiling explained.\n\nJoining the team is Cabiling’s co-producer Darlene Malimas whose films Aparisyon, Da Dog Show and Señorita were shown in festivals abroad.

As much of a pain as it is to head out these days, there’s no escaping all those invites to class reunions and barkada get-togethers.\n\nSometimes we don’t want to veer that far away from home, but it can be a struggle to find a unique place that’s both photo-friendly but still easy-on-the-pocket. For those living in the South, Buku-Buku Kafé might be your answer. Situated between all the usual local and international chains inside SM Southmall is a quaint little café that serves Southeast Asian food.\n\nRun by siblings Jessica and Nicholas Santiago, Buku Buku means “many, many books” in Bahasa Malaysia and was named so in honor of their dad, who lives and works in Malaysia. As an artist and musician respectively, the two started the café as a way to create a space for art and literature to flourish in the South. They have a library of books and zines that you can check out. With a cozy and light atmosphere, the café’s interiors easily serve as the perfect background for all those “candid” group photos. If you’re feelin’ a little extra, the second floor has a wall made entirely of book pages.\n\nIt isn’t just an Instagram-worthy place, either. This Christmas, Buku-Buku is introducing Big Plates in which they’ll offer their bestsellers in larger portions. I recommend the Three-Way Sisig made of pork, tofu and tuna. It’s a hearty meal that has just the right amount of spice and zing, and it’s great for splitting with three to five people. The Darling Tuna Belly, made of tuna steak and peri-peri sauce, is great for those looking for a healthier option. It comes with mashed squash that’s divine. For dessert, try the festive Champorado de Suman, which is like a mash-up of all your typical Filipino holiday fare. Think: champorado shaped as a suman, with a cup of tsokolate on the side.\n\nIf you’re a last-minute gifter, there’s no need to make a mad dash around the mall anymore. The",

The real challenge is to face the economic forces and the lack of certain incentives among citizens that have pushed the city into the current situation.\n\nCorruption might be one of the causes. I cannot honestly imagine a Filipino mayor denying the permit for the construction of a condo tower or a big mall in an already congested area when offered by a wealthy developer.

While American business supports most parts of the Tax Reform and Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill, which was passed by the Senate and House, there is one particular part of the bill which could send the wrong signal to international investors and long-term friends of the Philippines.\n\nSpecifically, the sections of the TRAIN bill that seemingly overlooked the consumers, who want lower prices for their foods and drinks and the right to choose what they consume. If passed, by the bicameral review process this week, the new law would raise prices for Filipinos, restrict choice and result in reduced investment, lost jobs and send a message to investors from around the world that the Philippines is willing to violate global trading rules. The Congress moved forward despite opposition coming from domestic associations and international players who are long-term investors in the Philippines.\n\nThis new legislation should be carefully reconsidered. The House of Representatives and the Senate are currently reconciling their respective versions of the bill and are aiming to submit the final version to President Duterte before they recess on Dec. 16, 2017.\n\nBut if Congress passes this bill, with the unequal provisions on the sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intact, it won’t be Christmas for the consumers or to companies considering investments in the Philippines. The SSB provisions call for a doubled tax rate on sweeteners that are produced largely outside the Philippines but play a critical role in meeting Filipino demand for high quality and affordable food and beverage products.

Worse, we have seen how victims of these weather events suffer endlessly with the snail-paced rehabilitation efforts by our government, as shown by the Yolanda tragedy where the people affected are either given substandard homes or are still living in subhuman conditions four years after the infamous typhoon struck and despite the downpour of financial assistance.\n\nThe paper entitled: “Blameless in Stratosphere: Carbon Footprint, Manufacturing Growth, and the Fuel Mix Debate in the Philippines,” presented in a Stratbase-ADR Institute roundtable discussion, is able to put in context the Philippines’ contribution to climate change. Essentially, it highlighted that the Philippines has a very small carbon footprint with per capita carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions lower than African countries such as Angola, Congo and Djibouti. Notably, Dr. Raul Fabella, et al. looked at other Asian countries in their respective years of comparable development to 2011 Philippines.\n\nInterestingly, the country’s 0.9 metric tons per capita CO emissions was significantly lower than 1968 Singapore (2.7 metric tons), 1982 South Korea (3.6 metric tons) and 2004 China (4.1 metric tons). In this comparison, the Philippines, at 2011 development level, was closest to 1991 Thailand and 2008 Indonesia, both at 1.8 metric tons of per capita CO emissions. With such a small carbon footprint, the Philippines is said to have remarkably outweighed its CO emissions share by its renewables share from 1990-2014.\n\nSurprisingly, such renewables share is observed to even surpass almost all of the top ten carbon emitting countries in the same period.

This triumvirate plus the wisdom of Chief Justice Jun Davide should convene all Cebuano leaders and form a united front. The time has come to unite.\n\nMy dream team is for Vice Mayor Edgardo Labella to run for congressman to replace Raul del Mar, who should retire by now from politics and become a senior ambassador. After all, he has already proven that he is a good and honest leader. Edgardo is the new blood who can well represent the district with more dynamism, more passion, and more visibility for the Cebu brand. Mayor Tom should stay in the City Hall because we need continuity and discipline in the city. The criminals are afraid of him and he loves the policemen. Mayor Tom is beginning to look like Digong, and I like that. Former mayor Rama should run and win as congressman in Cebu City south and really make our city well-represented as a brilliant lawyer, parliamentarian, and legislator. Labella and Rama will make a better tandem to make Cebu City better represented in the House.\n\nGovernor Junjun Davide’s temperament is suited for the House representing the second district. Willy Caminero should become Governor since he is a man of action rather than words. And Representative Gwen is now ripe for the Senate. We have no Cebuano senator and Gwen is the most well-known with her sterling performance as Deputy Speaker. President Digong ",

It will be one part tourism, then we will have an advice segment on beauty and wellness (as well as) lifestyle. We will also feature personalities and local businesses,” says Anjanette (also fondly called AJ), who is best known for her portrayal of Filipino superhero Darna at the height of her acting career in the Philippines.\n\nAJ also wants to highlight the Filipinos in Southern California in the show and then expand it to bigger markets.\n\n“I might get a local celebrity as a co-host, I want to make it interesting and different every time,” adds the Bb. Pilipinas-Universe 1991 who has an international capital broker dealership career here.\n\nAJ is working in a company called 1 Heart Care Giving Services, a private home care and medical services company that opened 14 years ago. She is the client care manager in charge of making sure the clients and the caregivers are working together smoothly.\n\n“The owner is a Filipina, her married name is Bell Menberd, but she hails from Bacolod so we are both Ilongga so I feel at home with her. I enjoy working with the company because they are very inspiring. I prayed to have a job that gives back, then my friend called me to ask if I would be interested to work for this company. I never thought of doing something like this but I said maybe this is the answer to my prayer so I tried and so far I like it,” shares AJ who has been with the company for four months.\n\nKnown for being a sexy actress, AJ keeps her body fit and beautiful by working out at least an hour three times a week. She is now doing workouts with the guidance of boxing trainer Marvin Somodio.\n\n“It’s my first time ever doing boxing, this is different oh my God, it is",
