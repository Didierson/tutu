Then I came to Russia to learn Russian for a year, then I entered a top Russian university and got a Russian law degree, then I left and started working in Switzerland again a few years in banks that deal with Russia. I missed Russia so I found a job with a foreign bank in Moscow - but I found it in Switzerland because I knew a top manager.I know many foreign students or young people to come and try to find jobs here in Russia. In my experience they usually fail because no Russian employer wants to go through the visa support for a young guy without job experience. And if you get a job it won't be paid well. I'd say 90% of the expatriates here in Moscow were sent here by their western employer from abroad.So you want to go to Russian/""insert your home country here"" business events where you are, and make friends with the people there. Is there a Russian chamber of commerce where you live? If yes, go to their events.For an employer in the west who has a business in Russia it is sometimes hard to find someone who is willing to relocate to Russia so look for this win win.Another way is to move there and start your own business.In the 12 years I deal with Russia I have never heard of any expat who married to get a permit.If I were to come here to set up a business I'd probably do something IT related (some app). I'd research some businesses that proved successful in the west and aren't yet exploited here properly. Then once I'd have 3 ideas I'd look which one is easiest to implement and put the other 2 on hold.Then I'd sign up to a language school for foreigners such as www.cie.ru. Make sure they give you access to a dorm where Russian students live - this way you get a visa, cheap accommodation and access to tons of poor but brilliant students who will be happy to work on your project for little pay. Then I'd just start working and see how it goes. Once you make some money you hire a lawyer and only then do you actually set things up properly e.g. start a limited company which will provide you with work visa etc.Of course you will need some funds to guarantee your survival for at least a year.Find something that puts you apart from Russian employees e.g. Fluency in English or understanding of a particular business/branch Russian employees lack. Especially in times of crisis no one hires an expensive expat without solid reasons.One way is through the top executive route. Many western companies and even some Russian ones only hire westerners for Top management positions. I know several companies that don't have a single Russian person on top. Sometimes they have no knowledge about Russia whatsoever and still get a CEO job.I know some young auditor who was made CFO in Russia in a well known company just because he once spent a semester in Russia and said he'd be happy to go back. In his home country he would probably had to wait another 10 years to get up so quickly.About Padre Damaso",HIGHEST PAID JOBS IN RUSSIA

It also helps with, you know, body odor.In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you.Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you cant argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat.Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. Barya lang po sa umaga! No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please.Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know.If you dont want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant.The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. God knows who doesnt pay, says one jeepney sign.There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: Bayad po (heres my fare) and Para po (this is my stop).If you dont speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepneys roof. It also means please stop.There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say one senior or one student when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare.Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isnt that nice?As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.Advertisements",Tutorial: Riding The Philippine Jeepney

It was built by the Spaniards as a settlement for Catholic Chinese, and was positioned across the Pasig River so that the colonial rulers could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects. To this day, it continues to be a center of commerce and trade in Manila where all types of businesses are run by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry.Almost a quarter of the Philippines 100 Million population are of Chinese descent, and China is demanding loyalty from them.The administration of Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino immediately protested the Chinese announcement, saying China cannot just kidnap 25 percent of our population.

Charity is not what less developed economies and small businesses need. What they need are greater market access and the opportunity to participate in growth and development. Unless we adopt this mindset, inclusive growth will continue to elude us.Ayon sa ulat ng Bombo Radyo, ang Pangulo ay magiging abala sa kanyang ikalawang araw sa Vietnam kung saan dinaraos ang APEC Summit.Nagkaroon din ng bilateral meeting ang Commander-in-Chief sa Vietnam at hinarap din niya ang Filipino community doon, ayon sa ulat ng TV Patrol.Samantala, nananawagan naman ang Human Rights Watch sa mga lider ng bansa na pag-usapan ang kalagayan ng karapatang pantao sa Pilipinas, ayon sa ulat ng Radyo Inquirer.Panoorin ang iba pang detalye sa video na ito:","Duterte, hinikayat ang mayayamang miyembro ng APEC at ASEAN na tulungan ang mahihirap na bansa"

Its indeed a very profitable business. Thats why many people, especially house wives and working students are opting to start an online business by simply using different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and different selling applications like Carousell and Shopee.Usually, these online sellers sell make-ups, ready-to-wear clothes, shoes, home supplies and stuff they no longer need but one online seller went far beyond in her online business.A concerned citizen uploaded several screenshots of a Facebook profile whos under the name of Ellaine Sumbaga as it is selling abortion kits at a very affordable price. Its really sickening to see that there are online sellers who are selling illegal medicines and victimize innocent babies, not giving them a chance to experience life.The Facebook uploader seeks help from other netizens to report the account, she even managed to supply some proofs of transactions uploaded by Ellaine and a conversation with Ellaines customer with a picture of an underdeveloped fetus.The complainant added that Ellaine might be using another name or the account was already deactivated because when she tried to search again the Facebook account of the seller, she can no longer see it.Looking at the screenshots provided by the uploader, its really alarming that this seller sells different abortion kits from Cytotec, Misoprostol, Ferrous and Methergine and offers them at a very affordable price.For those who are 1 to 2 months pregnant, shes charging them for 2,000 pesos and for 3 to 5 months pregnant, shes charging 3,500 pesos. You can also add 1,000 pesos for painless abortion which she advises for women who will abort for the first time.We hope that the police and the authorities find this culprit and give the necessary sanctions.Source : Facebook",Netizen Seeks Help to Report Online Seller Who Sells Illegal Abortion Kits

This specifically applies in Metro Manila since there are places where number coding is not observed such as in Marikina and in Muntinlupa City.The vehicles banned from plying the roads on a particular day are determined by their plates ending number: 1-2 on Mondays, 3-4 on Tuesdays, 5-6 on Wednesdays, 7-8 on Thursdays and 9-0 on Fridays. However, number coding is suspended on Saturdays and Sundays.Recently, Luis Manzano had posted a photo on his Instagram account involving an MMDA whom he admired for his honesty at work.According to Manzano, that day, his driver forgot that their vehicle was banned from traveling along the roads of Metro Manila because of number coding.Suddenly, an MMDA noticed their plate number and approached them. The MMDA asked for a drivers license which his driver willingly surrendered as he was totally aware of his violation.What caught the attention of Luis was the fact that the MMDA issued a ticket to them for their violation without insinuating the desire to extort money from them which, sadly, some MMDA personnel do.Luis admired the honesty of the MMDA and decided to share it on social media.Nakalimutan ng driver ko na coding kami, good job kay sir MMDA, di humingi ng kahit ano or nagparamdam ng lagay.

Yan ang sinabi ng mga ibat ibang licensed holders sa buong mundo. Licensed holders ng Miss World nung pagka mayroon kaming meeting every year, ang tanong nila, What is it about the Philippines that you keep winning the crowns? You keep placing and winning.' I said, You know, Filipinas are born beautiful, so get used to it. We will keep on winning crowns.'As a former Miss World license holder and pageant organizer, Quirino gave an advice to all beauty queen aspirants.Para sa lahat ng lalaban [at] aspring international beauty queens, its one thing to win the national crown here in the Philippines, iba ang labanan sa international pageant. Kailangan ipakita talaga ang gilas mo, kailangang ipakita mo rin ang puso mo. When you walk on the stage, youre not just walking, holding the Philippine flag, waving the Philippine flag on stage, but you have to show the world that you are very sincere about it. You have to be authentic so that the judges will see that you are not rehearsed, memorized, scripted, de kahon or whatever. You really have to show your originality and your authenticity.In an interview with PEP, Quirino shared that she now enjoys having more time for her advocacies and other things that she wanted to do as she is no longer a franchisee of Miss World Philippines.Im happy actually, I can spend most of my time now focusing on my advocacies and things the I have always wanted to do. [Im] writing my new book, starting my wellness blogang dami pang mga proyekto that were placed on hold because of Miss World. I gave most of my time and energy [there]. Talagang kinain niya ang oras ko saka yung energy ko. Sabi ko, hindi ako magbibitiw ng pageant, ng license, hanggat di manalo ang Pilipinas sa Miss World. Nanalo tayo kay Megan [Young], napaaga ang aking hamon sa sarili. After we won, sabi ko, baka puwede na. I can turn it over to somebody else.However, she said she believes she had done enough in building the brand and was able to deliver the crown of Ms. World which everyone thought was impossible.I think we made all the Filipino pageant fans so happy. I kept my promises, I worked so hard with my team and, of course, we were blessed, because Megan joined us. So, yun, everything fell into place in 2013.In 2013, Megan Young won the first Miss World Title of the Philippines. Since then, Quirino had ended her ties with Miss World Philippines. But then, Quirino claims she still has communication with the past winners of the said beauty pageant.The new license holder of Ms. World Philippines is Arnold Vegafria who is a talent manager. But she claims she still supports them in spirit.Quirino also shared that in her 6 years of experience, she finds it hard for an individual who doesnt have a big company or agency to look after a pageant for it involves a big financial requirement. In fact, she added that most of the licenses of the pageants all over the world are owned by a network or a very big entertainment company.Quirino believes that a formidable company should be the one to hold an international license in order to sustain its strength and longevity.Source : PEP News",Cory Quirino Remains Confident with Filipinas Winning International Beauty Crowns

According to his post, it took 30 minutes for the staff to find the gadget  and only when the family complained a lot and caused a ruckus.The incident happened last October 20.As expected, Hizons post went viral, with many people bashing the airport staff and sharing their own experiences of supposed theft at the NAIA.But Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Ed Monreal cried foul over the viral report, revealing that based on their investigation, the alleged theft did not happen at all.The agency later released CCTV footage of the incident, showing the kid taking off his watch and putting it on the space next to the x-ray machine; although it wasnt clear whether he placed it inside a basket or not.When the family claimed their belongings, they did cause a ruckus at the area but the staff immediately helped them out and the item was found within 3 minutes, not 30 minutes as the post claimed. According to Montreal, it was unfair for the staff to be accused of theft when they had done nothing wrong.Watch this report on the incident:Source : GMA News","Family Accuses NAIA Staff of Trying to Steal Boy’s Expensive Smartwatch, But CCTV Footage Proves Them Wrong"

This moment usually happens when we either dont feel like ourselves or having a lot going through our minds. This may result in doing something we never intend to do. Being preoccupied usually leads ourselves doing something embarrassing but, sometimes, worth sharing on social media.This happened to Armin Sta. Maria, one day she sat beside the jeepney drivers seat and didnt realize that shes already assisting the driver in accepting fares and giving out change.A passenger who was probably sitting behind her was handing a 20-peso bill; without second thought, she took the money and gave the change. The funny thing is, Armin is not a family member, nor do they know each other. She just realized what she was doing when the driver laughed and asked her if shes giving the right amount.She posted this really hilarious experience on her Facebook account wherein it was shared more than 4,500 times and gained reactions from more than 17,000 people.The funny thing is, the new generations of today are giving a new term for people who hand out the fares and change  the one who usually sits near the driver, they call it OJT. Some people do not want to be located in the area where the OJT sits because they will have no choice but to hand out the fares and change.So, netizens find this really funny because Armi seemed to volunteer herself as an OJT. Some are sharing their own embarrassing moments and some people said that this also happened to them.",Netizen Shares Her Hilarious ‘Sabaw’ Moment When She Absentmindedly Gives Out Change in Jeep

Kili-kili, Wao, Lanao del Sur after attending to some personal errands in Cagayan de Oro City, while the policemen were on their way back to the Bumbaran Municipal Police Station.Meanwhile, responding troops from the 1st Special Forces Battalion recovered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED/Landmine), 200 meters wire, detonating cords, empty shells of AK-47 rifle ammunitions, and subversive documents at the area where the incident transpired.These acts committed by the NPA bandits are clear violations of the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law or CARHRIHL between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDF as this agreement prohibits attacks against civilians and non-combatants and bans the use of landmine.Brigadier General Eric C Vinoya AFP, Commander of the 403rd Infantry Brigade, vehemently condemned this yet another barbaric act of the bandit group. He also lambasted the perpetrators for their lack of regard to human life, most especially the civilians, as evident by their indiscriminate use of firearms.We condemn in the strongest possible terms this barbaric act committed by the perpetrators of this incident which resulted to the tragic death of a four-month old baby girl and one of our police personnel. said Brigadier General Vinoya.These perpetrators can be compared to savages, infant killers, and murderers of innocent civilians, who thrive on abusing the weak by using coercion and intimidation, without giving any regard to human life and established laws.

Dera extoted monay and vehicles from Peter Co, a high-profile drug lord jailed at New Bilibid Prison, for the lady senator's senatorial campaign last May 2016 election.Peter Co gave P3 million, which were from the proceeds from selling illegal drugs while still in Bilibid, and also four vehicles through Dera for de Lima's campaign.The senator is detained at the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame for a previous arrest order by Judge Juanita Guerrero of the Muntinlupa RTC Branch 204. However, there is still a pending case before Muntinlupa RTC Branch 206, under Judge Patria Manalastas-De Leon for the senator.De Lima previously filed a petition at the Supreme Court seeking for the higher court to nullify her first arrest order.Senator Leila de Lima has three criminal charges filed against her.First case is Criminal Case Number 17-165 which is handled by Branch 204, one count of violation of Section 5 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, which penalizes the ""sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution and transportation of illegal drugs.""De Lima allegedly asked money from the New Bilibid inmates ti fund her senatorial bid n 2016.Second case is the second count of drug trade which is handled by Branch 206 against De Lima; former BuCor chief Franklin Jesus Bucayu; Bucayus former staff, Wilfredo Elli; inmate Jaybee Sebastian; Dayan; De Limas former security aide, Joenel Sanchez; and a certain Jad de Vera.The mentioned inmates allegedy forced to produce P70 million in order to provide funds of Senator Leila de Lima's senatorial campaign.Third case is Criminal Case Number 17-166, handled by Branch 205, is another count of drug trade against De Lima and De Vera.As in the other two cases, De Lima allegedly extorted money from Co, who was able to produce P30 million and 4 vehicles which were given to De Lima through De Vera. This allegedly happened in March 2016.The Department of Justice (DOJ) dismissed the drug charges against inmates Herbert Colanggo, Engelbert Durano, Vicente Sy, Jojo Baligad, and Peter Co because ""they will be utilized as prosecution witnesses.""",June 2017

Salonga, to Ramon A. Diaz, to Adolf S. Azcuna, to Mateo T. Caparas and to David M. Castro.And yet, not one of them and Aquino had rendered to the nation a complete individual accounting of the purloined assets despite the constitutional mandate in Section 1, Article XI, that: ""Public officers and employees must, at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives.""On March 3, 1999, the PCGG, exactly 17 years today after its creation, is still enmeshed in a web of legal controversies, onerous compromise deals and accusations of graft and corruption.The quasi-judicial body, with vast powers to sequester, issue summonses and grant immunity from prosecution, was also mandated to prevent concealment, destruction and dissipation of assets; investigate cases of corruption; and adopt safeguards to ensure the plunder shall not be repeated in succeeding administrations.To ensure success, the Aquino regime allotted P649 million for its recovery efforts, set up offices here and abroad, employed more than 1,500 foreign and local lawyers, accountants, intelligence agents, fiscal agents and asset monitors, and gave the PCGG unhampered access to all branches of government.But what happened?In six years ending June 30, 1992, the PCGG recovered only P4,216,654,434.09 in cash, less than P10 billion in kind and $356 million in Swiss bank pledges out of the $15 billion the Aquino administration claimed Marcos, his relatives, friends and cronies had plundered in 20 years. Some estimates even placed the purloined assets at between P25 billion and $250 billion, including gold hordes.But how could this be possible when Marcos's official accumulated budget in 20 years was only P486.42 billion?This is a highly controversial government agency that should not escape President Duterte's attention.",May 2017

Paul, a friend he knew which was a member of the Magdalo group which Trillanes functioned under, the Senator only wanted to be assigned inside offices to avoid physical combat.Trillanes was a coward who avoided combat, says MAGDALO memberTrillanes, according to the source, was a ""political mercenary but has no balls in actual combat and confrontationas, ika nga puro daldal""Trillanes has been vocal in opposing President Rodrigo Duterte and his drug war.Read full letter below:Sorry to say but one of my close friend is the mistah or batch of Trollanes in PMA Batch Marilag Class 95 & now an army scout ranger battalion commander & he is a humble soldier with a lot of gold cross medals.He told me that Trollanes has never experienced combat & was a pencil pusher in the NAVY office all thru out his career as a soldier meaning he always wants to be assigned in offices to avoid combat.BTW he was never the brains or the original founder of the Magdalo Group , it was Capt Gerry Gambala who is the real brains & leader of the Magdalo Group & the majority of the Magdalo Group now are working as Intel Officers in BOC recruited by Com Faeldon who was also a member of the group before, that is why there are 2 factions now in the Magdalo.Trollanes is dissapointed also because majority of the group are now with the PRRD admin only a few left on his group that includes the party list congressman named Gary Alejano who keeps on defending Delima too, my close friend told me that they even have a joke on Sunny Trollanes.They call him "" Boy Hotel "" because he keeps on hiding in hotels when plotting a coup, he only joined the Oakwood Mutiny 2 weeks before the coup & he volunteered as spokesman kaya sumikat ang gago ika nga he was a late comer to the group.We ilonggos & his mistahs describe him as "" TALAWAN "" or COWARD kasi ayaw pumunta sa gyera sa bundok gusto mag schooling lang at mag opisina sa HQ.He is a paid political mercenary but has no balls in actual combat & confrontations ika nga puro daldal lang at porma na parang asong ulol ....he was never a combat officer & a be medaled soldier itanong nyo sa mga mistah nya kung anong klaseng tao sya alam nila halos lahat na "" Talawan "" sya ....at tunay na Sundalong Kanin!-Cated J Paul",March 2017
0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,11,0,1413367,0,0,"But this idea lost to the idea of a revolutionary President Cory Aquino, he did not say how. But he was genuinely taken aback when Cory abolished the 1973 Constitution, and replaced it first with the so-called Freedom Constitution, and then with the 1987 Constitution. He apparently had thought that the 1973 Constitution could be amended to put in the reforms from the envisioned ""revolutionary council."" Initially appointed as Cory's defense chief, they quickly had a falling out, and he found himself leading the campaign against the new Constitution, drafted by Cory's handpicked constitutional commissioners.Cory stayed on as President after the promulgation of the new Constitution on February 2, 1987, under a provision, which extended ""the six-year term of the incumbent President and Vice President elected in the February 7, 1986 electionfor purposes of synchronization of electionsto June 30, 1992."" Enrile shared the view expressed earlier in this column that this provision, as worded, applies to Marcos and his running mate, Arturo Tolentino, who were declared ""elected"" in that election, even though they were not allowed to sit. Cory and Salvador ""Doy"" Laurel were never elected.There was an offer from the Batasan to revoke the proclamation of Marcos and Tolentino in favor of Cory and Doy, but Cory rejected this, so the proclamation was never revoked, Enrile explained. Cory therefore sat as usurper for the next six-and-a-half years. This probably explained why Cory was subjected to so many coup attempts, and would have fallen, were it not for the intervention of the US Air Force during her most critical moment.For the first time since 1986, Enrile revealed the reason for the EDSA revolt. This is a detail I had missed in my reading of Enrile's memoir, launched in Manila in 2012. Enrile said that on Marcos's visit to the US in 1982, he learned that the President had developed an unnamed sickness, which compelled him to stay on one floor of the Waldorf Astoria's in New York, while his wife stayed on another. There he also learned that General Fabian Ver, the AFP Chief of Staff, who was also chief of presidential security, intelligence, and a few other things, had begun contemplating a military junta of five generals who would take over the government under Mrs. Imelda Marcos should anything happen to the President.Should Marcos die, the Cabinet would be summoned to Malacaang and kept there before his death was made public, while he himself would be eliminated, Enrile said. Enrile took this information seriously and began planning his counter-move, he said. His first moves included acquiring 300 Uzis and 500 Galils, out of his own corporate funds. The rest is history. (Juan Ponce Enrile, A Memoir is available at Amazon.com)Given PDU30's own health condition, I find this detail especially relevant to us at this time. PDU30 has openly admitted his various afflictions, but refuses to allow an impartial medical analysis to diagnose and declare his actual medical condition. The constitutional line of succession exists, but DU30's communist partners appear determined to prevent a constitutional successor from taking over should DU30 be summoned by his Maker before his term ends. It appears that Mr. Evasco will leave no stone unturned to put a revolutionary government in place, before anything happens to the President.This would make Vice President Leni Robredo and former Senator Bongbong Marcos, who is contesting the vice presidency, and the Senate President and the Speaker of the House, who are all in the line of succession, totally irrelevant. In Enrile's case, he and the military had to mount a coup to prevent five generals from taking over should Marcos die. In Evasco's case, he has to make sure a revolutionary government is in place to prevent a constitutional successor from taking over, should PDU30 prematurely depart the scene. Is there anyone who will prevent him from carrying out his scheme? Don't you think he should be wearing Enrile's old shoes, right now?",February 2017

1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,"Senator De Lima argues a point at the Senate hearing on Extra Judicial Killing (EJK). Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA - Malacaang on Monday denied accusations of an international human rights group that the drug cases against Senator Leila de Lima are politically motivated, insisting that these are criminal in nature.Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the group Human Rights Watch (HRW) disregards the rights of the Philippines as a nation that must be protected against illegal drugs by calling on ""foreign governments to step up to denounce the Duterte administration"" for alleged human rights violations.It banally disregards the right of a nation to protect its citizens against the menace of a global drug industry, and terrorist-connected drug trade; and that it has done so with assumption of regularity, Abella said in a statement.The HRW on Sunday said the Duterte administration is abusing the judicial system to punish critics of its drug war, such as the drug cases filed against De Lima, who once initiated a Senate inquiry into the President's bloody campaign against illegal drugs.""The prosecution of Senator Leila de Lima is an act of political vindictiveness that debases the rule of law in the Philippines, said Phelim Kine, HRW deputy Asia director.The group also noted that attacks against De Lima intensified after a witness, self-professed hitman Edgar Matobato, accused the President of ordering assassinations when he was still Davao mayor.The Department of Justice last Friday filed three drug trafficking cases against De Lima for which bail may be denied.De Lima's case is not politically motivated. It is, simply put, 'criminal in nature.' The human rights organization might bear that in mind before it attempts to obligate the Duterte administration, Abella said.Abella added that the HRW broadly paints the ""killings of thousands of alleged drug uses and drug dealers after Duterte took office on June 30"" - without identifying what deaths belonged to police operations, deaths not related to drugs and extrajudicial killings.Human Rights Watch blithely ignores the approximately 1,000,000 users and dealers who turned themselves in, the discovery of industrial size illegal drug factories, and the unimaginable extent that 'narco-politics' has gripped local politics, law-enforcement and to some extent the legislative and judicial departments, Abella said.If found guilty, De Lima faces between 12 years to life in prison. Under the law, legislators only enjoy privilege from arrest for crimes punishable by less than 6 years imprisonment.",Palace denies De Lima drug cases are 'politically motivated'

Wearing a black skullcap, he paused in front of the holiest site where Jews can pray, then placed what appeared to be a written prayer or note between its stones, as is custom.SPONSORTrump was not accompanied by any Israeli leaders during the hugely symbolic visit.Allowing them to do so could have led to accusations that Washington was implicitly recognizing Israel's unilateral claim of sovereignty over the site, which would break with years of US and international precedent.Security was tight, with the usually bustling Old City, where the Western Wall is located, essentially on lockdown and the plaza leading to the site cleared.As Trump's convoy of dozens of cars entered the square around 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), armed security forces were positioned on nearly every building nearby as well as on the outer wall of the Old City.In the nearby Jewish Quarter, barriers had been erected to make viewing the square impossible from ground level, and some residents said they had been told not to go onto their roofs overlooking the Western Wall.Simon, a 20-year-old American studying in a nearby Jewish seminary, said he was ""excited"" by Trump's visit but disappointed he would not see him.Around a dozen ultra-Orthodox Jewish men had crammed into a tiny terrace on top of one house looking over, seemingly having been granted permission.Share this story!Visit and follow our website: Duterte Hot News Duterte Hot NewsSource: #http://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/05/23/17/trump-becomes-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-western-wall",Trump becomes first sitting US president to visit Western Wall

Offer them an ear to listen.One positive way to challenge volatile behavior is to actually open up a line of communication between you and this person. Who knows what kinds of problems this person faces mentally, physically, or otherwise, and maybe no one gives them the time of day to really talk about their issues.Be that person who combats their anger with compassion, and tells them they have the floor for whatever is bothering them. You might just encourage them to put an end to their struggles and come up with a proactive solution.Everyone deals with pain differently, and maybe they just need someone to show them how to channel it in a more productive way. Moreover, everyone fights silent battles on a daily basis  you never know what people have endured and for how long, so show a little understanding when you can.2. Walk away, if possible.We know this advice doesnt really apply in a workplace, but you can still distance yourself from coworkers who continually put out bad vibes. This tip more specifically relates to relationships you have in your life; if your friend, boyfriend, or girlfriend always seems to put you in a bad mood, dont hesitate to get out of the situation.Everyone goes through tough times, but it indicates a much deeper issue if they cant go one day without complaining or putting themselves in a victim mentality. Of course, some people suffer from chronic depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or other mental problems, but this still doesnt mean they get a free pass to treat you poorly or project their feelings onto you.If you have tried to help them but they choose to remain in misery, you eventually have to let them deal with their problems on their own terms. You cannot claim responsibility for everyones happiness; its an inside job.3. Create some me time in your schedule.Toxic people can drain your energy pretty quickly if you have to endure their company in the workplace or at home. Make sure to take time to re-center yourself and rid your mind of the heavy energies so they dont make a permanent home in your own energy field.Dealing with these types of people day in and day out can become exhausting, and will really deplete your energy stores after a while. Recuperation and rest matter, especially in the world we live in today.4. Kindly point out that their behavior hurts others around them.Some people will take advantage of your kindness and sincerity, unleashing their hostility onto you. Make sure you make them well aware of your boundaries, and dont walk on eggshells around them just because they cant seem to reign in their own emotions. Let them know that their behavior affects everyone around them, and you wont tolerate it any longer.No one should have to consistently deal with conniving, manipulative, or brash behavior, and you should nip it in the bud before people think they can get away with it. Maybe this will get them to change their tune so others will want to be around them more.5. Remember that how people treat you is their karma.Sometimes, you just have to keep in mind the laws of the universe, and that negative people will have to face the consequences of their behavior. Everything always comes back full circle, so just remember to treat them with love and compassion, because you have control of your own karma.Others may not be aware of these divine laws, or they may not care, but this remains constant: ultimately, how others treat you is out of your hands, so just sit back and watch the universe respond accordingly.6. Do something to make their day better.You can either sit there and watch someone struggle, or offer to help them up. You always have a choice in the moment, so choose kindness. Choose compassion. Bring them some food on their lunch break if they have piles of work to finish and you know they cant leave, bake them some cookies and leave them on their desk, or make them a homemade crafty gift to show you care.This world could use more acts of kindness, and a lot of people are hurting right now  be the person that lifts others up even if they always bring you down. Maybe you can be the one to encourage them to start looking on the brighter side of life.7. Smile.How can someone possibly keep spouting off negative vibes when you meet that energy with a smile? It will immediately put them in a better place of perspective, and remind them that this world still has good people left. Maybe they have a very negative home life and dont have a lot of emotional support. Maybe they feel neglected or unloved, so spread your love with your smiles. It will even uplift your own mood, and help others around you.The simple, small act of smiling can create enormous changes in Earths energy  use it abundantly!Dealing with difficult attitudes from others is a sure path to patience, compassion and kindness",7 Ways to Deal with Toxic Attitudes

He is proud of and fortunate to be head of such a large family.Ziona is chief of the Christian sect known as Chana Pawl, which was established by his father. The sect practices polygamy. Chana sect followers claim that its origin is traced to the Bibles Revelation Chapter 20 to Kum Sang Rorel or the rule of 1,000 years by Jesus Christ on Earth.The sect was originally named Khuangtuaha Pawl, after the founder Khuangtuaha. He founded it on 12 June 1942, when its disciples were removed from Hmawngkawn village by the headman of the village for propagating a theology considered wrong and dangerous. The sect celebrates its founding day as Bawkte Kut or the festival of the hut on June 12 every year. Members of the Chana sect number about 2,000 who reside in the Baktawng Tlangnuam village.Family lifeZiona hails from the village of Baktawng in central Serchhip district, which is 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the south of Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. He was born on 20 July 1945. He was married at the age of 17 to Zathiangi, his first wife, who was older than him by three years. She now controls the household activities of the family with strict discipline and is proud that everyone in the family respects her role. Ten of his wives he married in the span of one year.Ziona has built a four-storied mansion, a concrete structure, which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family. The house is called the Chhuan That Run or the House of the New Generation and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng. There is also a khualbuk or a guesthouse to accommodate visitors coming to the village.Ziona has a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives take turns to sleep with him according to a roster.His younger wives stay close to his room on the same floor and there are always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them.All his wives claim to love him. His 39th wife is Madam Siamthangi who is proud to be Zionas wife even though he is much older than her. She is 30 years old (as of 2012) and has a five-year-old daughter by him. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they get a week to spend with him.He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He says that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembers the names of every member of his family.Zionas family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He does not seek any assistance from the government.Zionas wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture (jhum cultivation), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth.Daily family life in his house begins at 5.50 AM when all family members assemble for prayers and thereafter daily duties are assigned. Prayers and meals are held in a large hall in the mansion. Dinner is served from 4 to 6 PM in the order of age, and the day comes to a close with everyone retiring for the night by 9PM when the lights are switched off.An enormous amount of food is prepared to feed the family: 220 pounds (100 kg) of rice, 132 pounds (60 kg) of potatoes and 39 chickens.Zionas 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests.Ripleys Believe It or Not!, while recording Zionas family as the largest living family in the world, observed: Its a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching 19 Kids and Counting or Sister Wives. The 66-year-old Indian man has 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren.Ziona is interested in having more wives, even from the United States.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziona",World’s Largest Family With 39 Wives And 94 Children

0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,24,0,15001707,6589,3,"Ive heard blogging referred to a couple of times recently as a mixture between an art and a science. If this is true (and I think it is), theres no right way to approach blogging if you want to be successful. There are plenty of people whove done a great job of it though, and I thought it would be useful to learn from them.These 16 bloggers shared one important tip each for blogging beginners. No doubt, even if youre not a beginner these tips will probably prove to be useful.1. Get ideas from your audienceCreate blog posts that answer the most interesting questions from people you engage with on social media. Dave Larson, founder of @tweetsmarterThis can be a great way to gather ideas of what topics people would most like to read about, which will help your blog grow! One of the best ways Ive seen this in action is through blog comments or Tweets. In one example, here on FastCompany a lot of people requested a post that features more women entrepreneurs:Now, a few weeks later adding such an article where just women contributed and built great businesses was a big hit:2. Understand your audienceUnderstand your audience better than they understand themselves. It takes a lot of upfront research, and often means being a member of the very tribe youre trying to lead  but it pays off. Brian Clark, founder and CEO, CopybloggerUnderstanding your audience better means youll have a better idea of what blog content will resonate with them, which is a good start when you get to writing blog posts.A great technique for doing this is to simply ask your readers first on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn with an engaging quote. If people respond well to it, than this is probably a great topic to write about. An example for this comes from Andrew Chen who famously tests his blogpost ideas on Twitter first.And so does Joel here at Buffer. Take this example from a recent Twitter post of his, where he simply tweeted one quote to see how well people liked a topic before he blogged about it:3. Write for yourself firstWrite for yourself first & foremost. Ignore the fact that anyone else will read what you write; just focus on your thoughts, ideas, opinions and figure out how to put those into words. Write it and they will come. Adii Pienaar, founder of PublicBetaAdiis experience in writing for himself firstly has made a difference to his blog in ways he didnt expect:Yes, since Ive been writing for myself, Ive found that I write more and I publish more often. I think though that the main reason for that is that I dont decide whether to publishing something based on the traction / reception that the post will receive within my audience; instead if I want to publish something, I do so. For myself.4. Build your email listStart building your email list from day one. Even if you dont plan on selling anything, having an email list allows you to promote your new content to your audience directly without worrying about search rankings, Facebook EdgeRank, or other online roadblocks in communications. Kristi Hines, freelance writer and professional bloggerWhen youre asking readers to sign up for your email list, you might want to try experimenting with different language. Willy Franzen found that his subscription rate jumped 254% higher when he changed his call-to-action from subscribe by email to get jobs by email:Using this phrase more clearly tells Willys readers what theyre signing up for, which clearly worked well!5. Love your existing readersLove the readers you already have. A lot of bloggers get quite obsessed with finding new readers  to the point that they ignore the ones they already have. Yes  do try to find new readers but spend time each day showing your current readers that you value them too and youll find that they will help you grow your blog. Darren Rowse, founder of ProBloggerFocusing on your readers is a great way to get to know them better (see tip #2). I love the way Daniel Burstein describes blog readers expectations of you as a blogger:A blog is really two things. One, simply a piece of technology, a platform. But, two, it is a promise in the minds of most readers, who expect that the blog should have actual content with some elements of value that is hyper-targeted to their needs. Much like with a newspaper. Readers dont just look at a newspaper as newsprint that is delivered on their driveway every morning. They look at it as valuable information about their city, where they live, and the things that they do.6. Focus on building an amazing call-to-actionI screwed up for years. Id blog and blog. Some of my posts were doing very well on places like Hacker News, but I had such hard time getting return visitors. And very few people bothered to follow me on Twitter. Dont rely on people to do the work to find your Twitter account. Dont rely on them to do the work to find your details in a sidebar. People are blind to sidebars. Thanks banner ads! Finish your blog post with some kind of call to action to signup for an email list or follow you on Twitter. When I started doing this, I immediately increased my Twitter followers by 335% in the first 7 days. Nate Kontny, founder of DraftNate uses a simple call-to-action on his blog now, that looks like this:This particular technique weve also tested here on the Buffer blog and found it to work amazingly well to bring attention to other blog posts weve written, like this:or to Buffer product features, like this:7. Give stuff awayGive away free content that adds value to peoples lives until it hurts and they will love you and become loyal fans. Jeff Bullas, blogger and author of Blogging the Smart WayA great example of this is the research done by Incentivibe, who found that adding a giveaway contest pop-up to the bottom-right of their website led to 125% more email subscribers.8. Be consistentConsistency is one of the most important things that bloggers tend to forget. Its much easier to lose your traffic than it is to build it up, so make sure you consistently blog. Neil Patel, founder of KISSmetricsA study by Hubspot showed that consistent blogging actually leads to higher subscriber growth rates:Over a two-month span, businesses that published blog entries on a regular basis (more than once a week) added subscribers over twice as fast as those companies that added content once a month.9. Give away your knowledgeDont be afraid to showcase what you know. Too many bloggers hold back the good stuff out of fear of giving away the secret sauce. There is no secret sauce in a world where everyone has high speed Internet access at all times. Today, you want to give away information snacks to sell knowledge meals. Jay Baer, author of YoutilityJays advice is to share the knowledge you have, rather than keeping it tucked away for a rainy day. Chris Guillebeau follows this advice by offering two free, downloadable PDFs to his readers. Chris also does what Jay calls giving away information snacks to sell knowledge meals. On both of the free PDF download pages, Chris markets his book on the right-hand side.10. Be true to your voiceStay true to yourself and your voice. People dont care to follow sites so much as they care to follow people. Chris Pirillo, founder and CEO, LockerGnomeAnother blogger who advocates the importance of the writers voice is Jeff Goins. He says that your voice is the most important, yet over-looked part of blogging:Writing isnt about picking the right topic; its about finding the right voice. What matters, what readers really resonate with, isnt so much what you say, but how.11. Give it time  This is whyPlan to invest in blogging for a long time before you see a return. The web is a big, noisy place and unless youre willing to invest more over a greater period of time than others, youll find success nearly impossible. If youre seeking short-term ROI, or a quick path to recognition, blogging is the wrong path. But if you can stick it out for years without results and constantly learn, iterate, and improve, you can achieve something remarkable. Rand Fishkin, CEO of MozRand shared these great images with us from his wifes travel blog, Everywhereist, which shows just how long it can take to see a return on your efforts:12. Give your email list priorityIf youre blogging to create a business, a movement, or to support a cause, then you need to build an email list. Its not an option. I dont even consider my blog to be my community, my email list is my community. Caring about these people, writing for them, and delivering value to them should be your number one goal. James Clear, entrepreneur, weightlifter and travel photographerWhen the New York Public Library focused on growing email subscription rates, this simple home page design with information about what readers could expect to receive boosted numbers by 52.8% over a more complicated version with less information about the actual newsletter:13. Write catchy headlinesNo matter how great your content is, it wont matter unless you have an amazing headline. People have a split second to decide if they should click on your post, and your headline will make them decide. The headline is also essential in making it easy and desirable for people to share your post. Keep your headlines SPUB: simple, powerful, useful and bold. Dave Kerpen, author and CEO of Likeable LocalSomething we do at Buffer is to test several different headlines for each of our blog posts to determine which ones works best. Heres an example of what that might look like:You can read more about this particular approach in more depth here: A scientific guide to writing great headlines on Twitter, Facebook and your Blog14. Be YourselfThere isnt one specific set of rules to be successful in blogging. When I started blogging, I had the opportunity to learn from experienced and successful bloggers in the industry. One of the best lessons Ive learned from them is to simply be me. I didnt have to be too professional or use big words to impress others. I had to simply be me. By being me, I enjoyed writing and the process more. It had me writing more than I usually would too. If you look at the the most successful writers like Seth Godin and Chris Brogan youll notice that they are different and unique in their own ways. Aaron Lee, social media manager, entrepreneur and bloggerMoz CEO Rand Fishkin agrees that telling your companys story is important, as opposed to following a formula for successful blogging:Emotion and storytelling have been part of how we communicate with each other and inspire action for thousands of years.15. Keep it shortBiggest lesson I learned in my past year of blogging. Keep it in the 12 minutes read-time length. Derek Sivers, founder of Wood EggWorking out the best length for your blog posts can be tricky. You generally need about 300 words minimum to get indexed by search engines, but otherwise the length of your post is up to what you think feels best.Derek Sivers noticed recently that his shorter posts were much better received by readers and seemed to be shared more, unlike his longer posts:When Ive written articles that were too long or had too many ideas, they didnt get much of a reaction. When I read books, I often feel bad for the brilliant idea buried on page 217. Who will hear it? Stop the orchestra. Solo that motif. Repeat it. Let the other instruments build upon it. The web is such a great way to do this. Present a single idea, one at a time, and let others build upon it.According to this Chartbeat graph below, many visitors to your site wont bother scrolling, and most visitors wont read more than about 60% of what youve written. Keeping it short and sharp then, could be worthwhile.If youre looking for a general guide to blog post length, Joe Pulizzis blog post, A blog post is like a miniskirt might be useful:A blog post is like a miniskirt. It has to be short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the subject.16. Make it worth referencing  here is how:One thing I always try to keep in mind before publishing a post is would anyone want to cite this for any reason? Just like interesting research is great because it leaves you with a fascinating finding or an idea, I like for my posts to be the same. That doesnt mean relying on research, but simply making sure each post has an original lesson or actionable item, making it citable on the web. Gregory Ciotti, marketing strategist at Help ScoutOur very own Buffer co-founder Leo has written about a similar thing before:When writing a post, I get into a mindset to answer just this 1 question with a Yes: Would anyone email this article to a friend? Its an extremely simple proposition. Yet, it has changed my writing completely. If I put myself into a readers head going through a post and seeing whether someone will say Oh, this is interesting, John will really like this, then I go ahead and publish it. Its almost like an invisible threshold to pass. I need to improve the post until this level is reached. I will iterate, find more research, get more examples, until I can truly imagine this happening.Im sure there are lots more great tips out there about building a blog.

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"It isnt just Canadians waiting to see tomorrows latest real estate numbers.On Wednesday when the Canadian Real Estate Association releases the latest sales statistics and prices for resale homes, it will feel like the whole world is watching.At the end of last month the Swiss banking giant UBS put both Toronto and Vancouver in the top five of its international bad boy list.Toronto had the distinction of placing number one on the companys worst global bubble risk, beating out Hong Kong, London and Amsterdam. Vancouver wasnt far behind.Fear of missing outAnnual price-increase rates of 10 per cent correspond to a doubling of house prices every seven years, which is not sustainable, said the UBS report. Nevertheless, the fear of missing out on further appreciation predominates among home buyers.If theres a bubble about to burst, nobodys convinced Canadian buyers or builders.A walk past a Toronto open house this weekend was like watching a sugar bowl attacked by ants. The interior of the newly renovated house glowed in the grey afternoon light like a film set as well-off looking couples dipped in for a taste and headed back to their expensive cars.Near a construction site, a real estate agency advertises its specialties including selling, renting and managing properties for absentee landlords. (Don Pittis/CBC)By the next day a sold sign indicated one set of lucky buyers was now likely saddled with a million-dollar mortgage.There may be some justification for bidding up the price of a detached brick house near good public transportation. The supply is limited.But not far away, construction cranes tower into the sky as workers build more condos. The builders insist they are selling.Montreal hot tooAnd Toronto and Vancouver arent the only hot spots. After provincial governments used a tax on foreign buyers to try to slow overseas demand in those two cities, Montreal has seen a condo sales explosion of its own.Powered by a surging Quebec economy that has made it a target for foreign cash diverted away from B.C. and Ontario, real estate in the provinces business capital is playing catch-up.In greater Montreal, homes sold more quickly in October as continued strong demand propelled average prices seven per cent higher. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)So why isnt the latest round of warnings, including one from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation that the Canadian market was highly vulnerable, having an effect?Certainly hot international money looking for a safe home must still be having an impact. For example, some analysts have pointed to a resurgence in overseas buying in Vancouver as investors find ways around the tax or merely chalk it up as a cost of doing business.Safer than bitcoinIf bitcoin, an imagined currency that has no floor value, can continue to attract investors in spite of this past weekends heart-stopping plunge and recovery, its no wonder overseas money thinks of Canadian property as a secure investment.Maybe its a sign of dangerous times to use bitcoin as a comparison, but if you are choosing between the two, Canadian property easily comes down as the blue chip investment. If the worst were to happen, bitcoins billions could disappear in a cloud of smoke, but Canadian homes would retain a long-term value.Whether its because investors are sitting on unrented properties or due to soaring domestic need, markets continue to show plenty of unsatisfied demand, especially in areas closer to city centres and near good public transit.Despite the warnings of the worst bubble risk in the world, Toronto contruction companies continue their residential building boom and they say they have yet to satisfy demand. (Don Pittis/CBC)Canadas surging economy continues to crank out good quality jobs and well-employed people demand quality accommodation. Besides, people hired in one of Canadas big cities need to find someplace to live whatever the price or quality.And even if a bubble were to pop and Canadian houses were to experience a real bear market, with a million new immigrants scheduled to arrive in the next three years, there is every reason to expect a long-term return to value.Cheap rates are getting expensiveAs UBS notes in its warning, fear of missing out continues to drive buyers, convinced from years of experience that property prices only go one way  up. Of course if they look back at about a decades worth of previous warnings they would quickly come to a conclusion warnings are not to be trusted.Perhaps most important for the prospective homeowner trying to get into this market is that borrowing to buy a house or condo remains dirt cheap. Floating rates remain in the order of two per cent and five-year fixed rates can be as little as three per cent a year.Those low rates are deceptive because houses are growing less affordable relative to income as prices continue to rise.Global inflation is weak and after, two recent increases, Canadian interest rate rises appear to be on hold, so Canadian buyers are getting very little discipline from the market.Until that happens  and despite the potential consequences  it is unlikely Canadian property buyers will be able to discipline themselves.

That was something we had never noticed before in 20 years of operation.The base of the lamp is all that is left after the pole was sheared off in high winds. (Randy McAndrew/CBC)In 2016, twenty light poles were replaced after one fixture was ripped from its base by extreme winds, falling onto the bridge.In 2015, high winds caused eleven lights to break off the structure.It was a northwest wind. They all fell on the other side in the strait and we never found them, LeChasseur said.Nobody reported them, they probably went with the ice in the spring.Looking for answersAfter the first poles were ripped off the bridge, LeChasseur turned to researchers at the University of Moncton for help with the problem.The first question, he said, was whether the poles were suffering from wear and tear, and potential metal fatigue from being exposed to the elements on the massive structure above the Northumberland Strait.We started with that, are they fatigued? said LeChasseur. The answer coming back from the chemists and the scientists is no, it is not fatigue.Researchers at the University of Moncton simulated high winds in the lab to test the lamp post and fixture. (Jean-Luc Bouchard/Radio-Canada)When it happened again in 2016, he went back to the research team to take a closer look at the LED light poles that had been installed in 2011.The light fixture is different than the previous model that was there from 97, said LeChasseur.Its lighter than the previous one, its more aerodynamic than the previous one, this seems like all good stuff but lets put it to the test.A potential solutionIn the research lab, the scientists came up with a potential solution: dampeners to reduce the sway of the poles.The dampener is a metal box containing two weighted balls.The dampener contains two weighted balls, with spikes on top to scare away the birds. (Randy McAndrew/CBC)It kills the momentum, kills the motion so it stays more steady, explained LeChasseur.Instead of swaying tremendously, it will sway less, the more you sway, the more risk that something will break.310 lightsThe process of installing the dampeners is underway now, as winds permit. Crews in bucket trucks install the boxes on top of the light posts.The scientists tested the dampeners in the research lab before coming up with the design to be used on the bridge. (Jean-Luc Bouchard/Radio-Canada)Strait Crossing is manufacturing the dampeners, which will cost about $15,000 for 310 lights, not including the months of research.The company will be monitoring the new dampeners and their effect on the light posts carefully over the winter.The maintenance crew for the Confederation Bridge is using bucket trucks to install dampeners on top of the lamp posts. (Randy McAndrew/CBC)Every time theres a wind event well be out there, checking whats going on, he said.Does it solve everything? The answer is it doesnt, because the problem is not the pole and the fixture, the problem is the wind.","Confederation Bridge adapts lamp posts to stop swaying, shearing off – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

Is a realistic complexion or an earnest gaze the key to seeing artificial beings as more than, well, artificial?Thats the premise behind BabyX, the lifelike virtual infant from the New Zealand-based research group Soul Machines, whose goal is to humanize artificial intelligence (AI). The groups work is in many ways unprecedented as they develop robots that emulate not only human gestures but also actual human functioning.But it also raises a question: Is human likeness something that we want from our machine counterparts? Or, conversely, does it make humans slightly nervous when artificial beings look too much like us?Meet BabyXBabyX is a hyper-realistic screen-based simulation of an infant, with rosy cheeks and wide, sparkling eyes. Its lifelike appearance is a result of both art and engineering.Soul Machines founder, Mark Sagar, is an award-winning special effects artist who has worked in digital character creation for blockbuster films like Avatar and King Kong. He has developed a unique appreciation for the minutiae of human expression. In that way, the computer-generated people he creates are in a league of their own, with appearances and movements that are remarkably close to those of humans.And that is no small feat. After all, its one thing to look human, but its a whole other thing to move realistically, explains Michael Walters, a senior lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire.Its very difficult to get a robot to not just look right but move right, as well, says Walters, who is also a researcher with the universitys multidisciplinary Adaptive Systems Research Group.Weve seen various humanoid robots, but we arent fooled by them for very long. Theyre close but not quite right.Sagars team at Soul Machines is working to make virtual beings that are persuasively lifelike  not just in how they look but in how they move and react to stimuli. Thats due in large part to the way theyre approaching this 21st -century challenge: theyre endeavouring to build a simulated brain.Finding the human connectionAn interdisciplinary team that includes neuroscientists and physiologists is now building biologically inspired models of the human brain, using the concepts of neural networks and machine learning to build a virtual nervous system, says Greg Cross, Soul Machines chief business officer.Their goal, he says, is to understand how humans work, and figure out how we learn to interact with others, and how we learn to create. When their autonomous virtual infant smiles, its not because of a line of code directing it to do so following certain prompts or inputs  its in reaction to virtual dopamine and endorphins, the release of which is triggered by real-world stimuli and interactions. In other words, the same things that make humans smile.By putting a face on machines they become more human-like, says Cross. The most powerful instrument we have to show our emotions is the human face.Soul Machines team of developers is striving to reach the benchmarks of emotional intelligence, understanding and responding to emotion, he added.In this way, the research group is differentiating their creations from the current wave of consumer robots on the market. Cross sees their AI as the inevitable evolution of the faceless virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa that are now in millions of homes and businesses all over the world.Humanoid robots are to virtual assistants what television was to radio, he says.Uncanny valleyThe assumption is that consumers actually want robots as their digital doppelgangers. But do we?Despite our fascination with lifelike robots and AI, to date, the answer to that question has been mixed. Coined by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori, the uncanny valley is a term for the discomfort we feel around man-made creations that look human. While these virtual characters can elicit a sense of familiarity, as they attempt  but fail  to mimic human behaviours, they tend to also trigger a sense of uneasiness, or even revulsion, among observers.Its unclear whether humans unease with lifelike robots will dissipate as AI develops. (Alastair Grant/Associated Press)Walters suspects the feeling of uncanny valley will disappear over time as people grow more accustomed to interacting with humanoid robots and simulations. He also sees this as the advantage of voice-based virtual assistants. After all, he says, talking is relatively easy to do, and the latest speech synthesizers sound very realistic.The other advantage of the current generation of faceless AI, says Walters, is that people have a desire for robots to behave with consistency. In other words, the more it looks like us, the more we expect it to be capable of doing. In that sense, because Siri and Alexa are just disembodied voices, we are more willing to cut them some slack  a necessity at this still early stage of consumer adoption, when these consumer-facing AI are still buggy and flawed.When it comes to our adoption of humanoid robots, Walters says, we are chasing a moving target. The eerie-ness of the uncanny valley will likely ease as time passes and we grow more accustomed to lifelike machines in our midst, he says.And so, as BabyX grows up over the coming decade, consumers might also grow more open to the likes of Soul Machines robots.When it comes to the widespread adoption of these lifelike AI, its uncertain what will evolve more quickly: our acceptance of this next generation of humanoid simulations, or the technological capability to actually realistically render them.",Virtual infant BabyX prompts question: how do we feel about AI that looks so much like us? – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Most of the increase came from China.The report by the Global Carbon Project team dashed hopes that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas had peaked.We hoped that we had turned the corner We havent, said study co-author Rob Jackson, an Earth scientist at Stanford University.Carbon dioxide emissions rose steadily and slowly starting in the late 1880s with the Industrial Revolution, then took off dramatically in the 1950s. In the last three years, levels had stabilized at about 36.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (40 billion tons).A bit staggeringEstimates for 2017 put it at about 37 billion metric tonnes (40.8 billion tons). Sixty years ago , the world spewed only 8.3 billion tonnes (9.2 billion tons).Its a bit staggering, said co-author Ralph Keeling, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, noting in an email that levels have increased fourfold since he was born in the 1950s. We race headlong into the unknown.Man-made carbon dioxide is causing more than 90 per cent of global warming since 1950, U.S. scientists reported this month.People wearing masks cycle past Tiananmen Gate during the smog after a red alert was issued for heavy air pollution in Beijing, China, December 20, 2016.

Declines in the United States (0.4 per cent) and Europe (0.2 per cent) were smaller than previous years. India, the No. 3 carbon polluting nation, went up 2 per cent.The 2017 estimate comes to on average of 1.16 million kilograms (2.57 million pounds) of carbon dioxide spewing into the air every second.The study was published Monday and is being presented in Bonn, Germany, during climate talks where leaders are trying to come up with rules for the 2015 Paris deal.

(Although evidence of a grog made of fermented grapes, hawthorne berries, honey and rice beer has been found in Jiahu, China, from as far back as 7000 BC.)A Neolithic jar, possibly used for storing wine, from the site of Khramis Didi Gora, sits on display at the Georgian National Museum. It holds about 60 litres. Fragments from the bottom of a similar vessel have tested positive for the chemical signatures of wine  the oldest such evidence in the world. (Judyta Olszewski)The new discovery is exciting for a lot of reasons, says Stephen Batiuk, a senior research associate in the Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations and the Archeology Centre at the University of Toronto.If youre talking to a wine enthusiast, they love the idea we can push the history of this beverage so far. Us archeologists, were interested in the human element of it, he told CBC News in an interview.Batiuk noted that agriculture first started in northern Iraq, northern Syria and southern Turkey, and needed to adapt to different environmental conditions when it spread to places like Georgia, Turkeys northern neighbour.To see how we humans adapted and what new products we developed is actually kind of a fun and fascinating thing. And the fact that it was wine and alcohol  I think it says about a lot about human nature.Ancient villagesScientists had previously found possible evidence of wine residues at a site called Shulaveris Gora, located about 50 kilometres south of the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.Batiuk, who had previously studied the spread of wine culture across western Asia and the Middle East, was invited to work with the Georgian National Museum to look for further evidence at both that site and a nearby site called Gadachrili Gora.Domestic grapes produce a lot more fruit than wild grapes because theyre hermaphrotidic, with male and female organs on the same flower, so they can self-pollinate. Wild grape flowers are either male or female, so only half the flowers produce fruit, and only if they have been pollinated by insects or wind. (Shutterstock / Dasha Petrenko)During the last part of the Stone Age, known as the Neolithic, those sites were villages of densely packed circular mud-brick homes, each about one to five metres in diameter, interspersed with pits and courtyards. The villages would have been nested in a forested river valley partially surrounded hills and, further away, the snow-capped Caucasus mountains.Each was spread over an area about the size of an international soccer field and was home to less than 100 people, Batiuk estimates.I believe I was dancing like a little stick figure under the vines.  Stephen Batiuk, University of TorontoThey would have grown wheat to make bread. They likely also grew fruit and nut trees. They raised sheep, goats and cattle for meat and milk, and fished in the local stream.Batiuk and his team hunted for fragments of clay pottery from the bottoms of large storage jars that looked like they might still have some residue stuck to them and sent them to the lab of Patrick McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania for analysis. McGovern used several chemical techniques to look for the fingerprints of the characteristic components of wine  in particular, tartaric acid, which only found in high levels in grapes and not other fruits in the region.While the technique cant detect whether grape juice was fermented, the researchers noted that it naturally ferments to wine in several days in the temperate climate in that part of Georgia because the yeast that causes fermentation is always found on some grape skins.In 2015, the first year the Batiuk worked on excavations in the region, none of the samples tested positive for wine.But in 2016 and 2017, the team worked extra hard to find good samples and they got some good news back.I believe I was dancing like a little stick figure under the vines, Batiuk said with a laugh.The team published their results on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Not a redThe residues were yellowish, Batiuk said, suggesting that the wine was a white and not a red.He and his colleagues believe it was made from domesticated grapes, but they havent been able prove that yet because they havent yet been able to find any preserved grape seeds at the archeological sites.Domestic grapes produce a lot more fruit than wild grapes because theyre hermaphroditic, with male and female organs on the same flower, so they can self-pollinate. Wild grape flowers are either male or female, so only half the flowers produce fruit, and only if they have been pollinated by insects or wind.This is base of a neolithic jar being prepared for sampling for residue analysis. (Judyta Olszewski)Batiuk says just from the sheer volume alone of wine that the Neolithic Georgians seemed to be producing, he thinks they would have had to have been growing domesticated grapes. He added that there are 540 different varieties of domestic grapes in that region, suggesting domestication would have to have happened about 8,000 years ago to allow enough time to breed so many kinds.Besides the U.S., Georgia and Canada, the study also included researchers from France, Italy, Israel and Denmark.

The firm estimates that the gen-three version accounted for just 800,000 shipments, due to supply issues, which bodes well for Apple coming into the lucrative holiday season.That figure was a big jump on 2.8 million shipments one year previous. It also gave Apple 23 percent of the market, putting it fractionally ahead of the 21 percent for Xiaomi, the Chinese firm that was briefly top of the industry for the first time in the previous quarter.Apples wearable division has enjoyed something of a renaissance this year, grabbing the top spot in Q1 for overall wearables the first time since Q3 2015. CEO Tim Cook said in Apples most recent earnings report that Watch sales were up by 50 percent for the third consecutive quarter thanks to a focus on health services.As for the others: Fitbit took third in Q3 2017 for 20 percent, while phone makers Huawei (six percent) and Samsung (five percent) were some way behind in rounding out the top five. In proof of considerable fragmentation within the industry, other brands accounted for a dominant 25 percent, according to Canalys figures.Q3 is traditionally the years weakest period for wearable sales  since many consumer hold off on large ticket items until the Christmas period  but Canalys said the top vendors were all up on the previous quarter.

More than 400 people were killed and more than 7,000 were injured.They searched for survivors Monday, and found many more of the dead. The earthquake struck at night, burying people beneath their own homes, CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports.The quake jolted the city of Erbil in Iraq, around 130 miles from the epicenter. The shockwaves were still strong enough to spark panic.But the worst damage was in a poor and mountainous region in Iran that hugs the border with Iraq. Now, 70,000 people are reportedly in need of emergency shelter, just as winter is closing in.Iran is criss-crossed by fault lines and has grown used to deadly quakes. The worst ones have killed tens of thousands. But thats no comfort for people who are left with just the rubble of their homes.A wall turned over on me, a young boy told Williams, it fell on me.Residents fled into the streets as the quake struck, without time to grab their possessions, as apartment complexes collapsed into rubble. Outside walls of some complexes were sheared off by the quake, power and water lines were severed, and telephone service was disrupted.Residents dug frantically through wrecked buildings for survivors as they wailed. Firefighters from Tehran joined other rescuers in the desperate search, using dogs to inspect the rubble.The hospital in Sarpol-e-Zahab was heavily damaged, and the army set up field hospitals, although many of the injured were moved to other cities, including Tehran.It also damaged an army garrison and buildings in the border city and killed an unspecified number of soldiers, according to reports.Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei immediately dispatched all government and military forces to aid those affected.Many of the heavily damaged complexes in Sarpol-e-Zahab were part of construction projects under former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The newly homeless slept outside in cold, huddled around makeshift fires for warmth, wrapped in blankets  as were the dead.The quake killed 407 people in Iran and injured 7,156 others, Irans crisis management headquarters spokesman Behnam Saeedi told state TV. Most of the injuries were minor, he said, with fewer than 1,000 still hospitalized.Iranians mourn over the body of a victim following a 7.3-magnitude earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab in Irans western province of Kermanshah, Nov. 13, 2017. GettyThe semi-official Tasnim news agency reported 445 dead and 7,370 injured. There was no immediate explanation of the discrepancy, although double-counting of victims is common during such disasters in Iran.The official death toll came from provincial forensic authorities based on death certificates issued. Some reports said authorities have warned that unauthorized burials without certification could mean the death toll was actually higher.In Iraq, the earthquake killed at least seven people and injured 535 others, all in the countrys northern, semiautonomous Kurdish region, according to its Interior Ministry.The disparity in the fatality figures immediately drew questions from Iranians, especially because so much of the town was new.The earthquake struck 14.4 miles, or 23.2 kilometers, below the surface, a shallow depth that can have broader damage. Magnitude 7 earthquakes on their own are capable of widespread, heavy damage.The quake caused Dubais skyscrapers to sway and could be felt 1,060 kilometers, about 660 miles, away on the Mediterranean coast. Nearly 120 aftershocks followed.Kokab Fard, a 49-year-old housewife in Sarpol-e-Zahab, said she could only flee empty-handed when her apartment complex collapsed.Immediately after I managed to get out, the building collapsed, Fard said. I have no access to my belongings.Reza Mohammadi, 51, said he and his family ran into the alley following the first shock.I tried to get back to pick some stuff, but it totally collapsed in the second wave, Mohammadi said.Khamenei offered his condolences as President Hassan Rouhanis office said Irans elected leader would tour the damaged areas Tuesday, which was declared a national day of mourning. Authorities also set up relief camps and hundreds lined up to donate blood in Tehran, though some on state TV complained about the slowness of aid coming.",More than 400 killed in earthquake near Iran-Iraq border – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"More than 15,000 scientists around the world have issued a global warning: there needs to be change in order to save Earth.It comes 25 years after the first notice in 1992 when a mere 1,500 scientists issued a similar warning.This new cautioning  which gained popularity on Twitter with #ScientistsWarningToHumanity  garnered more than 15,000 signatures.William Ripple of Oregon State Universitys College of Forestry, who started the campaign, said that he came across the 1992 warning last February, and noticed that this year happened to mark the 25th anniversary.Together with his graduate student, Christopher Wolf, he decided to revisit the concerns raised then, and collect global data for different variables to show trends over the past 25 years.Ripple found:A decline in freshwater availability.Unsustainable marine fisheries.Ocean dead zones.Forest losses.Dwindling biodiversity.Climate change.Population growth.There was one positive outcome, however: a rapid decline in ozone depletion.The trends are alarming, and they speak for themselves, Ripple said, though he notes the improvement in the ozone hole illustrates that humanity can make change when needed.After writing the viewpoint article, which was accepted for publication in the journal BioScience, he decided to see if he could once again collect signatures.Id never tried that before, so in July I sent [the article] to 40 colleagues of mine, and by the next day, 600 scientists had signed it, he told CBC News.Almost 1900 scientists have signed the second #ScientistsWarningToHumanity Lets hit 5000 by the end of the week: https://t.co/20FLOjbzqwpic.twitter.com/fhAPcC6yfE  @NewsomeTMWithin two days, there were 1,200 signatures. Of the more than 15,364 signatures to date, 527 are from Canada, ranking eighth among 184 countries.The goal of the paper is to raise awareness about the fragile state of the planet.The scientists around the world are very concerned about the state of the world, the environmental situation and climate change, Ripple said. So this allows them to have a collective voice.Growing middle class and its carbon footprintSince 1992, carbon emissions have increased 62 per cent, Ripple said. And the global average temperature change has paralleled that. Also since 1992, we have two billion more people on Earth, which is a 35 per cent increase.However, he notes that there has been a rapid decline in fertility rates, but said that likely wont show up in the data until later.One of the chief concerns is population growth, but not in terms of numbers. Instead, the focus is on our ecological footprint with an increase in consumerism that puts a toll on the environment.Among the concerns scientists have about the environment is urban development and the threat it poses to biodiversity. (Steve Dodrill/Oregon State University)What is happening is that the global middle class is growing, and its growing extremely rapidly, said co-author Eileen Crist, a professor at Virginia Techs Department of Science and Technology in Society.That comes from the very positive outcome of getting people out of poverty. But theres a catch.But what sometimes people miss  they miss whats happening in the middle, Crist said. Which from an ecological perspective of the planet is the most significant event: the rapid rise of the global middle class, which is now more than three billion people in the world and its expected, by 2050 or so, to rise to five billion people.And its the middle class where people begin to increase their carbon footprint: they buy appliances and cars, eat more meat and travel.The chief concern isnt really the human numbers. Its the impact we have.  Eileen Crist, professor at Virginia TechOne of the potential solutions is to stabilize the population. If we reduce family size, consumption patterns dont rise as much. And that can be done by empowering girls and women, providing sexual education and education on family planning.The chief concern isnt really the human numbers as such. Its the impact we have, Crist said.In the throes of a mass extinction eventThere is rising evidence that Earth has entered the sixth mass extinction event brought on by humans.We are in the throes of a mass extinction event that is anthropogenic, Crist said. This is not something we can fix. If we lose 50 to 75 per cent of the species on the planet in this century  which is what scientists are telling us what will occur if we continue to operate as business-as-usual  if this happens, this can not be fixed.When asked whether shes optimistic that the new petition will have an effect on changes, Crist said that she doesnt think of it that way. Taking care of the planet is akin to taking care of ones family.We take care of our families: our children and our spouses and our parents. When you take care of your family, you dont do it because youre optimistic or pessimistic  its because thats what you do.Our mandate is that we take care of Earth and earthlings and human beings because were all family.","More than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries issue ‘warning to humanity’ – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

When the story first broke last Thursday, McConnell had said Moore should step aside if the allegations were true.Another Alabama woman came forward at an emotional news conference with high-profile attorney Gloria Allred a few hours after McConnells comments to accuse Moore of sexual assault.Beverly Young Nelson said she was terrified during an incident she said occurred when she was 16.I dont even know the womanMoore called a news conference in Gallant, Ala., after the new allegations were made public.I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I dont even know the woman, Moore said.He signalled he has no intention of ending his candidacy, calling the latest charges a political manoeuvre and launching a fundraising appeal to God-fearing conservatives.Beverly Nelson, left, reads a statement to reporters with lawyer Gloria Allred during a news conference in New York on Monday, announcing new allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama Republican congressional candidate Roy Moore. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)Nelson said she was working at a restaurant and that Moore, then the district attorney for Etowah County, was a regular customer.The alleged assault occurred when she accepted a ride from Moore. Nelson said he stopped the car in a dark area and proceeded to grope her breasts and force her head towards his torso.I thought he was going to rape me, she said. Nelson was able to fend him off, she said, and was left in the area to find her own way home.I thought he was going to rape me: Alabama woman talks about Roy Moore4:44She said she suffered severe bruising on her neck and soon quit her restaurant job in order to avoid Moore.Moore had emphasized no one would believe her if she came forward, stressing she was a a child. Nelson said at various points later in her life she told her sister, mother and husband about the incident.Nelson stressed that she voted for Donald Trump in last years election, hoping to pre-empt criticism that her story was politically motivated.Allred said Nelson is willing to testify under oath at any Senate judiciary committee called to investigate the Moore allegations.Moore called the accusations a witch hunt in a statement released shortly before the news conference. He has said he plans to file a lawsuit over the initial Post report that has threatened to derail his Senate bid.While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Ala., gym that the article was fake news and a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.Politically motivated accusations, Moore saysMoore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are untrue and said the newspaper will be sued, drawing a round of applause. The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be levelled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life.Why would they come now? Because there are groups that dont want me in the United States Senate, he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources.Moore hits back at allegations in Washington Post report Moore, too, has tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch that the vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.McConnell, questioned at a tax event in Louisville on Monday, said a write-in effort by another candidate was a possibility.Thats an option were looking at  whether or not there is someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully, McConnell said. Asked specifically about Luther Strange, the loser to Moore in a party primary, he said, Well see.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said he believes the women who have come forward to accuse Roy Moore. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)Strange was backed by Trump in the primary race, while Moore received support from former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.Doug Jones, the Democratic Party candidate in Alabamas Senate race, says that Republican Roy Moore will be held accountable by the people of Alabama.In a Jones campaign statement issued Monday, the courage of Moores accusers was applauded.Moore and Jones face a Dec. 12 special election to replace Strange, who was appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when Sessions was named U.S. attorney general.Mosts of the public opinion polls that were conducted since the Washington Post story was published show Moore leading.Senate could expel Moore if he runs, winsEven if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning.Should Moore still win, the head of the Senate Republican campaign committee said Monday the Senate should vote to expel him.Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said in a statement that he believes the women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct and that they spoke with courage and truth.I have now read Mr. Moores statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges. I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama.  @SenatorCollinsGardner said what they recounted proves Moore is unfit to serve in the Senate and should not run for office.Prior to the Nelson news conference, Alabamas governor was still on Moores side. Kay Ivey said Monday she plans to vote for Moore, but added that there may be some more facts to come out.Moore, 70, courted controversy long before the recent allegations. The former chief justice of Alabama urged judges to defy a Supreme Court on gay marriage, said he believed former president Barack Obama is not U.S.-born, and once wrote an op-ed stating that Democrat Keith Ellison shouldnt take the congressional oath because he is a practising Muslim.While Moore has called the allegations completely false and misleading, in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, Not generally, no.The situation has stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Sessions. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans already slim 52-48 majority. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate Republicans under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations.",‘I thought that he was going to rape me’: New Roy Moore accuser comes forward – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

(Jamal Saidi/Reuters)If the aim of Hariris interview was putting his riled-up people at ease, it didnt quite work.My impression is that he was speaking under considerable duress, it was quite evident in both his body language and just the general look on his face, said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, echoing an untold number of Lebanese who took to the internet to say the same.So even as Hariri insisted he would be home within days thanks to swift domestic and international pressure, according to the countrys relieved president  Lebanon finds itself again dangerously at the mercy of the old Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalry, and again facing the prospect of a new conflict.Odd circumstancesWatchers suspect the odd circumstances may have been born out of Saudi Arabias millennial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his revved up foreign policy, one clearly aimed at actively countering Irans growing influence, helped in no small part by its successes in Syria.The result though is only the newest episode in which the eternally divided Lebanon plays an old role it is never really allowed to abandon  that of a hapless battleground to greater powers.That means despite the precarious political balance that Hariri helped achieve in the past year  and despite the flash of unity Lebanese demonstrated over his disappearance  the old differences could easily be manipulated into bubbling back.Hariri shakes hands with Saudi Arabias King Salman in Riyadh on Nov. 11, 2017, in this photo provided by the Saudi Royal Court. (Saudi Royal Court via Reuters)Saad Hariri is, after all, the son of an assassinated prime minister, a crime in which the accused are believed to be members of Hezbollah, the only group in Lebanon to hold onto its arms after the civil war ended with his fathers help.The Hariris have always had close tries to Saudi Arabia  including citizenship.There is also Hezbollahs dual military and political role, and for many Lebanese, its highly controversial part in the Syrian war.Hezbollah is aligned with and supported financially and materially by Iran.If as critics see it, Saudi Arabia has indeed pushed Hariri to resign claiming his own life was in danger, it would be an awkwardly blunt attempt at using that history to check Irans influence.Delicate balanceBut Hariris, indeed Lebanons, experience advises against singlehandedly upsetting the delicate political balance in the country.His fathers killing and Hezbollahs terrifyingly swift takeover of Beirut in 2008 showed the dangerous consequences of doing so.So, in his own words, Hariri put aside some fundamental disagreements with Hezbollah to include them in his coalition government last year.Lebanese women hold placards supporting Hariri during the Beirut marathon on Nov. 12, 2017. (Hassan Ammar/Associated Press)It is still speculation, but it is plausible that Hariris refusal to adopt a more antagonistic stance likely turned Saudi Arabia against him and  as his supporters believe  pushed Riyadh to hold him against his will.But after a slew of statements from the U.S., France, Britain and other countries backing Hariri this past week, Saudi Arabia appears to be backing off ever so slightly where Lebanon is concerned. There also appears to have been a shift in Hariris tone since his resignation  though to those who know him, none of it sounds anything like him.He even suggested he might rescind his resignation depending on talks once he returns home.Backdoor channelsHariri said repeatedly the only way for tiny Lebanon to maintain stability is to hold onto a policy of neutrality.In other words, for Hezbollah to stay out of the regions conflicts.But he restricted his comments to Hezbollahs alleged role in Yemens conflict.This opens the door for backdoor channels between Iran and Saudi Arabia to try and calm the situation, because I think any more escalation can basically send the whole region into flames, said Yahya.An escalation in Lebanon would not be limited to Lebanon. Once a conflict starts, its very hard to control.Saudi Arabia had accused Lebanon of declaring war when a Yemeni missile landed near the Riyadh airport last week. Without Hariri in a coalition government, Saudi Arabia could effectively equate Lebanon with Hezbollah.In turn, Hezbollah accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war by putting Hariri under house arrest.In other words, Lebanon is once again at the cusp of another war.The question is what form it might ultimately take.Economic warSaudi Arabia could strike back militarily as it has in Yemen. It also wouldnt be difficult for Saudi Arabia, or Iran, to arm local groups and encourage civil violence.Riyadh has already waged an economic war by urging all its citizens to leave tourism-reliant Lebanon. All Arab Gulf countries have similar bans that they reiterated last week.But Saudi Arabia could bring Lebanon to its knees with an economic blockade, or worse, sending the tens of thousands of Lebanese who work in the Arab Gulf region home  a scenario Hariri raised as a possibility on Sunday.Lebanon cannot afford to declare a war against anybody.  WalidJumblattWhatever form this new conflict now takes  and even if Hariri does indeed make it home this week  Lebanon simply isnt equipped to cope.It probably cant withstand too many more surprises without dissolving into its usual fractious self.We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt told Reuters.Lebanon cannot afford to declare a war against anybody.",Lebanon again dangerously at mercy of Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalry: Nahlah Ayed – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

JONATHAN ERNST / REUTERSSpeaking ahead of the handshake, Duterte said the ASEAN meetings will present an excellent opportunity for us to engage in meaningful discussion on matters of regional and international importance. He highlighted the recent battle against ISIS in Marawi.For example, terrorism and violent extremism endanger the peace, stability and security of our region because these threats know no boundaries, Duterte said. Piracy and armed robbery and disease put a dent on our growth and disrupt the stability of both regional and global commerce, he said. The menace of illegal gun trade continues to endanger the very fabric of our societies. These and other issues are high on the agenda of our meetings, along with the other nontraditional security issues that challenge the prosperity of our economies, integrity of institutions, and more importantly, the safety of our people.Duterte sparred with former President Obama in the past, vowing to say son of a bitch I will swear at you ahead of a meeting at a summit last year.Rights groups have long accused Duterte of involvement in death squads. He has denied the claims, even while engaging in tough talk in which he stated his approach to criminals was to kill them all.Mr. Trump will also meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, which plays a key role in the U.S. vision of an Indo-Pacific region that attempts to de-emphasize Chinas influence. And he will meet with Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull, with whom he had a contentious phone call this spring.Mr. Trumps discussions will largely center on trade and North Korea but he remains dogged by things he has said, and not said, about Russia.He tried to have it both ways on the issue of Russian interference in last years presidential race, saying he believes both the U.S. intelligence agencies when they say Russia meddled and Putins sincerity in claiming that his country did not.I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election, Mr. Trump said Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam.As to whether I believe it, Im with our agencies, Mr. Trump said. As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.But just a day earlier, he had lashed out at the former heads of the U.S. intelligence agencies, dismissing them as political hacks and claiming there were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings that Russia meddled to help Mr. Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Former CIA director John Brennan, appearing Sunday on CNNs State of the Union with former national intelligence director James Clapper, said Trump was deriding them in an attempt to delegitimize the intelligence communitys assessment.I think Mr. Putin is very clever in terms of playing to Mr. Trumps interest in being flattered. And also I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do or what might come out as a result of these investigations, Brennan said.Clapper called the threat from Russia manifest and obvious.To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding and, in fact, poses a peril to this country, he said on CNN.Brennan said Mr. Trumps ambiguity on Russias involvement was very, very worrisome from a national security standpoint.I think hes giving Putin a pass and I think it demonstrates to Putin that Donald Trump can be played by foreign leaders who are going to appeal to his ego and play upon his insecurities, Brennan said.Questions about whether Mr. Trump believes the assessment about Russian election-meddling have trailed him since January, when he said for the first time, shortly before taking office, that he accepted that Russia was behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race.A special counsels examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Mr. Trump campaign aides so far has led to indictments against Mr. Trumps former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Mr. Trump foreign policy adviser for lying to the FBI.Multiple congressional committees are also investigating.Mr. Trump told reporters traveling with him to Hanoi on Saturday that Putin had again vehemently denied the allegations. The two spoke during an economic conference in Danang, Vietnam. Trump danced around questions about whether he believed Putin but stressed Putins denials.Every time he sees me, he says: I didnt do that. And I believe  I really believe  that when he tells me that, he means it, Mr. Trump said, arguing that it makes no sense for him to belabor the issue when Russia could help the U.S. on North Korea, Syria and other issues.Mr. Trump was originally slated to depart Manila for Washington on Monday. He added a day to the schedule amid criticism that he would have missed the final summit.","Philippine president Duterte kicks off Asian summit, shakes hands with Trump – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

Four North Korean soldiers fired 40 rounds at a comrade fleeing south and hit him five times in the first shootout at the jointly controlled area of the heavily fortified border between the rivals since 1984, South Koreas military said Tuesday (Photo by LEE JIN-MAN / AP)SEOUL, South Korea  Four North Korean soldiers fired about 40 rounds at a comrade fleeing into South Korea and hit him five times in the first shooting at the jointly controlled area of the heavily fortified border in more than 30 years, the Souths military said Tuesday.South Korean soldiers did not fire their weapons, but Mondays incident occurred at a time of high animosity over North Koreas nuclear program. The North has expressed intense anger over past high-profile defections.The soldier is being treated at a South Korean hospital after a five-hour operation for the gunshot wounds he suffered during his escape across the Joint Security Area. His personal details and motive for defection are unknown and his exact medical condition is unclear.ADVERTISEMENTSouth Koreas military said he suffered injuries in his internal organs but wasnt in a life-threatening condition.But the Ajou University Medical Center near Seoul said the soldier was relying on a breathing machine after the surgery removed the bullets. Lee Guk-jong, a doctor who leads Ajous medical team for the soldier, described his patients condition as very dangerous and said the next 10 days might determine whether he recovers.On Monday, he first drove a military jeep but left the vehicle when one of its wheels fell into a ditch. He then fled across the JSA, with fellow soldiers chasing and firing at him, South Koreas military said, citing unspecified surveillance systems installed in the area.Suh Wook, chief director of operations for the Souths Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers that North Korea fired a total of about 40 rounds in a shooting that his office suggested started while the soldier was in the jeep.The solider was found beneath a pile of leaves on the southern side of the JSA and South Korean troops crawled there to recover him. A UN Command helicopter later transported him to the Ajou medical center, according to South Korean officials.The Norths official media havent reported the case as of Tuesday afternoon. They have previously accused South Korea of kidnapping or enticing North Koreans to defect. About 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea, mostly via China, since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.The JSA is jointly overseen by the American-led UN Command and by North Korea, with South Korean and North Korean border guards facing each other only meters apart. It is located inside the 4-kilometer-wide (2 1/2-mile-wide) Demilitarized Zone, which forms the de facto border between the Koreas since the Korean War.While both sides of the DMZ are guarded by barbed wire fences, mines and tank traps, the JSA includes the truce village of Panmunjom which provides the site for rare talks and draws curious tourists.ADVERTISEMENTMondays incident was the first shooting at the Joint Security Area since North Korean and UN Command soldiers traded gunfire when a Soviet citizen defected by sprinting to the South Korean sector of the JSA in 1984. A North Korean soldier defected there in 1998 and another in 2007 but neither of those events involved gunfire between the rivals, according to South Koreas military.The 1984 exchange of gunfire happened after North Korean soldiers crossed the border and fired, according to the UN Command. In Mondays incident, it wasnt known if the North continued firing after the defector was officially in the southern part of the Joint Security Area. The UN Command said Tuesday that an investigation into the incident was underway.The Joint Security Area was the site of some bloodshed during the Cold War but there hasnt been major violence there in recent years. In 1976, North Korean soldiers axed two American army officers to death and the United States responded by flying nuclear-capable B-52 bombers toward the DMZ in an attempt to intimidate the North.","Seoul: N.

(Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)The Stoney Nations, descendants of the Sioux, include three bands with the largest reserve west of Calgary.They have been suing the province and the federal government over their aboriginal and treaty rights, including land and resources, in a complex case that was originally filed in 2003.The claim covers a big part of southern Alberta and the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.Douglas Rae, a lawyer for the First Nations, said the name change application is not part of the lawsuit, but an attempt by the bands to prove their ties to the land.The Stoneys are asserting their rights, and good evidence of these claims is to formally ask for recognition of the Stoney Nakoda names, Rae said.Some of the proposed name changes are fairly literal translations.Bow River is Ijathibe WaptaElder Wallace Ear said the word for Bow River is Ijathibe Wapta, a place where people made bows out of Saskatoon saplings.They are also suggesting Mini Thni Wapta as an alternative, which means cold river, a description that wont surprise anyone who has ever tipped a canoe in the Bow.The proposal for Canmore  Chuwapchipchiyan Kude Bi  has no direct connection to its existing moniker. The town was named Canmore in the 1880s by a railway official after an ancient king of Scotland.Elder Frank Powderface said the Stoney name reflects a hunter who fooled himself by shooting at what he thought was a wolf in the willows, but there was no animal, only willows.Albertas Geographical Names Program has never before dealt with such an extensive list of requested changes.Public consultations plannedRon Kelland, program co-ordinator, said the application will be evaluated in a process that will include public consultations. Researchers will look at old maps and historical documents.We are in the early stages of looking at it and we are very much looking forward to engaging the Stoney Nakoda on these names, he said.Final decisions on naming natural geographical features are made by the Alberta Historical Resources Foundation and the government.Changing community names is up to the province, but requests that involve First Nations must be presented to Ottawa.Kelland said its possible for a natural location to have both an official and a traditional name.In 1984, the province changed the name of Mount Laurie west of Calgary to also include its Stoney Nakoda traditional name Iyamnathka, which means flat-surfaced rock or mountain.","If First Nations group gets its wish, Calgary will be renamed Wichispa Oyade – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

(Czarek Sokolowski/Associated Press)Agnieszka Markiewicz, director of AJCs Warsaw Central Europe office in Warsaw, said the holiday was seriously marred by hateful, far-right throngs that threaten the core values of Poland and its standing abroad.The apparent tolerance shown for these purveyors of hate  and, lets be clear, thats exactly what they are  by some Polish government officials is particularly troubling, Markiewicz said.Jonny Daniels, head of the Jewish organization From the Depths, which has worked closely with the right-wing government in Poland and is seen as sympathetic to it, expressed his shock at events and asked prosecutors in Warsaw to investigate whether criminal acts of racism had been committed.Each one of these individuals would have been filmed by media and city monitoring, Daniels said. There is no excuse for these people not to be easily found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.He said that acts and words expressed Saturday can easily lead to violence, unrest and have already placed a feeling of unease with minorities in Poland and all decent peace-loving Poles.","Polish government defends far-right rally that drew 60,000 – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, the Judiciary Committees Republican chairman.The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd did not say what specific steps might be taken by the Justice Department to address the lawmakers concerns, or whether any of the matters Republicans have seized on might already be under investigation.Any appointment of a new special counsel, particularly in response to calls from members of Congress, is likely to lead to Democratic complaints about an undue political influence on the departments decision-making. But Boyd said in the letter that the department will never evaluate any matter except on the facts and the law.U.S. President Donald Trump, left, has continued to push an unfounded story linking his former political rival, Hillary Clinton, to a deal involving the partial sale in 2010 of the Toronto-based company Uranium One to a Russian nuclear authority. (Reuters)Sessions said at his January confirmation hearing that he would recuse himself from any investigations involving Democrat Hillary Clinton given his role as a vocal campaign surrogate to President Donald Trump. He similarly recused himself from a separate investigation into potential co-ordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, and in May, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead that probe.House Republicans in recent weeks have launched their own probes into the Obama administration and Clintons emails.Some have specifically said they want to know more about whether Obamas Department of Justice was investigating the purchase of Canadian mining company Uranium One by Rosatom, Russias state-owned nuclear company, in 2010. The agreement was reached while Clinton led the State Department and some investors in the company had relationships with former president Bill Clinton and had donated large sums to the Clinton Foundation.The letter comes one day before Sessions is to appear before the Judiciary panel for a Justice Department oversight hearing.

With a major barrier to our family planning program removed, we can now assure that every Filipino of reproductive age are provided with the whole range of quality family planning products and services that are effective, medically safe and non-abortifacient. de Leon said.Just as pleased about the FDA decision is Dr. Juan Perez III, executive director of the Commission on Population (POPCOM). In a statement sent me, he said, The Commission on Population appreciates the diligence of the Food and Drugs Administration in completing and approving the recertification of 51 contraceptives. This could not have come at a better time as depleted contraceptive supplies will now be augmented by over 200,000 implants. Annually one million women become new acceptors of modern family planning methods.The group lauded the efforts of the national government, particularly that of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and Secretary Ernesto Pernia of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), for openly declaring support for the RPRH law and their continued call for its immediate implementation.The FDA action now means that the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health (RPRH) implementation team headed by former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral has its work cut out in the coming year: fill in the gaps in the short term, while DOH now moves forward with the procurement of recertified contraceptives.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1* * *Of course theres a lot of excitement over the holding of the 31st ASEAN Summit and Related Summits right here in our country, coinciding with the Philippines key role as 2017 chair of ASEAN.The theme is simply apt  Partnering for Change, Engaging the World  drawing everyones attention to the imperative of forging solidarity among ASEAN member-states in charting and shaping a future that would redound to the benefit and blessing of the regions peoples.Among the five thematic priorities of this Summit, what stands out is the strategic direction of having a People-Oriented and People-Centered ASEAN. This gives top priority to the empowerment and social protection of women, the elderly and the disabled.From where I stand, this promises important strides in a region where the role of women in politico-socio-economic spheres must be given more importance. This is especially true in some ASEAN member-countries where women have yet to enjoy equal status with women.Empowering women should go beyond rhetoric or lip service. It must be contained in the ASEAN countries policies and pieces of legislation, so that the newfound importance of women  who typically comprise half of the population in any country  will not be left to the whim and caprice of the ruling government.One topic where womens right and chance for empowerment must be tackled is in the area of land governance  meaning, women should have as much right as men in owning lands, registering their pieces of real estate property in their name, and disposing of such property freely without the restrictive consent of men.According to Philip Hirsch, professor of Human Geography at the University of Sydney, there is very little in ASEAN documentation or institutional structures that deals with land. He was quick to add, however, that there are a couple of exceptions. There is a study commissioned by the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion of the Rights of Women and Children (ACWC) on rights of women to secure tenure of land in member countries. Second, there are environmental provisions within the ASEAN Charter under the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community that touch indirectly on land issues, for example the haze agreement and its requirements for prevention of trans-boundary impacts from land clearing.It would be good if the ASEAN summit here would place land governance in its agenda as guide to member countries. Thats because the delegates would be going back to their homelands with some policy directions, civil society initiatives, partnering arrangements across borders, and knowledge sharing, Professor Hirsch said.Speaking of knowledge sharing on land governance, the countrys premier land governance office  the Land Registration Authority (LRA) has recently accelerated its efforts for a nationwide launch of the Title Upgrade Program (TUP). LRA will be holding a series of roadshows with its key stakeholders  namely banks, real estate developers and government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs).There are 24.5 million land titles all over the country, a fraction of which are currently being converted as digitized titles. The roadshows are meant to accelerate conversion from physical paper land titles to their digitized equivalents  which will achieve security and safety of land titles.A significant percentage of land owners who opted for the digitized titles now feel secure with documents that certify their ownership of their lands. This is true for individuals, as this is also true for corporate land owners.The road shows are set on Nov. 22 and 29 at the Sulo Riviera Hotel, Quezon City.On Nov. 27, the roadshows will be held at the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) office. The Nov. 22 and 27 roadshows will target banks and financial institutions while the Nov. 29 roadshow will orient LRAs partner GOCCs and real-estate developers on the advantages of switching to e-titles.LRA Deputy Administrator Robert Nomar Leyretana told me that the Title Upgrade Program was launched  to safeguard the security and integrity of the certificate. It is after all the best proof of ownership over a piece of land, he pointed out.The Title Upgrade is actually part of LRAs Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP). Storing our land titles in cyberspace will truly secure all paper documents, have them converted into digital copies and establish an electronic database parallel to the physical copy.The good news is LRAs title upgrade program is currently being implemented in 24 Registry of Deeds offices (RDs), namely: Dagupan City, Legaspi City, Laguna, San Carlos, Batangas, Romblon, Mindoro Occidental, Catanduanes, Quezon City, Marikina City, Iloilo, Iloilo City, Cebu, Cebu City, Cotabato City, Biliran, Gingoog City, Misamis Occidental, Maguindanao, Camiguin, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Sur, and Agusan del Sur.The process is simple. Landowners and title holders should present an annotation transaction with the Register of Deeds. Then, the manually issued titles will be automatically upgraded into an eTitle.Once digitized, the vault copy of the title will be free from the risk of theft, loss or damage. Unlike paper titles, eTitles are secured from natural and man-made disasters.LRA is now working with banks, real estate developers and GOCCs, after signing a signed a memorandum of agreement to set in motion the efficient and reliable land registration procedures.We hope to forge partnerships with our stakeholders so that the public will be able to find easier access in converting their manually issued titles to eTitles, LRA Deputy Administrator Ronald Ortile pointed out.Ortile said the eTitle will contain exactly the same information as that of the manually issued title including both the names of the Registrar who issued the manually issued title and the eTitle itself.A hard copy of the new owners duplicate and/or co-owners duplicate copies of the eTitle shall then be issued when conversion is completed.Leyretana added: The title upgrade program is for the general public as well, since this will accelerate the process for GOCCs and real-estate developers.On this growing advocacy to make land governance in this country  and in other countries  favorable to our women, let our policy makers and legislators work on the details of such a policy move.* * *Email: dominitorrevillas@gmail.com",Digitizing land titles – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"US President Donald Trump invested 12 days in a blur of summitry and state visits. The trip took him to Japan, South Korea and Beijing for state visits. This was followed by trips to Vietnam for the APEC Meeting of Leaders and finally to Manila for the ASEAN Summit.It must have been a very long 12 days for Trump. He had nothing important to tell his hosts in the region. He had no clear message for the countries of what is now the most dynamic region of the world.Trump clearly struggled to matter. He substituted flattery for substance. That caused a complete reversal of his position on China, a country he once denounced as a currency manipulator.All the leaders Trump met during this tour either had refreshed mandates or enjoyed strong political support. By contrast, Trump struggles with record low approval ratings. When he returns to Washington DC, he will have to deal with a growing political controversy involving his innermost circle.No one has said Trump shone brightly during this trip. In Vietnam, he kept using the phrase Indo-Pacific. No one uses that phrase and this only underscored the extent to which the American leader kept himself unschooled in diplomacy.By contrast, Japanese Prime Minister Abe just won a snap election he called in impressive fashion. Chinese president Xi Jinping, only days before meeting Trump, was elevated to paramount status by the National Congress of the Communist Party of China. That brings him to the same status as Mao Zedong.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Xi is recognized in China as the architect of a new epoch in the countrys development. It was important for Xi to project onto the global stage the new status China achieved. The Trump visit was an important moment to begin doing that.Everything was carefully choreographed during this state visit to project the optics Beijing wanted. China was no longer the secondary power it once was. It is now at parity with the US. Beijing wants the rest of the world to see that as vividly as possible.Beijing won more than it wanted. With Trump bungling at every opportunity, with no clear strategy for the region, China emerged as the steadier power in a region in search of leadership.Chinas Belt and Road initiative, supporting the massive infrastructure build-up of neighboring countries to support more intensive trade, provides a clear framework for regional cooperation. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the main institution providing funding for new infra projects in East and Southeast Asia, is a Chinese initiative. By contrast, the US has no clear strategy for shaping the regions future.China has taken the lead as the regions advocate for more comprehensive free trade. Trump, on the contrary, has argued against free trade, driven by some archaic economic nationalism no nation takes seriously anymore.The countries of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand are reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership initiative originally broached by the US under Obama but rejected by Trump. The initiative will continue without the US.While Trumps Asian tour was in progress, Syria formally acceded to the Paris Climate Accord. That leaves the US, under Trump, the only country not participating in this global effort. Because of his peculiar views, Trump becomes the only national leader not invited to participate in the forthcoming summit on climate change.Due entirely to Trump, the US has abdicated its traditional leadership in all transnational efforts from climate change to free trade. The US has become an outlier in global affairs. That, sadly, has not dawned on Trump.Li KeqiangAt the ASEANs 50th anniversary summit, Premier Li Keqiang is in town to represent his country. This is his first foreign mission since the conclusion of the 19th CPC National Congress. It underscores the Philippines rising importance in Beijings order of things.As Chinas head of government, Li will grace the groundbreaking ceremonies for the two bridges across the Pasig that Beijing supported with grants. He will sit down with President Duterte and the leaders of Congress to discuss common concerns. The two countries are expected to issue a joint statement reflecting their points of consensus.Things have not been this warm between Manila and Beijing. The last visit by a Chinese premier happened a decade ago. During the Noynoy Aquino years, Philippines-China relations reached their lowest point.With Duterte as president, our bilateral relationship with China took on a new glow. The investment and trade agreements signed over the past year, including one where China commits to import $1.5B in tropical fruit imports, have been vital to our economic emergence.In the course of his visit, Premier Li is expected to sign more economic cooperation documents. Many of these relate to the Build, Build, Build program of government that is aligned with Chinas Belt and Road initiative. Quite a few are livelihood projects with direct and immediate impact on the lives of the poor.This year, China has become our largest trading partner. In the first seven months of this year, our bilateral trade reached $27.86 billion. This reflects a 7.6 percent increase over the same period last year.Our fruit exports to China jumped by 50 percent while the number of Chinese tourists to the Philippines surged to 250 percent. Today, an average of 1,400 Chinese tourists enter the country each day. This is attributable to Chinas lifting of travel restrictions to the Philippines.In 2016, direct investments from China rose by 47 percent over the year before. This is likely to jump even more dramatically this year.",Outlier – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Many motorists expecting solid state traffic wear adult diapers or bring plastic bottles or urinals in case they have to answer natures emergency call. Actress caper bares gaps in traffic planTHE MMDA, which oversees the traffic management in the national capital region, saw Lopezs brazenness as a serious breach of security. Its spokesperson Celine Pialago said that an apology was not enough to get the actress off the hook.Officials chorused that bragging (about) an illegal act on social media is a no-no for a person of her stature. They may have been referring to her having been Binibining Pilipinas Universe 1982, representing the country in the Miss Universe pageant in Lima, Peru, that year.Police Regional Director Oscar Albayalde of the National Capital Region and task group commander for ASEAN route security, agreed that Lopezs license should be suspended or revoked. He said:May this incident serve as a stern warning and reminder to the public that all agencies are communicating and are all working hard to provide security and order for the ASEAN Summit. Any violations of the protocols and rules set forth by the ASEAN Task Forces shall not be tolerated.Catalino Cuy, officer-in-charge of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, said Lopezs violation should not be condoned nor tolerated as it can halt and derail traffic management and can put at risk both the summit delegates and the traffic violators themselves.No official has explained, however, why their best laid out traffic plan was breached by an ordinary motorist acting on impulse. It took her mentioning it on Facebook for them to note the violation. Reports were skimpy on other motorists who followed Lopez into the breached ASEAN lane.Without intending it, Lopezs call of nature may have shown up the inadequacies of the governments approach to long-festering problems whose parameters have been more or less already established. Are we ready to learn from the unfortunate incident? Traffic bosses can borrow from JapanDURING the one-year advance notice, what was done to plan for the expected transporting of x-number of people, including dignitaries, in connection with the ASEAN events that the Philippines had been pre-determined to host in 2017?How we eventually fared can be seen in scattered reports, some of them in media  including anecdotes of motorists peeing in their pants, of vehicles overheating or running out of fuel while stuck in stalled traffic, of ambulances with relatives of dying patients crying for deliverance, etc.One unanswered question is why thousands of vehicles, with engines running, have to wait three to five hours beside ASEAN lanes that are empty. Did not the elaborate plans include possibly using the idle lanes for regular traffic during the long wait for the VIP convoys?Obviously, the time-and-motion study for ASEAN traffic management was inadequate. Could not planners have calculated the escorted VIP convoys length/volume, their speed on what routes, their travel time between pre-marked points  so their entering the special lanes could be anticipated to the nearest 10 minutes?While the convoys are still hours away, the empty ASEAN lanes could have been opened to other traffic, and reverted to VIP use at calculated intervals.With modern communication equipment and computers  coupled with competent captains and efficient personnel on the ground  this degree of precision could have been approximated. Confusion, irritation and damage could have been minimized.If ASEAN traffic planners and managers did not know how to do it, one easy way out would have been for the administration to ask the Japanese how it is done.We presume that Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a good friend of President Rodrigo Duterte, would have been glad to send his boys to help.* * *ADVISORY: All Postscripts from 1997 to the present can be accessed at manilamail.com.

The statement, in case it is issued, is unlikely to change the status quo in the disputed waters or stop any military buildup that is certain to affect freedom of navigation and overflight in the area.For many years now, ASEAN has been trying to hammer out a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea with Beijing, which claims nearly all of the sea. The initiative is moving at glacial pace. Divided, ASEAN has failed to stop China from creating artificial islands with military facilities in disputed waters. The Philippines, winner of an international arbitration case that invalidated Chinas entire claim over the South China Sea, might yet turn out to be the loser for lack of interest in asserting its sovereign rights. Little progress is expected in this area at the ongoing ASEAN summit.The 10-member grouping has better chances of moving together in the same direction in other areas. These include addressing climate change and cooperating to stop the spread of terrorism, the drug menace, human trafficking, piracy and other transnational crimes.Southeast Asia is home to the opium-producing region known as the Golden Triangle, one of the two largest in the world. Weak law enforcement and corruption have also allowed producers and traffickers of other narcotics as well as synthetic drugs such as shabu to thrive. Closer ASEAN cooperation is needed to win this war.Terrorism influenced by the Islamic State is another threat that could engulf the region. The IS-inspired Mautes and Abu Sayyaf terrorists were neutralized and flushed out of Marawi, but only after five months and the loss of over a thousand lives. IS fighters, killed or booted out of their former strongholds in Iraq and Syria, reportedly continue to aspire to set up a new base in Southeast Asia. Concerted ASEAN action can best thwart such plans.ASEAN can look back to the past 50 years as a generally peaceful period that allowed its members to develop and prosper and become one of the worlds most dynamic regions.

But what earned him praise was his consistency in the matters of global economy. In his keynote speech at the APEC CEO Summit, he once again stressed that globalization should pave the way to equal distribution of wealth, and that it should create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to grow.Currently consisting of 21-member states representing the Asia-Pacific region, in a nutshell the organization aims to improve each others economy and shared prosperity. But how exactly does the APEC affect our lives as Filipinos? While this annual forum discusses economic matters that concern the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, the decisions and agreements made during this gathering lead to the development of economic policies that matter to each member state, such as improvements in free trade, strengthening the advocacies of micro, small, and medium businesses and helping these reach the international market, all of which were voiced out by President Duterte.In his keynote speech at the APEC CEO Summit, President Duterte emphasized on the salience of working together, not just of the member states but also with the cooperation of local and international business communities, to achieve a prosperous future for all. As leaders in our respective fields, we must ensure that globalization does not lead to wealth generation, but equitably, wealth distribution as well, he said.Aside from physical connectivity, President Duterte also encouraged the business community to continue to promote people to people connectivity as a critical growth and development strategy. He likewise proposed that businesses adopt an Inclusive Business Model that provides opportunities for those at the bottom of the pyramid.To end his speech, President Duterte talked about the essence of true cooperation and what the less developed countries and small businesses need. He said that in true cooperation all are partners and everyone contributes. He stressed that the small businesses and less developed countries are not asking for charity but greater market access and the opportunity to participate in growth and development.As he usually does in his visits abroad, even when he has a busy schedule, President Duterte allotted a time to meet the Filipino community in Da Nang, Vietnam. Here he explained why he attended the APEC Summit and what it is all about. He also talked to them about globalization, both its advantages and disadvantages. In this regard, we see a leader who also finds it important for his countrymen to understand what is happening and what hes doing for the sake of the country.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1President Duterte also discussed the dangers of shabu and quoted a publication from the United Nations: Methamphetamine.

Do not destroy my country because Im building a nation. Do not destroy the youth of the land that sila lang ang ating greatest assets, he said.In his talk with the Filipino Community, we saw the bravery of the president even against terrorists. While the terrorists are willing to sacrifice their lives, our president also stated that he is willing-and is doing the same to protect Philippines. Do not threaten me with something which will come to me anyway. Wag mo akong takutin. Sabi ko, Lika, punta tayo Marawi. We are here ready to die for our country.

Regardless of how hard hes working to give the Filipinos a better future, it seems that President Duterte just wants us to see him as an ordinary government employee whos doing his job for the country.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)SALT LAKE CITY  Rudy Gobert believes he has every right to be upset after sustaining a leg injury thats expected to keep him out at least four weeks.The Utah Jazz big man went down Friday when Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters crashed into his leg, causing Goberts knee to buckle. The 7-foot-1 center initially called it a dirty play.Waiters was going after a loose ball, then dove awkwardly into Goberts leg. He later tweeted, Dove for the ball right with video of the play.ADVERTISEMENTWaiters told the Sun-Sentinel on Sunday that hes never been a dirty player and, Tell him to get out of his feelings and thats what it is, just like that.Its not my feelings, its my knee, Gobert said Monday. Thats a little more important.I like to play basketball. Sometimes if someone takes that away from you, youve got to get in your feelings for a reason.Gobert woke up Saturday with unexpected stiffness and swelling in the leg. An MRI revealed a bruised right tibia. The 2016-17 second-team All-NBA center said it could have been worse and hes happy to know hell fully recover with no ligament or structural damage. The rehab process is basically to get the swelling down and stay strong and in shape.Playoff aspirations and individual goals remain intact, though they will be much more difficult for Utah to achieve. The Jazz have now lost Gobert for a month, Joe Johnson (wrist) has yet to return and was expected to miss a month, and Dante Exum is out for the season after shoulder surgery. All this after the team lost its top two scorers, Gordon Hayward and George Hill, during offseason free agency.Just frustrating that Ill miss some time, Gobert said. At the same time Im feeling lucky because when I look at the video, if I dont lift my foot up in the air at the same moment, itd be way worse. Good and bad.The Frenchman is averaging 13.9 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game. Derrick Favors started atcenter Saturday and had 24 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks.The Jazz plan to re-evaluate Gobert after four weeks and the general timeline for his return is four to six weeks. Utahs top player is optimistic it will be sooner than that.ADVERTISEMENTUsually, I heal very fast, Gobert said. Were not going to rush it or do anything stupid. But Im pretty confident that I can be back before that.","Gobert to Waiters: ‘It’s not my feelings, it’s my knee’ – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

The first chance came in the 21st minute when Iain Ramsay found De Murga inside the box only for the defender to send his shot over the bar.The spell of good play from the Azkals was highlighted by a couple of big opportunities in the 35th minute. Curt Dizon cut inside from the right and stung the palm of the Nepalese keeper Kiran Limbu, who could only save the ball into the path of Mike Ott. The diminutive atttacker, however, couldnt get solid contact with the Kiran to beat.Just after the hour mark, Kiran was called into action by Simone Rota, who rifled a long range effort. The rebound fell to skipper Phil Younghusband, who sprayed his effort wide.The game opened up late in the second half as the Azkals threw men forward and Junior Munoz and De Murga had to make a couple of timely blocks to deny the hosts from going ahead.Azkals coach Thomas Dooley sent Pika Minegishi and James Younghusband into the fray in the hopes of boosting the attack. Off an Iain Ramsays inswinging corner, the ball found its way Sato, whose free header was cleared off the line in the 83rd minute.Well drilled and disciplined defensively for most of the contest, the Nepalese rode their luck in stoppage time. Neil Etheridges free kick picked out De Murga whose header rattled the crossbar as the Azkals came within inches of qualifying with a game to spare.",Azkals held to a draw anew as Asian Cup berth remained elusive – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

The festival was just a sampling of around 5,350 traditional recipes in Indonesian cuisine.Indonesian cuisine includes rice, noodle and soup dishes and varies greatly by region and influence. Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as gulai and curry, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence.Most Indonesians prefer savory, hot and spicy food so our dishes tend to have rich and complex flavors derived from certain ingredients and spices. These ingredients and spices are mostly grown, if not exclusive to the Indonesian archipelago, says Trini Gunarti, Minister Counselor for the Office of Social and Cultural Affairs of the Indonesian Embassy Manila.Spicy and savory condiments like sambal (chili sauce with shrimp paste) and kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) are a staple in every Indonesian dining table. Some Indonesian dishes such as rendang, nasi goreng, gado-gado, satay and soto are also considered national dishes because of their popularity.Several Indonesia brands such as Alfamart, Kopiko and Sosro also showcased their products in the annual food fair. These brands are a testament to ever-growing acceptance of Indonesian brands in the Philippine market.

A small, nondescript scroll-like sign that reads Kyo-to is etched on the entrance of the restaurant, which is actually on the ground floor of the Prudential Guarantee building.By the well-lit kappo, a dining bar for eight, Ryohei Kawamoto, the Japanese chef of the restaurant, brings out a century-old Meiji bento box wrapped in special Japanese paper. The bento box reveals a big shiny slice of raw ootoro (tuna belly) from the Tsukiji market in Tokyo. With Zen-like demeanor, chef Ryohei gently cuts into the ootoro. Each bite-size slice is placed on the side, like a work of art.From another bento box he takes out two big, fat Hokkaido hotate (scallops), cuts them into bite sizes, and, again, each slice is lined on the side like a work of art.Indeed, dining at Kyo-to is basking in the centuries-old Japanese tradition as the ootoro-hotate sashimi is served in a 250-year-old Edo bowl. When Ryohei came to Manila in 2011 to work at the Japanese ambassadors house, he brought with him his collection of a thousand Edo plates, bowls, teapots and teacups. Some of his Edo pieces, a prized find, he uses to serve the guests at the 187-sqm. Kyo-to restaurant that can seat 40 people in its three dining rooms, two VIP rooms and the kappo.The ootoro melts in the mouth, its velvety texture makes love to the palate, leaving a memorable, tasty sensation. The hotate from the waters of Hokkaido, on the other hand, is sweet with a gentle tang. It gives off a milky, creamy taste once it hits the gustatory buds. Heaven.The dobin mushi soup with buri (yellow-fin tuna), unagi (eel) and Shimeji mushroom that the diner pours into a ceramic bowl from a small, gorgeous teapot is an excursion to a delectable dreamland. It is piping-hot  a word of caution there  but you dont mind scalding your lips with this soup that heats your stomach and warms your soul.

Yes, the customer is at the mercy of chef Ryohei at the restaurant that is only open during dinnertime, from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. The set menu (of five, six or eight courses) varies according to the season.My five-course set menu actually started with a beautiful appetizer served on an Edo plate. If a haiku could take physical form, it would look like the appetizer at Kyo-to, where lightly fried rice crisps, chestnuts rubbed with rock salt and sweet gingko were put together on a shida fern to look like beautiful poetry. I never thought a poetic line or verse could actually taste delicious!Kyo-to restaurant manager Yasuo Takatsugu (who is also the VP for corporate planning and communications of Prudential Guarantee) swears that only the best and freshest ingredients enter the kitchen of the restaurant because we source our ingredients in local markets in the Philippines and also in the markets in Japan.Ryohei had an early love affair with the kitchen because his caring mother showed him the way to it. An excellent cook herself, Ryoheis mother imparted to her son the joy of cooking.That I should cook with love. And love will make good food taste even better, says chef Ryohei, who was hired as the personal chef of Prudential Guarantee owner Robert Coyiuto before he took on the kitchen of Kyo-to restaurant.He worked at the renowned kitchen of Kitcho in Tokyo for eight years, beginning as a dishwasher, cleaner until he became an assistant cook. He was promoted and allowed to cook, eventually earning the privilege of preparing seafood for mukozuke, a course of sliced seasonal sashimi, which, according to Takatsugu, is considered as the highest honor in the Kitcho kitchen. The Kitcho kitchen, he says, is the origin of the centuries-old kaiseki cuisine, which has its history engraved in the tea ceremony of the monks.Kai means pocket and seki means stone. Literally it means pocket stone, which, in the olden times, is a ritual done in tea ceremonies where people put a heated stone in their pocket to warm them during the cold weather, Takatsugu explains.And before the dinner ends, chef Ryohei serves with a smile a bowl of mochi ice cream with soybean and tea powder.

But theres one request that he wanted me (to) relay (sic) with you, hes requesting if we could forget about him as an actor, as a karting driver or even as a triathlete, the showbiz correspondent appealed. He wanted us to see him today as a singer.Its true that Matteo has worn so many hats since he started his career in showbiz as a part of a teenage comedy sitcom 10 years ago. Most recently, he dipped his feet into other waters trying out the action genre by starring in a film on human trafficking and the harmony between Muslims and Christians. Indeed, Matteo is a person who reinvents himself and doesnt settle for just one specific facet of his career.

The show was a huge success as fans and supporters packed the 4,000-seater Waterfront Hotel Ballroom. And because of this success, the team behind the show thought of bringing the concert to Manila, which this time, has a different concept.The team wanted to stage it at a bigger venue but we thought of just holding it at the Kia Theater because I think were not yet ready for the Big Dome. Although I really trust my team, it is still scary to think how to fill up a big venue. But I heard the VIP tickets are nearly sold out and the tickets in the other sections are moving so sana we can have a full house, he said.Matteo promised that his Manila concert is going to be more of a rock and roll fun show.We are prioritizing original music, more than the covers, he said adding he will be singing the songs from his newly released album, which introduces the other side of him  as a singer.The whole album was inspired by the whole truth. Its about what I feel. I hope the millennials will also relate to it, if theyre going through the same thing, he said.The album, after his self-titled CD released last year, has 10 songs.

The research, which was conducted by way of an online questionnaire, spanned 30 countries, 4,900 kids aged six to 11, and 4,100 of their parents.This was what Viacom found out: Virtually all kids have a role in the decision-making in households in the Philippines (97 percent) and the world (98 percent), and that parents take into consideration what their childrens opinions are.Christian Kurz, SVP of Global Consumer Insights for Viacom, talks about the findings of Kid Power Christian Kurz, SVP of Global Consumer Insights for Viacom, talks about the findings of Kid PowerChristian Kurz, senior vice president of Global Consumer Insights at Viacom, said in a statement: There is a different undercurrent in families today and the changing relationship means that parents and kids are now working as teams. Subsequently, this translates to how kids exert surprising influence when it comes to brand choices and decision-making in a home, and our research shows the depth of this influence.Categories that kids show the most influence are entertainment, groceries, restaurants and electronics.Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1The largest percentages of kids say they affect decisions are around entertainment (97 percent both global and the Philippines), food and groceries (94 percent global, 97 percent Philippines), restaurants (84 percent global, 89 percent Philippines), electronics (82 percent global and 85 percent Philippines), vacation (76 percent global, 72 percent Philippines), and telecom/pay TV/SVOD (52 percent global, 58 Philippines).The survey noted that the areas in the country where kids input holds most sway, are toys (96 percent), movies at home (93 percent), snacks (92 precent), clothes (87 percent), watching television shows together (85 percent), and going to fast food restaurants together (84 percent).What we are really saying (is) the combination of all those things means that families are more and more turning towards democracies rather than dictatorships if you will. And yes, of course, the parents still have the ultimate say, but its 97 percent of all parents (surveyed) in the Philippines saying that their kid has impact on household decisions. Thats a humongous number but that, of course, varies in how big the influence is and what they have an influence on, Kurz told The STAR in a separate interview.Other results from the Kid Power survey:Running the household practically involves everyone. Almost seven out of 10 parents globally state that their kids help at home. The Philippines, however, registered a higher number with 80 percent of kids helping out at home. According to Pinoy parents, most common tasks kids do are cooking, shopping or cleaning (53 percent) and childcare (44 percent).The research also studied the amount of help flowing in and out of the household. It said that kids receive assistance with childcare from grandparents. At the same time, 56 percent of Pinoy kids also lend a helping hand to extended family or relatives outside their homes, which meant a 26-percent increase from the global average. Viacom said that it could be attributed to the multi-generational structure prevalent in Filipino households. Kurz revealed that other than India, the Philippines has the biggest number of families living in the same house as grandparents (41 percent versus 13 percent global).Dinna Zaratan is Viacom country manager for the Philippines Dinna Zaratan is Viacom country manager for the PhilippinesThe Kid Power survey also touched on Internet use, indicating that kids around the world are increasingly describing themselves as curious (89 percent global, 92 percent Philippines). Access to Internet-enabled technology is what encourages this curiosity. Plus, they have more devices at their disposal for playing games, communication and finding out information. The percentages of kids aged nine to 11 (global versus Philippines) who own or habitually use these devices are as follows: Smartphone 72 percent/88 percent; tablet  72 percent/84 percent; and Smart TV  50 percent/42 percent.Boys and girls also hold similar level of persuasive powers in the Philippines. Kurz said that kids with more influence are those who have siblings, have working parents and are living in urban areas. The Viacom executive believes that these numbers will continue to grow as more families live and work in urban areas.Nevertheless, Kid Power found out that even with these shifting family dynamics, the parent is still the boss in the Philippines and elsewhere in the world. Kids acknowledge that the parent has the ultimate say (72 percent global, 63 percent Philippines); and parents claim that their partner is the boss of the household (76 percent global, 62 percent Philippines).Saying that research is the foundation of everything that they do at Nickelodeon, so that they know how children consume media, learn what is happening in their real world and reflect them in content that speaks to them, Kurz said that Kid Power goes to show that kids are very, very much involved in conversations in how to help each other. Kids are becoming curious in how the world works, and were seeing parents very much asking their kids for their opinions as well.He added, There are two takes to that: One reason is, if I want my kids to be a responsible adult at some point, then I dont want them to protect them from all these decisions. I want them to be involved so we can have this conversation like I dont want you to have this toy today because you just bought this, etc. And those types of conversations are happening younger and younger. Kids are very much aware of that as well. Kids are wanting to be involved because it validates them.Another takeaway for him is that family entertainment continues to be very important. One of the things we saw in this and in other pieces of research, sitting down and watching something together as a family is a key bonding moment in the household. So that means, content choices are very, very important for parents as well as for the kids.Kurz also stressed that the survey was done online. Sometimes, we asked the parents and the children the same questions, and more often than not, their answers were very much aligned, which is also interesting because they know what each other think. But it was an online survey. So for the Philippines, it was representative only of people who are online which is not the whole country, and were very aware of that. But were particularly interested in the future and the emergent trends.Early this year, a report on Internet trends called Digital in 2017 released by Hootsuite and We Are Social said that as of January 2017, 58 percent of the over 100 million Filipinos have access to the Internet.",Study says kids exert ‘powerful influence’ in family entertainment – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"Capitalism makes poor people rich, but only when its working at its best.In last weeks release of the Paradise Papers, CBC Investigates helped remind us of an alternative objective of capitalism echoed in Washingtons quest for tax breaks for the wealthiest.That is the pressure to make sure rich people are able to hang on to their advantageous positions.The historic argument over exactly how much tax each person should contribute is as much political as it is economic.Taxation is theft (or is it property?)The polarized politics might be characterized by contrasting the assertion by 18th-century anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon that property is theft with the modern anarcho-capitalist insistence that taxation is theft.Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, had a pragmatic take on taxes. He argued they were essential to a well-run state and so everyone should be required to contribute.It was Scottish economist Adam Smith, often called the father of modern capitalism, who declared people should be taxed according to their ability to pay. (David Moir/Reuters)Among his four basic requirements for a good tax system  which included the stipulation they should not be arbitrary and that they should be convenient to collect and to pay  was that they should be proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay.It was Smith, not Karl Marx, who gave us the principle that rich people should pay more tax.Someone has to payAs previously pointed out during the 2016 release of the Panama Papers, someone has to pay for the roads and ports, corporate subsidies and bailouts that keep the Canadian economy ticking.Every penny that the well-off fail to pay falls onto the shoulders of poorer wage earners who have no way of escaping the clutches of the Canada Revenue Agency.In a world where the rich have disproportionate clout in the corridors of power, it is no surprise that the richest 1 per cent are expected to benefit the most from the U.S. tax changes proposed last week.Loafers and passive investors the winners in U.S. tax plan. https://t.co/4nPf1z3ICG  @don_pittisThat may not be good for the global economy.There are good reasons to think that the world is returning to an era where what John Maynard Keynes called the functionless investor is once again superseding the active capitalist that makes economies dynamic.If you believe in the power of capitalism to make the world a better place, it is hard to fault people like Steve Jobs and his financial backers who took risks to create an entire new industry.From Russia with nothingIn Canada there are many examples, including the Bronfman family that came to Canada from Russia with nothing and made themselves and Canada rich. Frank Stronach, founder of car parts giant Magna International, could tell a similar story.But since those days, Canada and the world have experienced what Bank of Canada deputy governor Sylvain Leduc recently called declining dynamism.It is certainly hard to see the social contribution of passive investors who hold onto the wealth and power created by their dynamic forebears by using that power to convince governments to let them pay less in taxes.As we are told repeatedly by advocates for people and businesses that keep billions of dollars in low-tax offshore funds, they really arent breaking the rules.Not illegalOffshore trusts are not illegal, said Ian Lee, former banker and now professor at Carleton Universitys Sprott School of Business.Of course that raises the question of why the Government of Canada  as the representative of Canadian voters with a median income of about $30,000  would create a set of laws that allows rich passive investors to avoid billions in taxes.There is a consensus in mainstream economics that whether Proudhon was right or wrong, property ownership makes economies stronger. As even self-declared Communist countries such as China and Vietnam discovered, switching from collective farms to private small-holders caused a boom in agricultural production.However, the breaking up of huge estates controlled by a passive landowning class has shown similar economic benefits.When it comes to money, there is increasing evidence that the funding of capital projects from what Keynes called the savings of the rich out of their superfluity, is no longer as important as it once was. Certainly there is no shortage of cash to drive up the price of the worlds safest assets.Places like the South America and the Persian Gulf, where the rich control almost all the resources, are not models of democratic or economic health. The strongest economies are not built on selling or getting tax breaks on a few yachts and private jets. They are those with active dynamic populations where everyone can participate.If governments want to build strong capitalist economies, rather than using their laws to help keep the wealthy rich, the evidence is that legislators must let the already rich look after themselves, and turn their attention instead to making laws that help hard-working aspiring capitalists become rich for the first time.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittisMore analysis from Don Pittis",Why getting rich is better for the world than staying rich: Don Pittis – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

This lovely square was designated a National Historic Site in 1984.This patch of more-than-just-green is annually open from May to November from eight in the morning until the romantic and poetic time of one half hour before dusk.This fine example of a Victorian garden is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence and a magnificent set of ornamental gates, which bear the words E Mari Merces, which translates to wealth from the sea, the coat of arms of the harbor city in the maritime province of Nova Scotia of Atlantic Canada.We headed straight to the Bandstand, the literal and figurative center, which has been a venue for concerts and social events for well over a century, dedicated to Queen Victorias Golden Jubilee in 1887. There are free Sunday band concerts held from mid-June to mid-September from 2 to 4 p.m.Surrounding this structure are numerous Geometric Beds  I lost count at 32  a common element of Victorian-type gardens, which bloom in more colors than the rainbow.Lifestyle Feature  Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Not to be confused with the Geometric Beds are the Carpet Beds, another Victorian tradition, which consists of densely arranged dwarf plants of varying contrasting hues, all forming a specific design. These shrubs are not allowed to flower and are religiously trimmed to keep the desired look.Likewise not to be missed are the vegetable and fruits beds, whose products can compete in country fairs and end up as Blue Ribbon winners.There is also a display of tropical plants such as agaves, euphorbia milii and some variants of cacti  semi arid and desert plants not local to Canada. Raised in greenhouses to survive the winters, it is a treat to those who may not otherwise see these anywhere else within the country.Another eye candy which certainly got our attention was a huge sea of large dahlias of many different varieties, in never-seen-before sizes, oddly unique shapes, every imaginable color, each labelled for identification and better appreciation.Some American Chestnut trees were pointed out, which interestingly claimed to be an endangered species with only close to a hundred remaining in the province. Some successful propagation efforts are ongoing.We then crossed some pedestrian lanes  there were no drive throughs here  to end up at the Horticultural Hall, originally a meeting place and remains, as of today, the oldest part of the Halifax Public Gardens.Having signed the guestbook, as millions before us have done, we were ushered into its Uncommon Grounds Cafe, where we enjoyed a wonderful cup of coffee by its terrace, while we had an animated chat with the tour guide amongst select books, postcards and clothing, as souvenirs.Due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Juan in 2003, huge portions of the gardens had to be reconstructed. During the massive rebuilding effort, the Horticultural Hall Plaza, the newest addition to the park, was erected through the generosity of local businesses and thousands of citizens. At its center is a fountain which basin is supported by figures of five swans.Our next stop was the classical Victoria Jubilee Fountain with the cornerstone nymph named Egeria, supported by a Corinthian column protruding from a heavy basin and surrounded by four serpents.Not to be outdone is the Boer War Memorial Fountain, topped by a figure of a local rifleman supported by crane-and-daffodil decorated columns, erected to commemorate the Canadian soldiers who lost their lives in the South African War from 1899 to 1902.Beside lies a showcase of Weeping European Beech and Camperdown Elm tree, looking extra melancholic after learning it was donated by the proud family of a Canadian soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice during the turmoil of hostilities.All over are benches donated for various noble causes and heart-rending reasons as memorials and tributes. I urge you to contemplate on the stories behind every individual marker  each sharing gets more heart-wrenching than the previous one.As we roamed around, we noticed several larger than life statues, generously donated by Estate Chief Justice Sir William Young (1799-1887). Three Roman goddesses originated from his garden  Ceres for fertility and agriculture, Flora for the spring season and flowers, Diana for woodland and wild animals.Complementing this collection are carved likeness of Sir Winston Churchill, Great Britains wartime prime minister; Samuel Cunard, founder of the leading operator of pioneering passenger ships in the North Atlantic; and Scottish poet Robert Burns of Auld Lang Syne fame.We soon stumbled upon the man-made Griffins Pond, named after a young Irishman who was hanged on its banks and whose murder conviction was regrettably later questioned.The Titanic is commemorated in this area. Three Halifax-based ships sailed off to rescue the living and recover the dead of this vessel which sank on its maiden voyage.The unsinkable may be reminisced here through its model  drawing from another Victorian tradition of having ship models in your own garden pool.We then strolled through the picturesque concrete Upper Bridge, a slightly arched deck decorated with balusters and urns, an ideal site for wedding and commencement photographs. It bears a plaque which recognizes the bravery of Inspector Francis Fitzgerald, a Haligonian Boer War Veteran and the first commander of the Royal North West Mounted Police.To cap off our visit to the gardens, we had the opportunity to gaze at fowl and avian life within the Bird Enclosure, which was once the haven of swans, dating back to the time when King George V donated the first pair in 1926. Today, geese and migratory birds may be spotted taking a break in the vicinity.As I watched the birds slowly float above the water in complete silence, this tranquility amidst numerous people perfectly encapsulates the soul of the Halifax Public Gardens.",A gem of a garden – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"Just when you thought youve had one too many muffins and shakes and blazing tangerine sunsets, Boracay whips out something new to try: a cute thematic bar, a monster-sized club, a death-defying aqua sport. Its what I love about the island  how its always almost unrecognizable with every visit, and how both the strange and familiar win you over, every time. Proof that Boracay is in constant evolution is the latest hotel of its scale to open on the island, Hue Hotels & Resorts Boracay. Its a statement hotel in that the structure itself, which managing director Dexter Lee likens to the Roman Colosseum, is not at all shy about imposing its presence. Likewise, what the property brings to the table  an elevated experience of Boracay culture  is foreseen to transform the way we vacation on the island. Their actual statement: to bring that vibrancy to Hue Boracay so that the only reason theyll leave the hotel is for the beach, says Dexter. This lofty mission is accomplished in several ways, from its super-comfy beds (custom-made for Hue and checked for quality by Dexter himself), its very extra pool (stocked with lounge chairs and floaties) and pool bar, Prisma (stocked with the largest collection of rum in the country), down to its already popular open-to-all lifestyle center, Station X.Your own private islandHue Boracay does incite that feeling of never wanting to leave (not in the Hotel California sense, but in a why-struggle-outside-when-its-so-nice-here kind of way). Its built so that it literally extends an open invitation to non-hotel guests. No walls, no gates, just friendly security guards in friendly shorts to usher you in. There are two entrances, one along the Main Road, which goes to the hotel, and the other one through a side street, which leads to Station X and its restaurants. Once youre in, youd have to be a real bore to not want to explore its many features that are, as millennials would say, Instagrammable AF.The pool, the nucleus of the spacious Hue sphere, is an oval oasis that connects to Prisma, so you can have drinks on an inflatable rainbow-cloud, as one does. Order a rum cocktail for the full experience.The rooms are spacious and tropical-themed, so you wont feel too detached from #islandlife. The shower, toilet and sink are free-standing, which saves a lot of time and, also, potentially, some bladders.To make sure guests have a comfortable and memorable stay, Hue partnered with Hospitality Innovators, Inc. (HII) to manage the property. HII founder and CEO Luis Monserrat shares that what makes Hue Boracay unique is its value for space, which is gold in crowded Boracay. Theres so much open space in the hotel. For developers, thats money. The fact that they were willing to trade that off for the guests experience is pretty special, he says.As a guest of three days, I can attest to the fact that the beach (only two minutes away) is, indeed the only reason to consider enduring the task of putting ones valuables in a bag and putting on real clothes. Its true how space can be a luxury  a very addictive luxury, especially when in busy Boracay. In the event that you do decide to go out but dont want to bring a bag, Hue Boracay makes sure that you dont get locked out of your room by re-fashioning the highly impractical room key-card into a waterproof rubber bracelet (that wont deactivate at contact with a phone, yay!). Clever advertising, too. According to Dexter, the Hue bracelet will soon also act as a method of payment Station X establishments. Simply tap and go.Lifestyle Feature  Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Your very own stationStations 1, 2 and 3, formerly boat stations, have long been only universally known major points of reference on the island, which does not apply the use of street names and signs. To invent a new station is a gutsy move. Perhaps others have thought of it, but its not something you pull off with a mere neon sign. To create a station is to cultivate a new culture, and this is what Station X in Hue Boracay does.While other hotels on the island may have one or two restaurants, Station X has nine (and one more coming). These are homegrown brands that you wont see anywhere else, so that when youre craving for Supermagics Umami Burger, or Little Wave Coffee Co.s Slutty Brownie, or Fat Rices Cha Ca La Vong, youd have to fly to Boracay to get some. The nice part is, Station X doesnt look like your usual retail-area-floor  the look transitions nicely between the hotel and street life. You wont feel out of place at all in your wet, sandy swimsuit.From the first Hue Hotel, which opened in Puerto Princesa, Palawan early this year, incorporating local culture and homegrown brands has been part of its DNA, as Hue Hotels & Resorts managing director Dennis Lee points out. These tenants at Station X reflect the creativity and originality Hue Boracay values. We continue to espouse our advocacy of promoting local culture, so we made sure to prioritize these entrepreneurs whose concepts are unique and world-class, Dennis says.Station X houses the islands first and only food hall called Streetmarket, probably the sexiest food hall youll ever meet. Its where you can get fresh seafood at Percy Seafood, comfort food at Winner Winner, Asian cuisine Fat Rice, pizza at Diavolo, Mexican fare from Santa Peligrosa, yakitori from Poketo, and iced desserts from Sugar Cloud. All are run by Hue partners, entrepreneur husband-and-wife Nowie and Odette Potenciano, who say theyre keeping these establishments exclusive to Boracay.Also within Station X are Nonies, which serves guilt-free healthy meals, Local Color, a shop of cute and unique locally-made pasalubong products, and Boracays only premium KTV bar. Most of these establishments owners, managers and staff are locals whove always lived on the island and they say Hue Boracay is an exciting addition to the scene.Boracays next waveA lot of people are saying that Boracay is on its way out, but the locals themselves have been telling us that its not going to fall anytime soon, and we want to be the first to initiate that kind of change, says Dennis. Change is, in this case, Hue Boracays introduction of their cosmopolitan local concept through the hotel and Station X. Theyve always thought of building hotels like chameleons, anyway (thats why they call them Hue!), and come to a city or an island, embrace its lifestyle, involve the locals, all while giving it that Hue twist.* * *Hue Hotels & Resorts Boracay is located at Station 2, Main Road, Boracay Island, Malay, Aklan, Philippines.

Back then, Airbus people told me stories of how the whole town of Toulouse would come out and line the streets each time a truck carrying an aircraft part (and the parts were huge!) would make its way to the Airbus plant. Last week, it was a global affair as Singapore Airlines introduced the new cabin products to media from all over the world at Suntec Center.The layout of the new A380 has the First and Businesses Classes on the upper deck of the aircraft (they were in the lower deck previously); the lower deck has Premium Economy in front and Economy Class in the main cabin.Lifestyle Feature  Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Singapore Airlines is investing US$850 million in its Airbus fleet. The first of five new A380s will start flying on Dec. 18 to Sydney as its first route, while the 14 existing ones will be retrofitted starting in late 2018 and are targeted for completion in 2020.The piece de resistance of the redesign is the First Class Suites, measuring 50 square feet each. The Suites also feature double beds for couples in a room that measures 100 square feet. The carrier has been offering double beds since they began flying the A380 but the new suites are swankier than ever before.Our original Suites were the first to offer double beds in the sky and they are still regarded as the ultimate in premium travel, SIA chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong says. Not only are we retaining that feature, but now the beds are even more plush and comfortable than before.In a one-one configuration in First Class, two single suites (the first two rows on the same side of the cabin) are converted into a couples suite. When the sliding privacy partition is lowered, the two single beds become one with a leather seat on either side.Now in a subtle gray palette, the suites are very spacious. When the bed is stowed into a diving wall, a passenger can accommodate a guest to sit on a folding-style ottoman for dinner or to watch movies on the 32-inch HD TV.The new suites were designed by the Paris-based Pierrejean Design Studio, which specializes in luxury yachts and aircraft, and manufactured by Zodiac Seats UK.Design office manager Jacques Pierrejean says, The idea from the beginning was to give passengers a room, not only a seat. Its very comfortable; if I want to have dinner, I can do that from my seat with the TV in front of me, and if I want to sleep I move to the bed.The firm had a team of 10 designers working with Singapore Airlines starting four years ago. To do such work, you not only have to imagine the concept but to feel it.And there were women on the team, too, so details such as where to stow your handbag and makeup bag, a mirror and other things were thoughtfully reconfigured.The amenity kit is by Lalique, so are the soft furnishings like bed sheets and duvet, slippers and pajamas; the seats are upholstered in leather by Italian furniture company Poltrona Frau; and the bone china dinnerware is by English company Wedgewood.Goh Choon Phong adds that the new cabin offerings are a product of years of research and focus groups that SIA conducted with its passengers.What do they want when flying? Their answers were unequivocal: A bespoke, luxurious personal space (the theme of the launch was Space made personal, experience the difference). Goh said they dont have any plans on installing showers or a bar in their future A380s because that wasnt a priority for their passengers.Designer Jacques Pierrejean says, Singapore Airlines for us is at the top of the market now and I think it will be the benchmark for the next decade.The new Business Class cabin was designed by JPA Design of the UK and manufactured for Singapore Airlines by JAMCO Corporation of Japan. Like First Class, it features classy leather seats by Poltrona Frau in addition to lightweight carbon composite materials.Unlike the older A380 Business Class seat, which a flight attendant has to make into a flat bed for the passenger, this new seat has buttons for the passenger to take full control of his seat.They may also stretch out fully in a sun-deck position to watch movies on the 18-inch high definition touch-screen monitor.A larger back shell on every seat creates a cocoon-like feel for more privacy while the center divider can be fully lowered to form double beds, making the two center seats an ideal choice for couples or families.Seats in the Business Class cabin are arranged in a forward-facing, one-two-one configuration that offers all customers direct access to the aisle.The middle seats can be converted into double beds.Other features include a business panel equipped with USB ports and in-seat power, reading lights with adjustable brightness level, mood lighting, enlarged dining table designed for flexibility in dining positions, as well as stowage space for personal amenities with a thoughtful design that puts everything within easy reach.Premium Economy Class  designed by JPA Design and manufactured by ZIM Flugsitz GmbH  has also changed its color scheme. Its leather seats are now in gray and theres more space in the magazine compartment in front of you to slip in your laptop. It has a calf-rest and foot-bar for every seat, individual in-seat power supply, two USB ports, personal in-seat reading light and cocktail table.Each seat is 19.5-inch wide with an eight-inch recline and seat pitch of 38 inches. Customers have an enhanced in-flight entertainment experience with active noise-cancelling headphones and a 13.3-inch full HD monitor.In Economy Class, Recaro designed and built the new seats, offering greater comfort. Leveraging on advanced technology and ergonomics, seats offer more legroom and back support, with a six-way adjustable headrest with foldable wings. The Economy Class seat also features a more contemporary fabric seat cover design.An 11.1-inch touch-screen monitor eliminates the need for handsets to indulge in KrisWorld, Singapore Airlines award-winning in-flight entertainment system.The new A380 configuration will carry up to 471 customers in four classes of travel, with six Singapore Airlines Suites, 78 Business Class seats, 44 Premium Economy Class seats and 343 Economy Class seats.On every flight, regardless of cabin class, two things that passengers often praise (or complain about) are the carriers entertainment system and food.Singapore Airlines is introducing an industry first called myKrisWorld, a feature that allows you to bookmark and resume content, and save preferences for your next flight when you input your KrisFlyer membership number.If youre flying, say, Manila to Paris, and you begin watching a movie in Manila and before you finish it youve land in Singapore for a layover, you can resume your movie when you board your next flight, from Singapore to Paris.With the SingaporAir mobile app, you can also choose your inflight entertainment prior to your flight and transfer your selections to myKrisFlyer when youre onboard.Isnt that amazing?As for food, SIA has always been known for serving good food in all classes thanks to an international culinary panel composed of chefs from all over the world.With its Book the Cook service, you can select your main course ahead of your flight from Singapore.From Singaporean fare like chicken rice and laksa in Economy to more gourmet selections in the higher classes while enjoying a glass of Dom Perignon in your suite, SIA cuisine is a world away from airplane food.The significant investment that we are making with the introduction of new cabin products demonstrates our commitment to continued investment in products and services, our long-term approach to ensure we retain our leadership position, said Goh Choon Phong.* * *Visit the authors travel blog at www.findingmyway.net.

1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,17,0,6805330,0,0,"A newly released report shows that the Ontario government knew of mercury contamination at the Dryden mill, upstream from Grassy Narrows, in 1990. (Jody Porter/CBC)A new report shows the Ontario government knew nearly 30 years ago that a mill site upstream from Grassy Narrows First Nation was contaminated with mercury.Theres a continued liability on the province, Grassy Narrows chief Simon Fobister said. They said its going to clear itself up, but they never informed us that theres still mercury in the soil and they were aware of it.Well consider all our options right now, whether its political or legal.The confidential report was done by True Grit Consulting in 2016; the firm was tasked with determining whether mercury is still leaching into the Wabigoon River from the nearby Dryden mill site, which is located upstream from Grassy Narrows, where residents have shown signs of mercury poisoning for decades.Mercury visible in soil at siteThe report was independently reviewed by CBC News.The report states that the Ontario government was informed about visible mercury in the soil at the site as early as 1990, and that 2016 data is insufficient to determine with any certainty if mercury is still present and leaching into the river. True Grit recommends a followup investigation.Very disappointed that the Ontario government hasnt continued monitoring the leakage of mercury at the old Dryden mill, said Fobister. Weve always been informed that the mercury is contained, but to our surprise, according to this report, mercury is still in the soil and leaching into the river.We have been misinformed by the ministry.The mercury issue goes back decades, with reports that Reed Paper dumped several tons of mercury into the Wabigoon River in the 1960s and 1970s (the mill is currently operated by Domtar, which purchased the site in 2007 and commissioned the True Grit report).The elevated mercury levels in the river led to mercury poisoning among residents of downstream Indigenous communities, Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, who consumed fish caught in the Wabigoon River.Research done by Japanese experts shows that more than 90 per cent of the population in the communities show signs of mercury poisoning.Drums of contaminated soil removedThe True Grit report states that in 1990, mercury was observed in the soil beneath the mills chemical plant building as repairs were being made to a floor there. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment  currently the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC)  was notified, and conducted an inspection.Sampling was conducted and 35 drums of mercury-contaminated soil was removed. Further testing showed that contaminated soil remained in the area in amounts that exceeded MOECC criteria for cleanup activities, but further excavation was not considered feasible.The MOECC subsequently said that no further excavation would be needed, provided:an excavation policy be developedthe contaminated area be registered with the land titles officea plastic barrier be installed between the contaminated soil and clean backfill, anda study be undertaken to estimate the amount of mercury present.The True Grit study states that it appears that these requests were largely addressed by December 1991.Two potential contamination sourcesThe study identifies the contaminated soil found in 1990 as one potential source of ongoing mercury contamination of the Wabigoon River. Monitoring wells were installed in the vicinity; some of them have shown elevated levels of mercury, although data is only available for certain years.Its affecting the health of our people, and also it destroyed our commercial fishing and tourist operations  Simon Fobisher, chief of Grassy NarrowsFor example, sampling from some wells showed elevated mercury levels from 1999-2006, then testing stopped. The report does note that the mercury levels in the wells were generally decreasing during those years.The second potential source is a former effluent ditch, where mercury-contaminated effluent was discharged before entering the Wabigoon River in the 1970s.The ditch was closed and sealed in 1977 or 1978, and its precise location is unknown. No monitoring wells were installed in the ditch, the report says.Socio-economic damage to Grassy NarrowsHow many generations of our children are going to be affected by it? Fobister said. Its affecting the health of our people, and also it destroyed our commercial fishing and tourist operations.Theres a lot of socio-economic damage to our community.Overall, the report states that generally, True Grit found that available historical data indicates elevated levels of mercury were present in groundwater on the mill site, particularly around the former chemical plant building.However, the available data is limited, and it is not presently possible to make a firm conclusion whether or not mercury is still leaching into the Wabigoon River.True Grit recommended a supplemental investigation be conducted, one that would include the review of existing background information, a site inspection, the drilling of boreholes to facilitate the installation of new monitoring wells, and the collection of soil samples.In June, the province announced an $85-million cleanup of mercury near Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations.Fobister meeting with cabinet ministersFobister will be also be meeting with provincial and federal cabinet members at the end of November, and will be speaking with them about the report.MOECC representatives couldnt immediately be reached for comment.",Ontario knew about mercury contamination near Grassy Narrows in 1990: report – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

And scientists are now designing search engines of the future with the brain in mind  the fly brain in fact.How is the fly brain helping to develop search engines?The types of search engines the scientists are interested in are those that do similarity searches. Those are the ones that generate suggestions based on your past behaviour or online interests. They are often spectacularly wrong  like you just bought a John Mayer relaxing at home kinda song  how about this thumpa thumpa dance hall techno remix of Lil Kim?There is room for improvement in computer generated similarity searches  from recommended songs to apps to recipes. The current way to find recommendations also takes a lot of computing power.But flies do this type of search all the time, especially in terms of smells. A fly will encounter a lot of smells and some mean food and others mean flee. For example, a rotting banana means food. They then have to decide if a new smell, like a rotting kiwi, is similar enough to represent food. So they have to have a program in the brain to do a similarity search. The researchers found out what that was and were able to mimic it in computer software.How do the flies search for similar smells?The flies have a way of sensing smells in their brain that is a hierarchy of neurons. There are 50 smell-sensing brain cells called olfactory neurons. They first detect the chemical stimulus of a smell, then they distribute those signals across 50 projection neurons in a particular pattern and finally to 200 Kenyon cells. So the signal is expanded and spread out across the neurons until there is a unique pattern for a smell.The fact that they basically spread the information over a large number of cells allows a refinement of the information. Heres how Saket Navlakha from the Salk Institute for Integrative Biology explains it: Lets say you had a hundred people and you wanted to find some grouping of these people into clusters. And you take these hundred people and you put them into a very small crowded room. What the fly is doing is its taking these hundred people and spreading them out over a football field. You can imagine then that its really easy to identify groups and delineate the boundaries between groups in the really large space compared to this really compressed space.And of course, it works really well for identification of similarities, in this case in terms of smell.How do the computer programs that detect similarity work?Computers do it a totally different way. Instead of expanding the search area, or expanding the room, so to speak, computers try to narrow the scope of the search by putting similar items into buckets, effectively shrinking the room and filling it with similar stuff. And it works decently well, especially because we are rarely looking for exact versions.Computers do similarity searches by putting similar items into buckets, effectively shrinking the room and filling it with similar stuff. (Virginia Mayo/Associated Press)This is how Saket Navlakha explains it: If youre looking for images, then as long as they are close enough to what youre looking for, then the user is going to be happy. And so what this motivated was a different way of trying to solve this problem instead of comparing one at a time.So computers start with one image, like a rotting banana, and try to slowly narrow down the buckets where they would find things similar to that image, like the bucket labelled bananas.So we see two complete opposite strategies to accomplish the same thing: The fly tries to separate out the things to compare as far from one another as possible to really find the most accurate comparison.The computer tries to reduce down the number of possible things to compare the original to.How much more efficient is the fly search engine compared to our current computer ones?Thats the coolest part. The group that published in Science found that if they make a search algorithm that mimics the fly brains way of searching through data and compared it to a traditional search engine, the fly was more accurate given the same amount of computing power.Fruit flies are more accurate than traditional search engines given the same amount of computing power. (U.S. Department of Agriculture)They havent tested speed or efficiency yet, but theres all the indications that the fly brain way of searching data will be better at those too.Is the Fly Brain Search Engine going to replace Google?Its more likely that the Fly Brain Search Engine will be bought by Google. The team is already in talks to expand the prototype or proof-of-concept to a real application.

The teeth are all there  not just that one big tooth, but the grinding teeth are also there. [They] seem to show a lot of wear and tear on them, so I think it was an old beaver when it died.Exactly how old remains to be seen, but bits of petrified wood from the same area where the Castoroides fossil was recently found have been shown to be 44,000 years old, Young said.The fossil is on a wait list to be radio carbon dated, which should yield a more precise age estimate.The discoverer, who has chosen to remain anonymous, unearthed the bone in a gravel pit in southeastern Manitoba.Modern day beavers can weigh up to 70 kilograms. The ice age giant beaver may have weighed in at as much as 135 kilograms. (CBC)The person brought the bone into the museum over one lunch hour, freely admitting it might just be from a pig because it had a big tusk-like tooth on it, Young said.He met the person, who then unwrapped a series of bones that included a partially intact giant-beaver jaw. It had a vaguely familiar tooth still stuck at the end  only this one was ridged and thick, sharp, and much larger than the tooth of an average modern beaver.They recognized it was an odd creature. They had never heard of giant beavers, Young said. Sometimes you just get very odd things brought into the museum.He said one of the reasons why the discoverer didnt immediately see it for what it is relates to a problem of scale. Though it shares many of the same characteristics of a present-day beaver, the size discrepancy might make it hard for the average Canadian to make the connection.I was very excited, Young said, adding he and others at the museum quickly reached a consensus that this was from a giant beaver.A review of paleontological records revealed this to be just the fourth such giant-beaver bone discovered in Canadian history  and a first for Manitoba.I knew that we had none in our collection from Manitoba, genuine ones, because when we wanted to do an exhibit we had to buy copies, Young said.So clearly it was a new thing to our collection and therefore I thought it was probably a new thing to Manitoba, because  most of the ice age things that have been collected in Manitoba are in the collection of this museum.The recently unearthed giant beaver jaw bone, top, next to a modern-day beaver jaw shows just how much larger the ancient creature was compared to its present-day relative. (Graham Young/Manitoba Museum)Paleontologists generally believe giant beaver species ranged between 90 to 135 kilograms (200 to 300 pounds), Young said. Estimates put the average length of the extinct rodent at nearly two metres (greater than six feet long).To put that into perspective: the average weight and height of American men has been pegged at 195 pounds and five feet seven inches. And the modern North American beaver  the largest rodent on the continent  tips the scale at between 10 and 32 kilograms (or 20 to 70 pounds).Scientists believe the last group of giant beaver species went extinct near the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago.A close relative of the beavers that are now a fixture of the Canadian landscape existed at the same time as their comparatively massive cousins.This is such a rare and utterly unique fossil, Young said.As for the Manitoba specimen, Young says it became saturated during the thousands of years it rested beneath the water table.The fossil is being slowly aired out in a climate-controlled environment right now to ensure its around and on public display for generations to come.",That’s a big beaver bone: Ice age giant-beaver jaw 1st of its kind found in Manitoba – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Though technology has certainly brought the fiction closer to becoming reality, one ongoing challenge stands in the way of conquering space: the human body.The human body was built for life on Earth. Put us into space under microgravity and it reacts in unpleasant ways.As they soar into space, many astronauts experience nausea and even vomiting  not exactly a stellar start. When they return, they can experience blurred vision, headaches, muscle atrophy, weak bones and possibly even lung cancer from galactic cosmic radiation  the equivalent of 10 chest X-rays a day.Increased cancer riskAstronauts already face an increased risk of lung cancer due to radiation exposure. A recent study predicts that the cancer risk for astronauts voyaging to Mars will double.The biggest change [while living on the space station] is exposure to radiation. So that is increased by 100-fold compared to what we are exposed to here on Earth, said Raffi Kuyumjian, flight surgeon for the Canadian Space Agency. He worked with Chris Hadfield, before, during and after his five-month stint on the International Space Station from December 2012 to May 2013.The radiation exposure beyond low-Earth orbit is even higheritll be in the order of 1,000 times higher.Raffi Kuyumjian, a flight surgeon for the Canadian Space Agency who worked with Chris Hadfield, shown here, says the radiation exposure in space is about 1,000 higher than on Earth. (NASA)While no astronauts who have lived aboard the space station have reported having cancer, it may still be too early to tell.This may be something that shows up 10 to 15 years in time, once we have a bit of time behind missions and astronauts have grown a little bit older, Kuyumjian said.NASA is looking at ways of creating better shielding to block out the radiation, but so far, there is no definitive fix.You feel helplessIf theres anyone who can tell you about the challenges of living in space, its Scott Kelly. He spent 340 days in space together with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko as part of the One-Year Mission to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight.He was also part of NASA Twin Study that compared his physical changes to that of his former astronaut twin brother Mark, who remained on Earth.Scott (left) and Mark (right) Kelly were part of NASAs Twin Study that compared the effects of long-term spaceflight on Scott to living on Earth as Mark did for the duration of the mission. (NASA)In his new book Endurance, he talks about his first few days back on Earth and how difficult it was for his body to readjust. His legs swelled. He had headaches. His skin burned.But that wasnt the biggest challenge  that came while orbiting 400 kilometres above Earth.The hardest part for me was dealing with this idea that if something happened to my family on Earth, I couldnt come home, Kelly told CBC News.Its not the personal riskit was this idea that you kinda feel helpless.And he knows all about helplessness. In 2011, his sister-in-law, congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in Arizona. Kelly was aboard the International Space Station with two months left in his mission at the time.Astronaut Scott Kelly in Toronto to talk about his new book Endurance3:02Space flight surgeons and space agencies are acutely aware of the the psychological challenges space poses  and thats just with an average of six months on a space station. If humans are to go to Mars, theyll likely be away from loved ones for nearly two years at the least.Were trying to look at how this will affect the isolation aspect, Kuyumjian said.Then theres the lack of natural sunlight, which can affect moods.NASA is in the midst of retrofitting the ISS with light bulbs that change in frequency, with the day light mimicking natural light, with less blue light that can disrupt circadian rhythms. Astronauts must also take vitamin D supplements.Changing bodiesAnother change thats been noted since about 2011 is changes to astronauts eyesight. Some had to wear glasses after returning to Earth.Doctors noticed that the back of the eye was flattened, as though theres extra pressure in the brain that changes the geometry of the eye and point.I never  even after 340 days  felt completely normal.  Scott Kelly, NASA astronautThen there are muscle atrophy and changes in bone structure that can accompany time in space.Astronauts lose bone density and the very structure of their bones changes under microgravity.Human bones have evolved to fight against gravity. As astronauts exercise in space (to combat muscle atrophy, or the wasting of muscle), bone can reform. But without gravity, there is no longer a need for them to form in the same manner as on Earth.European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti exercises on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) in the Tranquility Node 3. This machine helps astronauts to combat muscle atrophy while in microgravity. (NASA)That could lead to weaker bones and the inability to avoid fractures or heal quickly.The density itself isnt the only issue: its the bone architecture, Kuyumjian said. The fact that the bone architecture is disturbed and were not getting that architecture back, that is probably lost for good.Kelly said that the longer you spend in space the more accustomed you became to the various changes.

The cause of death on the seventh right whale has been found to be inconclusive.In August, a 10-knot speed limit was put in the Gulf of St. Lawrence by the federal government, to prevent further right whales deaths and several ships have been fined for going over that speed limit.This past summer, whales also had to be freed from snow crab gear, including one saved by Joe Howlett, a 59-year-old fisherman from Campobello Island, N.B., who was killed during the rescue near Shippagan on July 10.Sixteen North Atlantic right whales have been found dead in both Canadian and U.S. waters this past summer. (Center for Coastal Studies/NOAA permit #14603)Fisheries and Oceans Canada estimates there are only about 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and the 16 whale deaths just this year have alarmed those trying to protect the endangered mammals.A few weeks ago, hundreds of whale researchers met in Halifax to discuss the critically endangered marine mammals being found dead this year in waters off eastern Canada and the United States.","Feds to consider using $400M fund, innovation prize to save North Atlantic right whales – MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

I havent been able to sleep, I havent been able to eat. Ive lost 17 pounds in the last two weeks.Russell says the stress has been so bad, his doctor has put him on antidepressants. Youre watching something that youve built, youre watching something that youve put together yourself be taken away.Grant Russell says holding liquidation sales at his Fort McMurray, Alta., Sears Hometown store is heartbreaking. (Grant Russell)Cash-strapped Sears Canada announced in June its laying of 2,900 staff and closing what now totals 54 stores as part of a court-supervised restructuring process.Seven of the locations on the chopping block are smaller Hometown stores, which are owned and operated by independent dealers. They sell Sears appliances and furniture, earning a commission on each sale.CBC News spoke with owners of five of the ill-fated Hometown stores  all located in Alberta. None of them, including Russell, wanted to close, and all but one said their store was consistently profitable.Completely helplessThe owners also claim that they arent being fairly compensated by Sears for the loss of their business. Thats because they signed contracts with the retailer stating that if the company terminated the deal early, theyd get compensation, based on six or 12 months commission.But because of the court-approved restructuring, the dealers say they wont be getting their cash.It does impact us significantly, says Russell.He estimates the six months of commission hes losing out on totals between $400,000 and $500,000. He also claims hes already lost tens of thousands of dollars in commission due to Searss current lack of inventory, and having to sell whats left in his shop at a discount during current liquidation sales.Grant Russell and six of his employees at the gallery he set up for local artists at his Sears Hometown store in Fort McMurray. (Grant Russell)Ive watched Sears wipe me out, says Russell. This is the first time that Im experiencing a complete business failure, and I feel completely helpless.Russell says store sales were good and that the business was an important part of the Fort McMurray community; he even set up a gallery in his shop where local artists could display and sell their work. Once his liquidation sales are finished later this month, the paintings will go, along with his nine employees.Liquidating our stores from my own perspective is a heartbreaking experience, says Russell.No respectShawn Nawaz also finds it painful to hold liquidation sales at his St. Albert, Alta., Hometown store.

I cant afford to stay here, says Nawaz, who at the time of his interview, was still sitting on about 20 large appliances.He showed CBC News his email correspondence with Sears Canada. In it, the retailer warns him if he closes his location early, hell be billed $500 for each unsold major appliance in his store.With only a small number of appliances left, Shawn Nawaz wants to close his Sears Hometown store now and cut his losses. (Shawn Nawaz)These people are bullying us at the moment, says Nawaz. Its killing me, putting me further in debt and more stress. Theres no respect left.Nawaz says he never wanted to close his store, which he has operated for almost nine years in total. But now that hes been dealt a blow by Sears, he wants nothing more than to sever ties with the retailer.I dont want to be here actually. Thats how I feel when I come to this place  when is this going to be over?Sears Canada told CBC News it doesnt discuss its business relationships with individual Hometown dealers. But it did say that deep financial troubles left it with no choice but to seek court protection from its creditors while it restructures and closes some stores.The retailer added that a number of factors were involved in deciding which stores to shut down, including performance, operating costs and the market it serves.While this led to a very unfortunate outcome for a number of our partners (and people), the company made these decisions so that it is best able to emerge from the [restructuring] process as a strong and viable retailer, said spokesperson Peter Block in an email.The explanation isnt good enough for disgruntled Hometown dealers. The five whom CBC News spoke with are now planning legal action to fight for compensation from Sears Canada.All of the dealers have been working in the best interest of Sears, says Russell.

The mayors son Rolando Jr. or Kerwin had testified that Marcos and several CIDG members were receiving drug payola from Espinosa.The Senate report provides a detailed description of the circumstances leading to the fatal shooting of Espinosa and Yap on Nov. 5 last year. Those details, aside from the conclusions of the Senate panels and the NBI, raise questions on the return to the police service of Marcos and his men.From the start, the reaction of President Duterte to the killing of a man he described as a narco politician was that Espinosa got what was coming to him. The President also promised to defend the police team that went to the sub-provincial jail ostensibly to serve a search warrant before dawn so they could look for drugs and guns in Espinosas jail cell.While the President has no control over the judiciary, he has authority over the Department of Justice, whose head Vitaliano Aguirre II recently downgraded the criminal charges against Marcos and his cohorts from murder to homicide, a bailable offense.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1The case remains pending, which should prevent reinstatement.

Editors of the journal that published the peer-reviewed study said they agreed to withdraw after finding evidence of incorrect data.It attacks the credibility of science  garbage science has an impact, said Jim Woodgett, investigator and director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, said of the soon-to-be-retracted paper.Elsevier is one of the worlds largest scientific publishing companies, overseeing the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry. In a statement, it said the data in two of the papers figures are incorrectly presented.The publisher also apologized to readers that those issues were not detected before publication.Elseviers policy on retraction says the electronic version of the journal will still link to the original paper, although it will be preceded by a retraction notice signed by the papers authors and the journals editors.The study would only be completely stripped if it was defamatory, the subject of a court order, or deemed a serious health risk if someone were to act upon it.Otherwise, the public will still be able to read and download the paper in its original form after clicking past the retraction notice  which Woodgett said is a problem.Chris Shaw, a professor of ophthalmology at UBC, co-authored the now-discredited paper. The journal that published the study said it found evidence of incorrect data. Shaw says he doesnt know how or why that may have happened.[Retraction] should be instantaneous, he said.The general public isnt typically well-versed in identifying what is scientific garbage, or pseudoscience, from what is real, he explained. So, the damage is done in terms of, this paper is out there  people who are not well-versed in science can easily get misled by it.Dr. Michael Gardam, an associate professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of Toronto, said much of the same.Theres actual harm thats happening as a result of these things, he said. There will be other people that will glom onto this that, no matter the retraction, no matter what.Dr. Michael Gardam. (CBC)Woodgett, who started his lab 30 years ago, said retraction protocol can vary from journal to journal. The researcher said some publishers will quietly and discreetly pull articles down, without offering an explanation as to why. Other times, he said, theyre simply slow to remove the publication  something he said doesnt do anybody any good.Somebody may have read the paper, quoted it, and then three or four months later, it gets retracted  but its still out there, Woodgett said. If a journal says theyre going to retract, then it should disappear  Unfortunately, thats not the case.A digital version of the UBC study was still available to download as a PDF as of Friday afternoon, nearly a month the retraction was agreed upon.Asked if he was concerned about the spread of allegedly falsified data, co-author Shaw said readers need to remember this paper was done on mice and take it with a grain of salt.Jim Woodgett, director of research of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.

An earlier report said she needed to be force-fed by their rescuers.Maidah Grace seems scared most of the time, but also to have discovered there are more decent people in the world than she knew; her world until last week consisted of two good brothers and two good parents and about 15 guards of increasing fear to her, Boyle said in his email to CBC.Linda and Patrick Boyle said Thursday that they couldnt be more excited about the familys return to Canada.

Referring to the first photo, she said that the most important details are the clock, the #62 written on Francos shirt, the posts date, and, most importantly, the caption.These small details almost went unnoticed, had it not been for Fatimas cracking of the mystery.While it is possible that it happened by chance, to Fatima, the factors were too close to be mere coincidence.Bakit ko naman icconnect tong mga to pwedeng coincidence lang naman kasi lahat, pero idk.. Just focus on the caption first, then isipin nyo yung araw kung kelan nya pinost itong photo nya. Hes waiting for something, the caption implies that something should have happened already pero di dumating, ano ba yung hinihintay nya? Ano bang gusto nyang magawa noon pa?She then added the figures up to end up with the date of Francos passing.23 (October 23)  12 (6 & 2 62 on his shirt)23 12-11Today is Nov 12, yesterday was 11.The day kung kelan sya namatay was November 11.11:11Fatima concluded that the numbers made her think that everybody has their own time, with a sad emoji.I dont want to sound crazy but kinonek ko lang po lahat, baka talagang oras na nya days early or before pa sya mag post nitong photo, kaso may gusto lang talaga siguro siyang magawa muna, baka na-prolong or extend lang yung time nya to say goodbye to his loved ones, but the numbers here really made me think that everybody has their own time. It so happened na dinecode ko lang yung nasa photo kasi may something talaga and the aura is kinda heavy for me. Pasensiya na po kayo kung medyo mahaba, kung may na-offend man, pasensiya na din po.via facebook.com/rizalbestvinesvia facebook.com/rizalbestvinesvia facebook.com/rizalbestvinesFatima declared with conviction that we cant escape our final day, ending the argument with the following: After all, we are just mortals and our final destiny is Death.I believe na, If its your time already, you cant say tomorrow na lang or please next year na lang, we cant fight the time, after all, we are just mortals and our final destiny is Death.She added another interpretation as an afterthought:P.S : Francos birth year was 1991, He died this year 2017.1991-2017262&6.

The act was so convincing that his girlfriend was clearly shocked when she saw her boyfriend was put in handcuffs and dragged in the streets and forced to kneel.The officer handed the 'warrant' to the girlfriend which of course is not a real arrest warrant but a note says ""Will You Marry Me?"".Jasmine Ferreras was confused for a moment trying to make out the words written in the supposed warrant.

He only wanted to improve his nose line but it ballooned up instead.Neil Stephen Asunto shares on his Facebook account how he paid only 20 pesos (.39 cents) to a shady person that he didn't even know the name, to do a supposed enhancement procedure on his nose. He said that he wanted to look like South Korean star Lee Min Ho with sharp nose but instead of edges, he got a big rounded and awkward looking one in the middle of his face.He said that it was baking soda and petroleum jelly the anonymous 'surgeon injected' into to his nose. Perhaps his better judgement was clouded by his desire to look even better by that time, he did not find the surgeon and the procedure itself suspicious.Asunto also recounts on his social media posts that he often gets bullied by other people because of his now ruined nose but he is still holding up good and is optimistic that his nose can still be fixed.Here's the full text of Asunto's post:Although this story may offer a lesson of two for others to learn we must look at it with curious eyes.

You're probably wondering how the thieves managed to steal both phone and charger, right? Well, phone snatchers in Manila are that good in swiping things that don't belong to them and the items were inside the victim's backpack.With a sleight of the hand, netizen Von Joshua Nicolas lost his phone to the two female perpetrators while waiting for the bus near a footbridge. Fortunately, he had friends with him who noticed a woman opened his bag but he was unsure how to react because it was a woman. He eventually told Von Joshua of what had just transpired while the women were walking away.They caught up with the culprits at a nearby eatery where Nicolas confronted the two women asking them to give him back his phone and charger and a wallet from one other victim who was also with them.Not easily fazed by the victims demand, the women, who were siblings, repeatedly denied the allegation, but when pressed to empty their pockets, the women walked out. Man, they always do that when they're losing the argument.Anyway, the victims were eager to get back their things so they followed the women and continued pressing the woman to give it up. The women broke into a trot. The men, who were the victims, followed then it was a full speed chased now.One of the perps finally gave up Nicolas' phone. The victim (who's a man by the way) picked it up and started what all normal theft victims would do to the perpetrator:record a video.It can be seen in the video that the victim was chasing the alleged thieves in the middle of heavily trafficked highway. At one point one of the women told him to stop being maarte na because he got his phone back na.But no, it's not over, yet. ""Where's the damn charger, woman?"", said Von Joshua in his mind. ""Give it up or I will repeatedly punch you in the teeth like you are man"", he might have added. But no. Von Joshua chose to do right thing and that was to ask 'why?' and do nothing violent to the women. Besides, one of them is pregnant.The incident was already reported to the police according to the victim's post below:",Video of Female Cellphone Thieves Being Chased By Victim Goes Viral

Childrens Challenge to Government Through songs and dances, around thirty children presented their issues and concerns to the government officials present during the event.They called for inclusion of childrens agenda in government programs. Aina Pachoco, a student of Arsenio Santos Memorial Elementary School in Calumpit, Bulacan, led all the guests in pledging for their commitment to walk the talk, saying that what transpired should truly redound to the full protection of children.Sana po, maging totoo po lahat nang napagusapan, para sa aming mga bata, Pachoco said. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Child Participation in DRR Activities At the forum, a memorandum of agreement (MoA) was signed by Ned Olney, Country Director of Save the Children Philippine Country Office and DILG Secretary Mar Roxas.Co-signing the MOA were 11 year old Marvin Sambilay, and Monica Baltero, 15 years old, both residing in Bulacan, one of the perennially affected provinces during calamities. DILG Director for national barangay operations, Leocadio Trovela, represented Secretary Roxas during the affair. DepEd regional director Isabelita Borres and DENR Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia witnessed the ceremony.The two agencies are still finalizing their separate MoAs with the NGO, but has already committed in principle, to adopt the Australian government-funded, ENCORE project. The agreement sought to formalize the commitment of various government leaders and representatives of non-governmental and people's organizations on the need for children's participation in DRR activities as a ""shared responsibility"" by all sectors of Philippine society.Muntinlupa City mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan Provincial Administrator Eugenio Payongayong, together with several mayors of the province, were also present as their local governments are the immediate target beneficiaries of the project. Olney said, ""Our recently-signed document would save and protect the lives of many children.Before there was only a legal and nominal recognition to the role of children in disaster risk reduction with Section 14 of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction Management Act of 2010.Today, we have the commitment of important sectors in society - especially those in government - to ensure the participation of children in assessing hazards and vulnerabilities in their communities.There are so many things that have to be done in order to create and maintain disaster-resilient communities. So much work can be spread out, even to children, with their meaningful contributions to disaster risk reduction programs.We demonstrate this in our child-centered and child-led DRR initiatives in our pilot areas for the ENCoRe Program in Bulacan and in Muntinlupa,"" Olney added.Government Officials vow Promotion of ""Child-Centered DRR"" Government officials led by Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG) Director Leocadio Trovela of the national barangay operations, Department of Education (DepEd) Regional Director Isabelita Borres and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia, all expressed their support to the program.The international NGO said people who underwent drills and seminars on disaster awareness are more likely to survive emergencies and natural calamities.Reaction from LGU beneficiaries of the EnCoRe Program The forum, which marks the second phase of the EnCoRe program, was previously focused on just two pilot areas: Bulacan and Muntinlupa. Both areas have been identified ""red"" in the hazard map of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC).Mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan administrator Eugenio Payongayong, took turns in lauding the project that would immediately benefit their constituents.For More info/media inquiries: PLEASE CONTACT: Edchelle Flores, Communications Assistant Enhancing the Resilience of Urban Communities to Disasters and Climate Change Project Mobile: +63 9168714981, Skype: edchelleflores, Email: Edchelle.Flores@savethechildren.org Lany dela Cruz Communications Officer | +63 09255556290 Save the Children Philippine Country Office, 2F Midland Bldg. 1040 EDSA, Magallanes Village, Makati City, Tel. +632 8532142About Save The Children:Save the Children is the worlds leading independent organization for children.

1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,32,0,5306050,0,0,"Three days before the Barangay Elections, the Teachers Dignity Coalition (TDC) made a final appeal to the Comelec for their demands that include higher compensation package, assurance of security and legal protection for the teachers who will sit as Board of Election Tellers (BET) on Mondays village election. The group expressed dismay because according to them, the Comelec seems to ignore their request for a meeting they have submitted as early as mid-August.Teachers will work for almost 24 hours or even more, from the time of distribution of election materials in the respective Comelec centers at early dawn of Monday up to the completion of all the tasks that usually up until the morning of the next day. Benjo Basas, the groups national chairperson said. Yet teachers are only paid half the amount of the honorarium in the last automated elections held in May. He continued.Basas said that manual elections like the one in Monday would expose the teachers in more possible errors, physical and mental fatigue, health risks, legal trouble and threats of harassment and physical attck. Thus, according to him, teachers deserve more than the total of P2, 500.00. The TDC proposes a payment of at least P4, 000.00, the total amount Comelec paid the teachers who sit as members of BEI last May.Basas also noted that the Comelec still failed to review and implement its legal mandate that prohibits the appointment of teachers who are not registered voters in the city or municipality as members of the BET.Both the election code and the subsequent Comelec Resolutions including the one for this October 28 Barangay polls prohibit the non-registered voters of the locality to sit as members of election tellers, yet the Comelec, in many instances allowed this to happen. Our teachers who are actually compelled to do this duty may face a possible election offense. Basas explained.Last week, teachers of Manila raised this issue and ask a Comelec representative during the training in Araullo High School, the Comelec personnel agreed that indeed there may be a violation but told them to address the concern to the Comelec national office.Aside from these two issues of compensation and legal protection, the group also appeal to the Comelec and the national government to ensure that teachers will be protected against physical harm. Basas noted that Barangay elections, most of the time, are most intense and tensionable due mainly to the clannish nature of Philippine villages and the opposing candidates and their supporters are coming from the same grassroots localities, some are actually blood relatives.We call on the Comelec to ensure the visibility of law enforcement authorities in areas they declared as election hot spots, from the start of the teachers work until they have finished all the tasks including the transportation of election paraphernalia from Comelec centers to polling places and vise versa. Basas said.Basas believe that the presence of law enforcers may deter those who are planning to disrupt the process thru violence, tension and disorder on election day.The problem with the bad politics and ailing electoral system is, everything may be blamed to the teachers, the front liners in elections, as if we have a direct stake in it. Basas lamented. We are the hapless victims of pre-election harassment, we cannot just leave the polling precincts whenever violence erupts on election day and after the polls, we are also subjects of electoral protests filed by the losing candidates.Basas added that most of the time, they face these difficulties alone for the DepEd has no readily available legal assistance and the Comelec serves as prosecutors in election-related cases.We appeal to the candidates and the general public to please spare the teachers. We do this task because we consider this as our patriotic duty, aside from this is our mandated work as public school teachers. However, given the choice, many of us would be opted not to sit as BET and would not risk our profession, our safety, our limbs or even our lives.The TDC is one of the most active organizations advocating the amendment to election laws to effect the relief of teachers from hazardous non-teaching related assignments especially poll duties and make these optional.",Pinoy News Blogger

The DDS OFW was telling the German guy that he supports Duterte and the good things Duterte is doing for the country not being reported by mainstream media. A white girl overheard the conversation. She butt in the conversation and asked what he felt for those people being slaughtered in Dutertes drug war campaign. The girl created a scene in the bus, shouting that she didnt want to be in the same bus with the person who supports a mass murderer.Sasot became more worried for the safety of the Duterte supporters in Europe, because some of them were being accused as fascists and when you were labeled like that, a group like Antifa might target you for assassination.The anarchist and anti-fascist group Antifa, preparing for a riot.Ive heard stories like these  overseas Filipinos being humiliated and harassed not online but IN PUBLIC SPACES for supporting Duterte. Theres also a real danger to ones life for being tagged a fascist for supporting Duterte. Alam niyo bang sa Europe ay may mga grupong who find it legitimate to inflict violence against those who are deemed fascists? Yup, the Antifa of Europe (see: http://reason.com//antifa-has-backed-its-message-with-viole). For some anarchists groups, fascists are legitimate targets for assassination.The Pro-Duterte blogger believes that the reason why the foreigners harassed the Duterte OFW supporters was the bad portrayal of the media against President Rodrigo Duterte.How exactly these foreigners became this angry towards Duterte supporters? How exactly these foreigners paint Duterte supporters as fascists? Where are they getting their information about whats going on in the Philippines? The answer is simple: International news sources such as the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera. These powerful global news agencies only narrate a single story about whats going on in the Philippines. And that story is the one being peddled by the opposition. No, contrary to what Yellowtards, some Philippine mainstream media, and the context-less analysis of a historian in De La Salle, Im not begging to be interviewed by BBC. By using the Jover Laurio incident, I am highlighting how BBC is complicit in propagating the version of events of the opposition to the world. The biased reporting of powerful global news agencies like BBC help create the consciousness that provoked that white girl to create a scene against a Filipino for simply supporting Duterte. Bago kasi dumakdak about what happened between Jonathan Head and I alamin muna ang KONTEKSTO ng mainit na pag-uusap namin na iyon.Sasot became controversial after she confronted Jonathan Head, a journalist from BBC News for featuring a minor blogger like Jover Laurio.Sasot also criticized the articles wrote by Head, which badly portrayed the President and the war against illegal drugs in the Philippines.",Blogger explains how bad news by international media about Duterte resulted to the harrassment of OFWs
1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,191,2733,161626,11108,0,"Blogger Sass Rogando Sasot became passionate in expressing her disappointment to the BBC journalist that she confronted at the International Media Center in Conrad Hotel Manila Monday.Jonathan Head was spotted by the Pro-Duterte blogger during the ASEAN Summit in the Philippines, so she didnt let the opportunity escape and she confronted the journalist that she criticized in her blog several years ago.Sass questioned how BBC News, an international news organization, was able to interview blogger Jover Laurio of Pinoy Ako Blog who libeled her several times despite of being just a very minor blogger in the Philippines.How is it possible, that Jover Laurio, a very minor blogger in the Philippines, was featured by the BBC in order to defend herself against the people who outed her identity but not someone like me? Sasot said.She also explained to Head the Jover Laurio became infamous for libeling people mostly Duterte supporters in her blog.Sasot started to became emotional when she narrated how the international media focused about the alleged troll network of the Duterte administration while they do not care about the anti-Duterte bloggers who libeled people.You just insulted, not just me..but millions of followers and supporters of the President, Sasot said.Do you know that millions of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) are doing everything, in order to combat the lies peddled by mainstream media? she added.Sass also asked Head the contact numbers of the BBC staff behind the interview of Jover Laurio.But whos Jonathan Head and why Sasot confronted her?Last year, Sass Rogando Sasot shared several articles of BBCs Jonathan Head and criticized the journalist for being critical with the uterte administration.One of the first post of Sasot about Head is about the interview of the BBC journalist on a self-proclaimed vigilante who admitted that her job is to kill drug leaders.Sasot described the article of BBC as disgusting and she believes that the article written by Jonathan Head was a possible drug cartel propagandaShe also questioned how Jonathan Head interviewed a drug pusher whos on the run and already mistrusted anyone.1. If Roger is on the run, how did Jonathan Head find him? 2. Who found Roger for Jonathan Head? 3. If Roger doesnt trust anyone, as he confessed, how did Jonathan Head earn his trust? Sassot said in her post last year.Because of this, Sass Rogando Sasot joked that Jonathan Head might be more competent than the former Justice Secretary Leila De Lima because the BBC journalist was able to find a member of the death squad that allegedly linked to President Rodrigo Duterte.She also urged her followers to report Jonathan Heads article on BBC News.After Sasot criticized Jonathan Head for his article about so called deathsquads the pro-Duterte blogger shared another article of the BBC Journalist.That time, Head described Mar Roxas, the political nemesis of President Duterte as By all accounts, a decent and capable politicianSasot claimed that Jonathan Head praised Mar Roxas while the journalist badly portrayed the Duterte and his supporters in his article.The BBC journalist who finally responded to the criticisms of Sasot against him denied the accusation of the pro-Duterte blogger.Sorry but that is rubbish. I dont know Roxas, have never met him, and have no stake in Filipino politics. That was a mild comment which deserves no such interpretation, and completely ignores what many people told me was an unreasonably favorable view of Duterte in my reporting in May. Jonathan Head told Sass.In response, Sasot told Jonathan Head that his article is the real rubbish because the journalist insinuating that the lady-assassin that she interviewed is doing her job as support to President Dutertes war against illegal drugs.Your article was rubbish, Mr Jonathan Head. The woman you interviewed is clearly hired by the police who is obviously part of a drug syndicate in the Philippines! Yet you kept on insinuating that this assassin is doing it in support of Dutertes war on drugs. Sass said.That article is severely misleading. At one point it said the killer was hired to kill a pusher who did not pay his debts (drug sales?), next thing the article insinuated that it was Duterte who indirectly encouraged her. And then, you were able to interview a drug pusher on the run and who mistrusts anyone? I have a bridge for sale Mr Head. she added.Sass also added several questions to Jonathan Head which the journalist didnt replied.Jonathan Head So tell us, were you really able to verify that the woman you interviewed was indeed an assassin??? Do you really want us to believe you that you ACTUALLY verified that her claims were true???

Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victims family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acostas statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12: to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accuseds guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Estrella and Aurora were found lifeless and naked in different parts of the house. The three children were then found inside a locked room also dead from stab wounds. They were found by Carlos, Estrellas husband who just came home from his night duty as a security guard in a bank in Makati City.One of the three suspects surrendered himself to the authorities as his conscience was haunting him and he regretted the crime that he did.

Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victims family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acostas statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12: to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accuseds guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017.

She was arrested and detained on February 23, 2017, also for drug charges.

President Rodrigo Duterte says the guns will be used to fight against the terrorists in Mindanao, where martial law still reigns. The first batch of military equipment came in four cargo planes, worth an estimated 590 million, and were turned over to the Philippine government at Clark Airbase, Pampanga. President Duterte was quick to express his gratitude to the Chinese government for their aid against the ISIS-aligned militants currently besieging Marawi City.To Ambassador Zhao, please relate our sincerest thanks to President Xi Jinping and the government of the Peoples Republic of China for its military aid package I will receive today in behalf of the Philippine government, he said. The Philippines commander-in-chief said this contract was the dawn of a new era of Philippine-Chinese relations. Duterte was, of course, referring to the several new business agreements between the Philippines and China. The Philippine head of state met with Chinese President Xi Jinping many times in the past. President Duterte said: This not only strengthens our countrys commitment to support each other during times of need, but also highlights the dawn of a new era in Philippine-Chinese relations. Your Excellency, Mr. President, I know you are fighting terrorism, ISIS-related terrorism in the south. China is also a victim of terrorism. The ambassador added that a second batch of weapons will be sent to the Philippines within the coming months. Reportedly, over 71 government troops and 299 Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Marawi City. 246,000 citizens of Marawi have been displaced due to the conflict.Loading...So what can you say about this one?

A very bad boy who gets excited by incensing people, annoying them and sparking discord in an already divided country.Oooh, Digong, youre so bad you should be spanked.You are not even officially President yet, but you certainly dont disappoint. Every day you give it to us, harder, deeper than the last time.You were annoyed that you, as Mayor, were not given first dibs to an Australian missionary. You cursed the Pope. And then admonished the United Nations, the multi-agency group that is one of the Philippiness largest donors. My eyes cannot help but widen each time you brazenly show us that no one could possibly be bigger than you.Whenever you display your manhood like that, it makes me bite my lower lip in anticipation.

President Bill Clinton pleaded for clemency, hence the sentence was lessened to just 4, after which the young Mr. Fay was deported back to the United States.I remember the protestations of the west against the cruelty of this kind of corporal punishment (although there were some folks that were totally in favor of it). Afternoon television programs featured it. People Magazine wrote an article on the young Mr. Fay. The photograph used made him look vulnerable, more like a child than someone on the verge of manhood.However, in Singapore, after the sentence was pronounced, many people interviewed for the news were proud of their country, that they were this strict in meting out punishment for crimes against the state and its people. Plus, cars are extremely expensive, costing at least twice the amount it normally would in the US. So of course the anger over them getting keyed is high as well.Moral of the story: obey the rules of the country you live in or visit. Render no destruction to property, public or private. All visitors are subject to the same laws as its residents.It was this kind of strictness that I yearned for here in the Philippines all those years ago. And now my mind is thinking of the word perhaps.Perhaps if government was more strict back thenPerhaps if the war on drugs began much earlierPerhaps if everyone was less apathetic and more sympathetic and empathetic towards one anotherPerhaps Perhaps PerhapsSo now here we are.This is on all of us. Were all in this together. Its pointless to stand on one side and place all the blame on someone that isnt us. WE all did this. All of us. So its going to take all of us to fix it"".Solidarity!

Everyone was taken aback except from the chair, Senator Leila De Lima and Senator Antonio Trillanes. Knowing the history of both senator and Duterte, it has been easily connected to different accusations of subversive propaganda from senators who support the President's war against drugs.The witness, Edgar Matobato, claims to be part of the Davao Death Squad who assassinates for Duterte back when he was still Mayor of Davao City. However, many senators questioned the credibility of the witness and shooted him with many questions to test his honesty.One of these is Sen. Tito Sotto who seemingly drove to a point that the witness was 'fake'. Firstly, he asked Matobato if there are any other witnesses that can collaborate with all the things he revealed. Matobato answered none as other witnesses are afraid to come out. He asked then if the witness has already signed a sworn statement or an affidavit regarding his statements. This was interrupted by De Lima saying that the Office of the Chair will assist in making an affidavit for the witness after the hearing. But when Sotto asked as to who arranged his arrival as witness in the senate. Matobato immediately answered that he is not going to reveal who for the safety of that person. When Sotto repeated the questioned, Matobato quickly changed answer saying he doesn't know who arranged for him to get there.Well, we trust that the truth shall come out soon.",BREAKING NEWS!

Opppsss!!!Out of the remaining 400,000 tons we do not know how much remains. We know there was an effort to do a major  disappearing act when the old Central Bank morphed into the new Bangko Sentral Pilipinas- but a recent decision of the SUPREME COURT ( Banco Filipino versus BSP ) has upheld that BSP is responsible for the liabilities of the old Central Bank.The POINT is that ultimately , a complete accounting should show where ALL of the original 720, 000 tons WENT- not to mention estimated 1.2 MILLION tons of Yamashita treasure ( combined German and Japanese plunder) identified above ( that is very nearly TWO MILLION TONS OF GOLD worth more than $38 TRILLION at todays price 2006)The phony, CIA backed EDSA  PEOPLE POWER  exhibition of 1986 had one primary purpose and that was to take this vast QUANTITY OF GOLD from the Philippines and the FILIPINO PEOPLE for the benefit of the INTERNATIONAL BANKING CARTEL to enslave mankind.WHAT ABOUT FR. DIAZ COMMISSION SHARED WITH FERDINAND MARCOS?When Fr. Jose Antonio Diaz , died in 1974 all the 30% COMMISSION in gold became the legendary  MARCOS GOLD . After providing for his family in Marcos  Letter of Instruction, the whole wealth derived from this was supposed to be given to the FILIPINO PEOPLE . This was the MARCOS WEALTH that some POLITICIAN and CHURCHMEN kept on saying was the: ILL  GOTTEN  Marcos Wealth..WHY THIS WEALTH HAS BEEN LABELED  ILL  GOTTEN  a little further along in our STUDY , that unti today is in MARCOS SECRET ACCOUNTS. On April 9, 1973 Marcos said: MY EARTHLY GOODS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE CUSTODY AND FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MARCOS FOUNDATION DEDICATED TO THE WELFARE OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE.In his GRAND PLAN, MARCOS wanted to RE ESTABLISHED the former grandeur of MAHARLIKA and the whole region of SOUTHEAST ASIA , the former MALAYAN EMPIRE.In June 1983, Marcos appeared before the First World leaders in Toronto. He announced his plan to boost economy of the Southeast Asia Region by creating ASIAN DOLLAR. This would be backed up by the 400,000 metric tons of gold in Central Bank.The ASIAN DOLLAR , backed up by the two thirds of all gold in the world that was in the Maharlika. Would made the Maharlika money more valuable and stronger that the American dollar. This was his vision to raise Southeast Asia to be par with the rest of the first world countries.There is plenty of solid evidence of a program MARCOS worked on with American President Ronald Reagan, which referred to as the ABL ( ANG BAGONG LIPUNAN) program. Under this program some 250 sets of gold , documentation and related ABL currency were to be shipped to various countries around the world.-WHAT BECAME OF THE REMAINING 400,000 metric TONS PERTAINING TO THE TAGEAN  TALLANO CLAN and where is it today?To this day, the 400,000 metric tons of GOLD are still in the CENTRAL BANK in East Avenue , Quezon City. NOBODY CAN MOVE it because Marcos insured it with the LLOYDS OF LONDON and its agents are guarding it.-BUT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ITS EXISTENCE.Not only have SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS of the Philippines failed to ACKNOWLEDGE the existence of the GOLD, they have CONSPIRED to keep this information from being KNOWN to the Filipino People.We assume this is because they have been working at ways to convert the GOLD for their own selfish gain, probably in conspiracy with the International Banking Cartel.Immediately after Ferdinand Marcos was REMOVED from the office by a U.S MILITARY helicopter , the NEWLY installed PRESIDENT CORAZON AQUINO , formed the PCGG- Presidential Commission on Good Government, PURPORTEDLY to go after the Marcos  ILL GOTTEN WEALTH. IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CONSPIRATORS THAT THIS WEALTH SHOULD BE LABELLED ~~ILL  GOTTEN~~ even though, as has already been shown , MR MARCOS was in his OWN RIGHT the WEALTHIEST MAN on the face of the EARTH and had absolutely no need to take anything from anyone.A decision of the FEDERAL SUPREME COURT OF SWITZERLAND dated December 21,1990 said By decision of May 29,1986 , the attorney general of District of Zurich accepted in principle to the legal assistance requested by the PHILIPPINES and invited all the banks of the City of Zurich to FREEZE IMMEDIATELY all the accounts, deposits or safes of the persons, companies or foundations ( of MARCOS) in the order.THE ACCOUNTS WERE FROZEN at the request of the government of the Philippines and the PCGG has ensured they have remained FROZEN to this day.This is all a GRAND SCHEME OR SCAM. BLINDED Filipinos must keep repeating that MARCOS was a THEIF ( MAGNANAKAW) so that those HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of DOLLARS of Marcos Money will remain FROZEN and not be given to them for their use..Consequently, they MUST CONSTANTLY BORROW MONEY from International Monetary Fund( IMF) and World Bank ( WB) with SO MUCH INTEREST so that this COUNTRY WILL REMAIN A SLAVE and SHACKLED to the foreign powers.HISTORY will show that the money was not stashed away and inaccessible but AVAILABLE to truly deserving Filipinos.There was NOTHING SECRET about Marcos Accounts. These ACCOUNTS were ONLY MADE SECRET by some people in the government so that the PUBLIC would not know its REAL STORY.GOLD FOR GOLD , DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, this country , the Maharlika is the RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.During a talk show in U.S TV the week following the bombing of the New York Twin Towers, PRES BUSH was asked this question:WHICH IS THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TODAY ? With a smile he said : THE PHILIPPINES, Marcos knew it, but he could not talk.At the time they made sure that MARCOS would not longer talk. After kidnapping him from Malacanang , they put him in a golden prison in HawaiiAccording to Global Finance, the richest country in the world, based on gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing-power-parity (PPP) per capita, is Qatar, second Luxembourg, and third Singapore.

Bruce Rivera posted on Facebook the open letter of the anonymous lawyer saying that as the media, international entities, and Yellows try to bring down the President, Filipinos should become Dutertes wind beneath his wings.In the first place, it was the Filipinos who asked Duterte a favor to fix the ailing nation, thus, as he continues to execute the task, the support must remain solid in the face of adversaries like powerful traditional politicians (trapos),  business elites, ignorant international entities,  and all too mighty disgraced media.The anonymous lawyer cited media as the first enemy that has converted its watchdog role into hound dogs and werewolves. Instead of safeguarding public interest, it continues to destabilize the Philippines by highlighting the negativities about Duterte whether it is credible information or not.ABS CBN, GMA, Rappler, and international media may claim to be practicing their mandate as the Fourth Estate, but the lawyer said that nowhere in the world is that mandate institutionally enshrined.International figures such as the UsS, United Nations, European Union, and other foreign communities have done their part in contributing to the attack on Dutertes presidency.They take in the twisted figures reported by local media and use it as basis to structure arguments, accusations, and resolutions against the President.In the anonymous lawyers full post on Riveras Facebook, it said,""Dear Filipinos,This writer is just an ordinary citizen of the Philippines. One among the more than 100 million people being governed by President Rodrigo Duterte and I know my voice is negligible but I decided to make a stand hoping that the rest of the greater majority of the Filipino who believes in Duterte would provide the wind in his sails amidst the barrage of attacks against him from all fronts.WE ASKED HIM THIS FAVORAre we really that oblivious of the fact that we pleaded for President Duterte to run for office? A song prior to the election even assured him that should his feet be weary and tired from running, that we shall be the wind beneath his wings. This is the opportune moment for us to make good such assurance to the good President. Now more than ever, he needs the resolute voice, protection and support of the vast majority of Filipinos as he engages the very few yet powerful traditional politicians ( trapos ), the business elites who are devoid of patriotic hearts, the ignorant international entities and of course the all too mighty disgraced media. If we as a nation fail to rally behind this once in a lifetime President, then we are deserving of a decayed nation and we lose every right to complain about our plight.THE MEDIAWhere do you source your abundant malevolence? How do you replenish your zest for ignorance and want of conscience? Can all of you still look at the mirror and see a reflection of a decent soul?All of you keep harping on Extra Judicial Killing as if it is like a daily routine , similar to brushing your teeth that thrice a day you have to relegate this into the spot light. You hide under the cloak of being SELF PROCLAIMED WATCH DOGS, but do you really know that nowhere in Journalism Principles in the world does that concept exist nor has it ever been institutionally enshrined? In the words of President Duterte,  Where the Hell did you ever get that thought? My answer? Precisely from HELL!Even assuming for the sake of argument that you are watch dogs as you proclaim to be, then you have the obligation to watch and be balanced and responsible. Such is not the case with you ABS CBN, GMA 7, Rappler and International Media. You are acting more like hound dogs and werewolves. In many occasions you acted worst than vultures.Where has the dignity and prudence of Journalism gone? You are not Journalists . You can all be beaten by decent University Students in how they think and handle themselves and yet you wallow in the delusion that you are all professionals. Really now? Professionals ? Questions about gums? Questions about why the President went to China ? Questions about why the President is threatening criminals ? Questions about why the President is putting his foot down on America? Do you really not comprehend or you just refuse to comprehend? Or you are really devoid of the mental capacity to understand a simple issue? If it is the latter, then you dont have any business reporting because you are belching and feeding people polluted information.You focus on trivial matters and matters which you believe can sell your stories You magnify things and demonize the President because it is in accord with the wishes of your Masters and it will sell your convoluted stories.You ought to be ashamed of even breathing as you have abandoned your responsibility to give an objective news reporting. Yes, you can report bad news but look at your percentage over good news. If you can claim they are balanced, then the more than 95% of Filipinos who support the President, including this writer should be condemned and executed. Your reckless abandon in typing your articles which we call trash have painted our country in bad light all over the world. You can and should claim authorship of that. When this country goes to the drain, I hope you can all sleep well dear media moguls and your paid assassins. Free Speech is not a license and you do not own a franchise of what you think is right for our country.THE USA, UN , EU and the Rest of the International Watch DogWe do not meddle in your affairs and we expect the same courtesy. It is however revolting to realize that you are so sanctimonious in stamping your unsolicited authority over us as if we are really a nation undeserving of respect. You blindly swallow the reports of media as hook line and sinker and marches on the offensive against our President. Has your success in bedeviling Marcos in the past inspired you to try it again? Are we really like a nation of mendicants that you choke for fun? Stop managing our nation and leave us in standing up with dignity no matter how hard and how tedious it would be.Follow this simple principle: Only those with clean hands can have moral authority to dictate upon others. Question: DO YOU HAVE CLEAN HANDS ?If you answer in the affirmative, then you are indeed one bunch of self righteous idiots!To the YellowtardsYou have raped the nation for so long and you have seriously believed that you can continuously fool and brainwash a nation. Reality will hit all of you hard when you realize that your antics will no longer slave the people. We had enough of you. You have managed to drive the Philippines to the depths of hell after you orchestrated the downfall of Marcos and now you are at it again with President Duterte.Divine justice has a great way of finding you back and lashing at you hard. The people will not allow any of you anymore to do the same tricks your false heroes like Cory and Ninoy did to Marcos. President Duterte is the Philippine President , he is our President and he and not you will define our destiny. So to the Aquinos and your hound dogs ( Trillianes, De Lima, Hontiveros , Drillon , Lagman, Pangilinan and the usurper of the VP position, Robredo ) , we suggest you enjoy your last days in glory because your political stock will go down the drain in front of your very eyes because WE ARE NOW NOT ONLY AN AWAKENED NATION, but we are a DETERMINED PROTECTOR OF CHANGETo the People of the PhilippinesPresident Duterte has been non-stop. One need not be a doctor to see the exhaustion in his eyes. He has a nation to heal and discipline and yet he is bombarded everyday by these people who care less about the repercussions of their acts. May we shield him and provide him inspiration that is because the seat he reluctantly occupies is a very lonely and thankless one.We complain as a nation why we have fallen behind other Asian Countries but at the same time we fail to acknowledge that these countries we envy metamorphosed owing to discipline and strong governance. We were ahead of Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in the years of old and now all we see are the smoke from the tailpipe of their progress. Do we still honestly believe that Vietnam is still behind us? If we do, then we are really a one big hallucinating nation because Vietnam had already made strides that overtook us by leaps and bounds. Should Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos catch up on us, then we really are a nation of loud mouths with no future. These people harping on Human rights and freedom have a tailored self serving definition of which and they are the same people who have for years supported the yellow bloods and look where it has brought us ? To the dumps.If we cannot rally behind the President, if we cannot realize how special this man is to the Philippines and if we fail to acknowledge why the Lord moved his hands to place him in power, then let us be human enough to let President Duterte go back to his private life because it is unfair for him to be assassinated or for him to lose his health just because he wanted a better nation for us. Let us not be selfish. Let the man go and let us all be resigned to the fact that we are a doomed nation and the perpetual doormat of Asia and the world.However, should we believe in the man and the good Lord above and should we really desire a new Philippines, let our little voices be lumped together and be a force to reckon with.I want a better Philippines. We only have one chance at this .I want to be counted in the army of civilians for President Duterte. Do you?""",Public Trending

0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,8,0,2358477,0,0,"Manila Times writer Rigoberto Tiglao broke down how the Rufino-Prieto family owes almost Php 3 billion to the Filipinos in taxes from their Mile Long prime property in Makati and Dunkin Donuts enterprise.If governments claims are valid, and its figures accurate, the Rufino/Prietos liabilities through their firm Sunvar Realty and Development Corp. would be this P1.8 billion, plus the P1.5 billion alleged tax evasion by another firm they own, Dunkin Donuts, Tiglao explainedWith the amount of almost Php 3 billion, Rufino-Prieto are just like any other Chinese-Filipino tycoons notorious for being tax evaders.President Arroyos Solicitor General Agnes Devanadera in 2009 revealed that the elite family owed Php 1.8 billion for Sunvar. This was based on the Php 630 million the family owes from illegal and unauthorized use of the property from 2003 to March 21, 2009 and the Php 10.4 million monthly rent from April 2008 until it was given over to the government.Rufino-Prieto dismissed their debts after maneuvering through several court cases and continued to charge rentals from over 400 stores for 14 years after its lease expired in 2002.The Sunvar debt is a measly rent of P360 per square meter per month government is asking Sunvar to paya give-away price in a prime area where rents are at least P50,000 per sq. m. per month.Supreme Court (SC) issued a decision on 2012 that urged the elite family to pay ASAP the debts that they owe to the State.In the SCs court ruling, it said:The Court notes that respondent Sunvar has continued to occupy the subject property since the expiration of its sublease on 31 December 2002. The factual issue of whether respondent has paid rentals to petitioners from the expiration of the sublease to the present was never raised or sufficiently argued before this Court. Nevertheless, it has not escaped the Courts attention that almost a decade has passed without any resolution of this controversy regarding respondents possession of the subject property.Despite the intervention of the SC, the lower court took three years to issue a decision. Metropolitan Trial Court Judge Barbara Aleli Briones in July 2015 ordered Sunvar to pay only P555 million, a mere 30% of what they owe.It was until the case reached Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 141 Maryann Corpus-Manalac and MRTC Branch 59 Judge Winlove Dumayas that the Rufino-Prieto family had their way and was granted control of the property.Tiglao pointed out that when the Mile Long property was being guarded over by former President Macapagal-Arroyo, their news arm, Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) demonized Arroyo and continuously publicized alleged corruption scandals.However, when former President Benigno Aquino III took seat and suspended the case on the questionable lease of their properties, PDI unabashedly idolized and supported his administration.President Rodrigo Duterte swore to look into these property deals of the Rufino-Prieto firm as he also lambasts their news arm for criticizing and demonizing his administration when the elite family owes up to billion to the Flipinos.Tiglao challenges the status quo and questioned, what would the hundreds of thousands of urban poor squatters in the metropolis say when riot police try to eject them? Why us poor, not the rich squatting on prime government land?",Public Trending
0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,8,0,2358477,0,0," Can she promise the nation that the audit of Aquinos pork barrel will be finished this year, and not after the 2016 elections?Would Tan stonewall the audit of Aquinos pork barrel as a quid pro quo for her to be appointed soon as a Supreme Court justice? We hope not.COA must immediately audit Aquinos pork because it involves a much larger amount of P220 billion, which is eight times the P26 billion pork for 2007-2009.More importantly, Aquino had blatantly used the PDAF and the DAP especially in 2011 and 2012 to bribe first members of the House in filing an impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Renato Corona, and then the senators to convict him.This has been established not only by testimony of those receiving the funds (it was Jinggoy Estrada who exposed it in October 2013), but also by the timing of the funds releases. (See my columns: P559 million released before Senate vote vs. Corona, Sept. 29, 2013 and DBM data confirms P100M bribe to 16 senators each, Oct 3. 2013.)Another P4 billion was disbursed to congressmen in 2012, at P15 million each, for having filed the impeachment case against Corona.Think about it. With Aquino bribing congressmen and senators by throwing at them millions of pesos worth of pork barrel funds, would he or his officials have tightened up procedures to make sure that the legislators dont steal the proceeds, as they had done in 2007-2009?Or, as rumors have circulated, was it Napoles herself and another still unidentified mastermind of the pork barrel scam who helped the legislators, with Aquinos endorsement, to steal from the pork barrel bribe the president gave them so theyd remove Corona?Was Napoles participation in the pork barrel bribes in 2011-2012 the reason for her inexplicable confidence that she would survive her current nightmare, for Aquino to personally see her in Malacaang when she surrendered in August and accompany her to the police headquarters?Or was it an Abad-Napoles tandem in this bigger pork-barrel scam under Aquino? Note that Abad was a congressman for nine years, from 1995 to 2004, who religiously collected his pork barrel that was used for his 16,000 constituents in his tiny province of Batanes.SponsorEspecially since the COA had asked him for documents for its 2007-2009 audit, it is impossible that Abad did not know how peoples money was being stolen through the pork barrel system.Did he advise Aquino that this is the easiest way to bribe Congress so it would remove Corona, and recommended Napoles to help out? Was it this that Napoles was really referring to when she wrote in her sworn statement that it was Abad who taught her how to use NGOs for the pork barrel scam?For all of Aquinos sickening blah-blahs about walang mahirap kung walang corrupt, did he ever talk against the pork barrel system before it was exposed in 2013?Since he, and he alone, directed the use of the DAP, Aquino used these funds as his own personal treasury. Undeniably, Aquinos hands are tainted with pork barrel money.Note also COAs wrong priorities to support Aquinos fake anti-graft campaign.In another move to persecute former President Arroyo as well as to pin down Napoles and the three senators, the COA undertook a special audit of P900 million of the Malampaya funds coursed in 1999 through the agrarian reform department starting in 2011.But what may be compared to the Agrarian reform departments Malampaya scam is the P8.6 billionten times the Malampaya moneyAquino gave to the ARMM from the DAP funds, purportedly to accelerate the regions development.And how were these distributed? Through Aquinos hand-picked ARRM Governor Mujiv Hataman who even had a media-covered ceremony distributing P10 million in checks to officials of the region in January 2013. Aquino even complained at that event that Hataman wasnt disbursing the funds quick enough!For all its posturing as an anti-corruption body, the COA under Tan will be judged by history as another institution prostituted by Aquino, unless she orders the audit of this presidents P220 billion pork barrel, the biggest amount of government money ever put under a presidents sole whim in our history, and the biggest secret of all in this saga.",Public Trending

Although himself anti-Duterte, Paredes said back then that there is injustice if you dont do justice anyway. There is injustice in not catching crooks. So, err on the side of zealousness. I would have gone that way, anyway, and when he was asked if that means lining up the crooks against a wall and shooting them, he replies, Oh, that would be nice, too. You know what? I wouldnt cry over it if it happened.His dismay at the Aquino government stemmed from the fact that it squandered the leadership that the Filipinos gave to them after EDSA. The reforms and changes that the people wanted actualized were held at bay and corruption, debts, and various coup attempts emerged.I dont think they were as bold as the people wanted them to bemasyadong nagpapogi, masyadong nagpa-pressure, Paredes said they should have run to the people. But [they didnt because] what happens is that when you sit in government, the people dont count anymore. Its the other forces that count  the armed forces, the politicians, the moneyed, business. The people dont count. They should have run to the people and the people would have protected them.It is clear that Paredes wanted a revolution for the Philippines back in his 2006 interview. When asked about his opinion on the possible repercussions that a strong government would have on the peoples freedoms, Paredes boldly commented that there is no such thing as absolute artistic freedom, any freedom. Freedom is relative. I would be willing to be more responsible about itbut I will not give it up. If it is the governments duty to curb (artistic freedom), then let them curb it but I will not give it up.Paredes felt in the era of a post-Marcos regime that the only way for liberal democracy to work is with a strong leader reasoning that kung malakas-lakas yung leader mo, who can sort of  I mean, to pardon the expression  can sort of kick ass, no, matatakot ka to tangle with a strong President eh, kahit Senate President ka pa.He even said that if a strong leader who embodies those qualities would emerge, he would be willing to give that leader a chance, however all his conclusive statements about a revolution in 2006 wavers in the face of issues bombarding him now.He lambasted Pro-Duterte supporters and decries the President for the so-called authoritarian rule despite being ready to support this style of government more than a decade ago.As Correctphilippines.org said about Paredes change of heart, something went wrong with him along the way and somehow the Yellows got him.",Public Trending

They need our helpover and beyond what most of us need.And I hear that on top of these homes, transportation to and from school for the children will be provided for. And then of course, theres the rice subsidy on top of the conditional cash transfer they will get. And I hear public school kids are going to be given carabao milk every day.

Alam ninyong taga-Davao. You know, all Davaoeos know that. They were picking victims right in the middle of the downtown area. Sa [uyangco?] rin dinampot nila yung babae kasama yung boyfriend. They were just into thisthere used to be a Betamax, you have to go to an outlet and rent one. They just picked up the woman and brought her to Cotabato and they detained her for 2 months. One day, they sent feelers of to the family and shes still alive. She is now a doctor, the womansent feelers to the parents that they were going to surrender or return the hostage, I dont want to mention the name. Sabi nila in exchange for 2 million not to tell the police but the parents whispered to me.So, on that fateful night, they were travelling. I was there with retired police Elson Estares and two others because they never expected that they would pass this way but they would return. It is not done. Usually if you pass in this area, you pass only once. You do not go back andbut the troops were there surrounding the house. So when we heard somebody inside, hes a brave guy, Lima, he was the one I told. You go there because he was a shooter. I said could you take out three persons at one time, he said yes.When the firefight started and Duterte already knew that the criminals were ready to kill and to die, he grabbed his m16 to finish them off.Okay you will be that inside the bedroom. And when she said the birdie, birdie is safe. So they went down and it was covered by the televisions. The networks were just at the background. So, when they refused to stop, we saw a carbine pointed at us. We were parked nearby. So, the shooting started and I was one holding aI was holding a .45 but you know, when I saw them coming back to our direction, I grabbed my M16, American-made, mind youto kill criminals. Not extrajudicial, there was a firefight. And I said there were about only three of us there.He lambasted the people who criticized him for his admission that he killed criminals and told them that hes only doing his job to protect the people of Davao.So, I might have hit them all or none at all. But the fact is I was there and I fired at them. It was a pure case of kidnapping. It happened during my first term in 1988. And here comes an idiotalways an idiot almost all of them are, saying that my admission, that I shot the suspect, they were not suspect. You idiotic. I dont know from where you are. To us I was not a suspect, I was in a shootout and many others in my career of the 23 years. I am a mayor that cannot tolerate oppression of civilians, and many others and small encounters. Another kidnap-killing I was there. It also resulted in a shootout. The family was athe wife of a small mall here in the city. So whats wrong in being, you are pictured to be a killer.So, at least I killed to protect people. I am not here a dictator killing my political opponents to stay in power.Duterte said that he only kill to protect the oppressed people of his city where criminality where rampant during the 1980s before he became a Mayor.",Public Trending

Leila de Lima collected 1 billions from high-profile inmates in New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City when she was still justice secretary in the previous administration.This was the common allegation raised by several inmates in their affidavits submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Drug and robbery convict Herbert Colangco revealed that the Carcel Side, a coalition of gangs of inmates from the Visayas and Mindanao which he leads, had given De Lima P3 million per month.Carcel is one of the two factions of inmates in the national penitentiary with over 7,000 members belonging to the Oxo Allied Group. The other is the Presidio Side led by drug convict Jaybee Sebastian with over 5,000 inmates, mostly from Luzon.In a four-page affidavit obtained by The STAR, Colangco explained that the amount was for payola to then DOJ secretary De Lima para sa pribilehiyo sa amin at para maipagpatuloy din ang mga negosyo sa Bilibid (for privileges accorded to us and also for our businesses inside the NBP to continue).Sa tantiya ko po, ang umiikot na halaga ng droga sa loob ng Bilibid sa pagpayag ni secretary De Lima bago pa kami ilipat sa NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) ay hindi bababa sa limampung milyong piso kada buwan (By my estimate, the amount of illegal drug trade inside the NBP upon permission of secretary De Lima before we were transferred to NBI would not be lower than P50 million per month), bared the self-styled musician who even managed to produce music videos inside the penitentiary.Apart from illegal drug trade, Colangco confessed that he also ventured into selling beer inside the NBP during De Limas time. He said he was allowed to sell beer in can to thousands of inmates during events at NBP for more than 10 times the original price per can and would earn P3 million for 300 boxes.Ang share ni secretary De Lima sa pag-aapruba sa pagpasok nito ay P1 million. Ito po ay dinadala ng tao kong si Rey sa DOJ o kinukuha ng tao ni secretary De Lima na si Joenel Sanchez (kasama sa security ni De Lima) at ng kanyang boyfriend na si Ronnie Dayan (secretary De Limas share for approving the entry of beer was P1 million.It was either delivered by my courier Rey to DOJ or picked up by secretary De Limas security aide Joenel Sanchez and her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan), Colangco further alleged in his notarized affidavit.Colangco, head of the notorious Ozamiz robbery gang, recalled that when he and other high-profile inmates were transferred to the NBI in 2014, Sebastian then had a monopoly of illegal drug trade and other illicit activities inside the NBP.Ang hindi susunod sa kanyang gusto ay tinatakot na ipapatapon. Naniniwala ang mga tao sa loob ng Bilibid na pwedeng gawin ito sa kanila ni Jaybee Sebastian dahil alam nila ito ay malapit kay secretary De Lima lalo na sa boyfriend nito na si Ronnie Dayan (Those who will defy him were warned to be thrown away.People in the NBP believe that he is capable of doing that because he is known to be close with secretary De Lima, especially with her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan), he added in the sworn statement signed last Sept. 1. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has confirmed that Colangco, fellow drug convict Noel Martinez and about 10 other inmates would testify before the House of Representatives inquiry on the proliferation of illegal drugs in the NBP. He revealed that eight of them have been transferred to the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) custody for fear of their lives inside the national penitentiary in Muntinlupa City. Aguirre said some of the witnesses have bared in separate affidavits that they have collected money from illegal drugs since 2013 to support the senatorial bid of then secretary De Lima.The DOJ chief hinted that there is also a witness who delivered P5 million to De Limas house in Paraaque City, which was allegedly personally received by the senator and Dayan. Aguirre added that they also received information that De Lima, wearing a disguise, visited the NBP eight times and would go directly to the kubol of Sebastian.He said a letter from Sebastian would be submitted to the House on this matter. Aguirre earlier alleged that secretary De Lima brought out coached witness Edgar Matobato, who claimed to be a former member of the Davao death squad, in a desperate move to preempt the explosive testimonies and evidence to be presented against her in the House probe that will start on Tuesday.",Public Trending

If its true I can understand the Danish,governments uneasiness. All of this supposedly,occurred over a period of 6 months,during the initial breech. Although it happened from about,February to August in 2012 it still brings to light a few,interesting thoughts.According to Wargs defense,team the hacks were definitely carried out on a computer that was OWNED by Warg. This same computer,was accessed by a number of different developers in Wargs group and any one of them could have been the,responsible party. This seems to mirror the idea that, if you lend,someone your car and they accidentally kill a person with it, YOU are responsible. Its definitely an arguable point.The big, ugly, greasy,monkey wrench in that whole theory is Mr. Wargs own record and reputation since getting,accused of this invasion. He was initially arrested in his apartment in Cambodia In September of 2012 but, before Denmark could,extradite him, He was deported to Sweden to serve jail time for copyright theft because of being,involved with TPB (The Pirate Bay). While in Sweden he was tried yet again for hacking into a banks computers. He was finally taken to Denmark in November of 2013 and sat there for a bit. So, it took two years before he went to trial in Denmark for the CSC breeches. I wonder how much,disappeared in that time? Subsequently, Mr. Warg was sentenced to 3.5 years jail time as opposed to the,maximum of 6 years for this type of infraction to the law.This little piggy,would like to know if Mr. Warg was convicted by being associated with other hacking crimes or because he physically did it? Considering,there was no evidence found by the computer forensics officials pointing,directly to him as the actual culprit. Why was he convicted and his 21 year old partner (whose name was,withheld to protect his privacy*cough cough*) walked off with time served? Was Mr. Warg portrayed as a horrible,man that attacked governments to a jury that really didnt understand anything about technology? Was he a cyber-terrorist in the making?

He wishes to remain anonymous as these impressions and statements,could be harmful when traced back to him. This is the essence and I did paraphrase,his words so some of it may seem out of context.The good people of China are,among the most indoctrinated Ive ever seen, nothing about the way they defend their government seems somewhat,genuine. It looks like they are wired to have a sense of hatred toward the Tibetan people. They are continuously,lied to by the government at every opportunity they get and they are censored,themselves on Sina Weibo, the government-controlled social network. I got arrested when,interviewing a local police officer who felt my behaviour was unethical and downright evil. When in custody , I had the chance to talk to inmates,who had been through roughly the same thing. In our cell block, there,were no murderers to be found, no rapists nor psychopaths. We were all just asking the wrong,questions at the wrong time and place. The stories I heard were those of Tibetans,getting captured for vague reasons and released after two months and all of these prisoners were found dead 1 year later and no one could,link those deaths to the Chinese anymore due to the leap in time. I was struck with fear and,hatred toward the Chinese people who just keep on living their lives and who dont question,the authorities. This censorship is of course a violation of the human rights and organisations,such as amnesty are trying their best to fight this. It almost seems ridiculous how openly they abuse,freedom rights for example Liu Xiaobo Who won the nobel prize for peace (because of his work on fighting,the government) whilst in captivity, oh the irony .GreatFire is a secretive organisation,that monitors the censored,messages on Sina Weibo and posts them on freeweibo.com for the world to see. The activists,think that the way they made the app renders it impossible to be blocked by the,government. They hope that will show others an effective way to avoid Chinese internet,restrictions, whilst furthering their goal of ending online censorship in China. GreatFire was founded in 2011 by three guys who wish to remain,anonymous in fear of Chinas revenge. So how did they bypass the internet,restrictions? They hosted FreeWeibo on amazons cloud hosting service, It cannot be blocked,because of the businesses that rely on amazon . If blocked , too many businesses,would suffer from economic losses and the Chinese government cant have that. This gives Greatfire an epic advantage,almost like a bank heist with an enormous amount of hostages being held. The mobile app was,taken down from the app store in reply .GreatFire hopes that the android,version cannot be taken down (as easily) and furthermore that amazon doesnt make any deals with China (so far they have,kept quiet and respected their customers privacy when,asked about FreeWeibo). Their plans for the future include mirroring Free news sites such as The New York Times. This will prove to be a far bigger,challenge because this site get updated,frequently and is quite huge as well. Our goal is to end online censorship,in China. Thats the endgame for us, says one of the founders of GreatFire.

According to the HTTP standard, error code 402 was reserved for future use and was labeled Payment Required.Just as we needed a way to freely share information, we needed a way to freely exchange value. Implementing a standardized payment protocol was a natural fit. But while data can live in a world where its easily reproduced, value inherently exists as the result of scarcity  in other words, the antithesis of the copy-and-paste nature of the information web.It quickly became evident that overcoming this challenge was no easy feat, and the idea was shelved indefinitely. While information could be exchanged in a decentralized fashion, there was no way to transfer value online without a central operator.That all changed in 2009 with the arrival of bitcoin, a medley of cryptography and peer-to-peer technology that elegantly solved this problem. From that vantage point, payment protocols like Bitcoin and Ripple  which allow us to transfer value online with each other directly  represent the continuation of the unfinished business of the webs original founders.Consequently, there are numerous parallels between the birth of the information web and the developments were seeing now.Its easy to take the Internet as it currently exists for granted. Its evolution from an esoteric network for researchers and hobbyists to todays all-encompassing mainstream phenomenon was a long and arduous journey. It started with a classic chicken-and-egg problem: The Internet needed developers to build utility on it to attract users, but developers first needed users for whom to build.The early Internet was bootstrapped by academia and the military. Though the network was already open, global in scope, and quite powerful, there was little consumer utility. Instead, mainstream consumers used proprietary network solutions that were in vogue at the time. The likes of AOL (owner of TechCrunch) and CompuServe provided value-added services, from news to messaging to games.The only problem was that these pre-Internet networks didnt interoperate. If you were on GEnie, there wasnt a straightforward way to interact with your friends on AOL in the 80s. Thats not so different from how our payment networks currently operate, where systems like PayPal, Alipay and M-PESA arent yet federated.Two key developments unfolded in 1989: Tim Berners-Lee conceived the idea of the World Wide Web, and CompuServe became one of the first major online services to provide an email gateway, allowing its users to communicate via the Internet. These events marked the beginning of the federation phase of the Internets evolution. In both cases, standardized protocols allowed users to share information or communicate with each other directly, no matter what service, software, or hardware they used.",Public Trending
