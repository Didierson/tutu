"Ruffa Gutierrez allegedly scandalized the staff of St. Luke’s Medical Arts Building.The actress was said to have underwent a knee procedure after her intense workout.What happened and how did the actress supposedly reacted on the procedure? Read on!Ruffa Gutierrez is known for being gregarious and completely open. Recently, it was alleged that she scandalized the staff of St. Luke’s Medical Arts Building located in the Bonifacio Global City because of her supposed shrieks.According to an unverified report by Abante TNT, the actress supposedly shrieked because of a knee procedure done to her by a certain Dr. Vista.The source claimed that she said through social media:“Doctor removed 2 jars of liquid from my knee!!! It was the most painful thing on earth!!! The entire hospital heard my scream, ‘kaloka! I cried so much. I need to rest for the next 2 days and no workout”They cited that she said those words in an exchange of chat messages with her. However, it is worth noting that the chat may or may not have happened since the report remains unverified as of this writing.Ruffa Gutierrez allegedly injured her knee from a workout she had three months ago. The actress was quoted as saying:“I went to 2 other doctors who said I just needed therapy, pero palagi pa ring masakit my knee, so, I went to Dad’s (Eddie Gutierrez) doctor at St. Luke’s Global today. My gosh, he got soooooo much fluid from my knee. It was so swollen. I need to rest, but not totally bed rest naman.”According to the source, she needed to place an ice pack and an ointment on her knee so that it wouldn’t become “black” or “blue” in appearance.She reportedly claimed, “Kaloka talaga. But the good news is I’ve already lost 7 kilos. Yeheeey! Thanks to my diet, may trainer Arnold.”They added that the actress supposedly gets affected whenever her mother Annabelle Rama would mention that she needed to workout since she is “fat.” As such, she would go on “diets” and “workouts.”Watch the video below:What do you think about Ruffa Gutierrez supposedly involving the staff of St. Luke’s in BGC in a scandal?

"It’s up to you to figure out what “coming out” in today’s headline means. Those words came from Funfare’s VDPA (Very Deep Penetration Agent) who said that early next year, Mark Bautista is “coming out” with a tell-all book that can send shock waves through the industry.“Mark will leave nothing to the imagination,” swore the VDPA close to Mark, who claimed to have seen the rough draft of the book stamped “highly confidential” at the moment and once it is out in the market, “it is bound to cause a lot of people sleepless nights.”When word leaked that Mark was “coming out” with a “no-holds-barred” book, some people (this one included) dismissed it as, well, a false alarm, until Funfare’s VDPA said that it’s true.“If you have read the auto-biographies of Cliff Richard, Ricky Martin, Olympic American diver Greg Louganis and other celebrities ‘coming out’ of their shells,” added the VDPA, “you will have an idea what Mark’s book is all about.”Anyway, let’s wait and see until the book’s launch.The big question is: Will Mark name names and invite whoever are “revealed” in the book to its launch? Will somebody stop its publication? Will anybody file a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) against its release?Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1“One thing is sure,” continued the VDPA. “Something profound happened to Mark during his prolonged stay abroad, starting in London where he played Ferdinand Marcos in the musical Here Lies Love.”Kuya E (Neo de Padua) returns with a concert on Dec. 14 at the Music MuseumHow the Big C changed Kuya E’s outlook in lifeThere’s a reason why Kuya E (Neo de Padua) titled his concert Miracle, Music & Love, slated for Dec. 14 (Thursday), 7 p.m. at the Music Museum.You see, Kuya E was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer in 2006 and he went into remission two years later. He has been cancer-free since then.“It’s a miracle that I am still alive,” confessed Kuya E, “and every morning when I wake up, the first thing I do is thank God for giving me another day. Life is like music; sometimes it’s happy, sometimes it’s sad. It’s up to you to choose the melody of your life. I love inspiring and promoting love in all walks of life.”Produced by Big Eyes Events & Productions, the concert marks the comeback of Kuya E after a long absence. He used to be known as “The Millionaire Maker of MLM Industry in the Philippines,” until he was taken ill. Among his guest performers are the E4 Band, Ani Pearl, Kath Loria, Rapido and 2017 Himig Handog awardee Aikee.“My outlook in life has changed,” said Kuya E. “I don’t get angry easily, I am more forgiving and more prayerful. I start and end my day by praying. I also make it a point to say ‘I love you’ to my loved ones while they are still around to appreciate it. And I have forgiven those who cheated me of millions.”Aside from the concert, Kuya E is almost finished recording an album supervised by Vehnee Saturno, with Ako’y Nangarap as carrier single. In January next year, he will host the show RYTS (Rule Yourself To Success) on NET 25.(For tickets to Miracle, Music and Love, call 0921-3253118 or 0956-6834843.)Jet Rai with his two ‘diptych’ works, The Muse and Mantis Head, at the Artchemy: Mixing Modern With Contemporary exhibit at the Art Anton Gallery in MOA Complex, Pasay City, from Dec. 2 to 24.Jet Rai in Artchemy: Mixing Modern with Contemporary exhibitGone from the showbiz/modeling scene for a while, Jet Rai has been busy painting preparatory to the Artchemy: Mixing Modern with Contemporary exhibit which runs from Dec. 2 to 24 at the Art Anton Gallery (Ground Floor, S Maison, Marina Way, Mall of Asia Complex, Pasay City).The show features legendary artists Joe Datuin, Fil Delacruz, Raul G.

It is an alchemy of the modern and the contemporary.(E-mail reactions at entphilstar@yahoo.com.

"FILE – Nonito Donaire, left, and Guillermo Rigondeaux face off ahead of their super bantamweight title fight. APA five-division champion, Nonito Donaire knows a thing or two about fighting, so when he saw Guillermo Rigondeux quit mid-fight against Vasyl Lomachenko, that decision did not quite sit well with him.“Incredible performance from Loma, Rigo has never been in this position where he has been dominated every way,” Donaire posted on Twitter Sunday. “But I still can’t understand how a fighter quits.”“I fought with bloody hands, I fought with numerous fractures, and sometimes my brain tells me to stop and tells me I’ve done enough but never in my life have I ever quit.”Rigondeux, a natural super bantamweight, moved two weight classes to challenge Lomachenko for the WBO world super featherweight belt and failed after he quit on his stool before the seventh round.READ: Lomachenko stops Rigondeaux in bout between Olympic greats“You could knock me down and I’ll at least attempt to get up,” said Donaire (38-4). “But I won’t quit ever, it is what it is.”Donaire added that he wasn’t bitter losing to Rigendeaux and that he even wanted to see his former opponent to win especially after moving up a couple of weight classes.READ: Donaire yields world boxing title to Rigondeaux“The Filipino Flash” lost to Rigondeaux in 2013 via unanimous decision in their unification bout for the WBA and WBO world super bantamweight titles.Donaire, the current WBC silver featherweight champion even mentioned that he also wanted Nicholas Walters, whom he lost to in 2014, to win against Lomachenko back in 2016.READ: Unbeaten Walters KOs Donaire for title“Some people believe I’m sour or bitter and wanted Rigo to lose, on the contrary, I wanted Walters and Rigo to win because in doing so it gives me the credibility of getting beaten by the top pound-for-pound,” said Donaire.“Staying on the stool with half the fight left, on the other hand, negates the macho image purported by going two weight divisions up.”",Donaire blasts Rigondeaux for quitting vs Lomachenko  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"The bitcoin frenzy shows no sign of letting up, with the price of the digital currency soaring and bitcoin futures set to start trading on Sunday. Here’s a look at what bitcoin is and why there’s so much excitement around it.So what is bitcoin?It’s a fairly new type of currency, not controlled by any government or centrally processed by any bank or company. You can use it to buy things, though don’t expect your corner store to necessarily take it, and increasingly it’s used as an investment.You could think of it as a sort of gold for the digital era. Like gold, no one centrally controls production, supply is limited in part by the effort required to produce it, and you can hold on to it as a store of value.But because it’s digital it can be sent anywhere easily, and each bitcoin can be divided up into fractions much easier than trying to cut up a gold bar, making it potentially much easier to use for actual transactions and to act like a currency.How does it work?The biggest challenge to a digital currency is what’s called double-spending.Without a bank or credit card or other intermediary acting as a trusted third party, confirming that the same number of dollars come out of one person’s account and go into another, it’s hard to make sure people aren’t spending the same digital money in multiple places or multiple times.Bitcoin solves this with a public digital ledger that records every transaction, and which forms the basis of the blockchain. Specialized computers around the world crunch complex mathematical problems that incorporate information from a transaction, then once solved, other computers verify the math. The solved equation, with the transaction incorporated, is then added to the blockchain as a permanent record.The combination of collective confirmation, and the public record of the transaction, combine to solve the lack of centralized clearing.How are bitcoin made?Dan Ingram sets up some of his new bitcoin mining machines in a warehouse he’s renting in B.C.’s Lower Mainland. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC)New bitcoin is produced as the reward for trying to solve the complex equations involved in every transaction.Specialized computer farms are set up to solve the equations, with the first network to actually solve the equation rewarded with new bitcoin. While in the early days after bitcoin was launched in 2009 this could be done by hobbyists from personal computers, the increased complexity of the blockchain means it requires more energy and computing power to solve the equations and produce new coins.The energy being used to power the network is enormous. Bitcoin-focused website Digiconomist calculates that bitcoin uses more than 32 terawatt hours of power a year, or about the same power as Denmark uses in a year. Digiconomist says that with much of the network powered by cheap coal electricity in China, each transaction has a footprint of about 122 kilograms of carbon.How and why would you use it?People can buy bitcoin, but the price of the cryptocurrency has been rising, quickly. (Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images)Bitcoin is touted as a way to make free and secure money transfers, potentially cutting out the fees charged by companies that have traditionally processed those transactions. The digital currency could allow people in countries with heavily manipulated or controlled currencies to make international transactions easier, or it could be used as a more novel way to send money to friends. The price volatility, however, has made using it as a currency trickier.As to actually using bitcoin, while no one centrally controls it, you still need the software or app and an exchange to make the transaction easier. Then all you need to do is give up some of your government-backed currency for bitcoins and you’re in the game.Why is the value increasing so much? Is it a bubble?When it launched in 2009, each bitcoin was worth very little, since the system was designed to make it easy at first to make more bitcoin on a simple laptop, allowing the supply to grow. Even as recently as early 2013 it was trading for under $15 US, but since the start of 2017 the price has gone from about $1,000 to its recent highs in five figure territory.The growth is being cause by a few factors, including wider use of the underlying blockchain and the spread of alternative forms of bitcoin, more security on the exchange networks and more companies launching with plans to use bitcoin. Once its value started to rise, it’s now a self-feeding frenzy with investors from around the world able to buy into it with few barriers to entry.With bitcoin not paying any dividends, interest or other rewards for holding it, people buying into the currency as an investment hope it’s value will simply keep rising. As to how high it will go, or how much it will fall when interest wanes is anyone’s guess.",What is bitcoin and why is the digital currency surging?  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"A patient being carried out of an ambulance was accidentally dropped to the ground by hospital staff. The incident was caught on the CCTV of a hospital in Surigao del Norte.Apparently, the safety belt on the stretcher the patient was being carried on was not properly strapped in and that the wheel of the stretcher were locked which caused the patient's body to tilt to the side and completely fell to the ground.The patient was declared dead on arrival but his wife speculates that the mishandling of the hospital staff that caused his husband to fall might have had greatly contributed to her husband's death. She also said that she could still hear him snoring on the way to the hospital and firmly believes that if he hadn't fall from the stretcher, he may still be alive right now. On the other hand, the doctor who attended the patient said he was already dead because of heart attack.The hospital also pointed out that the family of the patient breached the emergency protocol by bringing another person board the ambulance instead of having just the wife to go with the patient. That other person, who happens to be a nurse, was said to have tried to interfere with the staff by kicking the stretcher wheel that won't unlock.The patient's cousin said in defense that rescuers specifically asked for her help.""Yung rescuer humingi ng tulong na sipain 'yung gulong kasi hindi nila maiangat yung lock ng gulong ng stretcher. Yung stretcher din kasi nila may depekto."", the patient's cousin said.The hospital also suggests that the family edited the CCTV video and that they are just using their predicament for monetary gains.Meanwhile, the Surigao City Emergency Rescue Services remains mum on the issue.Watch the video report of the incident below:Here's the full copy of the CCTV footage posted by the victim's relative on social media:",Hospital Staff Dropped Heart Attack Patient From Stretcher

"• Can she promise the nation that the audit of Aquino’s pork barrel will be finished this year, and not after the 2016 elections?Would Tan stonewall the audit of Aquino’s pork barrel as a quid pro quo for her to be appointed soon as a Supreme Court justice? We hope not.COA must immediately audit Aquino’s pork because it involves a much larger amount of P220 billion, which is eight times the P26 billion pork for 2007-2009.More importantly, Aquino had blatantly used the PDAF and the DAP especially in 2011 and 2012 to bribe first members of the House in filing an impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Renato Corona, and then the senators to convict him.This has been established not only by testimony of those receiving the funds (it was Jinggoy Estrada who exposed it in October 2013), but also by the timing of the funds’ releases. (See my columns: “P559 million released before Senate vote vs. Corona”, Sept. 29, 2013 and “DBM data confirms P100M ‘bribe’ to 16 senators each,” Oct 3. 2013.)Another P4 billion was disbursed to congressmen in 2012, at P15 million each, for having filed the impeachment case against Corona.Think about it. With Aquino bribing congressmen and senators by throwing at them millions of pesos worth of pork barrel funds, would he or his officials have tightened up procedures to make sure that the legislators don’t steal the proceeds, as they had done in 2007-2009?Or, as rumors have circulated, was it Napoles herself and another still unidentified mastermind of the pork barrel scam who helped the legislators, with Aquino’s endorsement, to steal from the pork barrel bribe the president gave them so they’d remove Corona?Was Napoles’ participation in the pork barrel bribes in 2011-2012 the reason for her inexplicable confidence that she would survive her current nightmare, for Aquino to personally see her in Malacañang when she surrendered in August and accompany her to the police headquarters?Or was it an Abad-Napoles tandem in this bigger pork-barrel scam under Aquino? Note that Abad was a congressman for nine years, from 1995 to 2004, who religiously collected his pork barrel that was used for his 16,000 constituents in his tiny province of Batanes.SponsorEspecially since the COA had asked him for documents for its 2007-2009 audit, it is impossible that Abad did not know how people’s money was being stolen through the pork barrel system.Did he advise Aquino that this is the easiest way to bribe Congress so it would remove Corona, and recommended Napoles to help out? Was it this that Napoles was really referring to when she wrote in her sworn statement that it was Abad who taught her how to use NGOs for the pork barrel scam?For all of Aquino’s sickening blah-blahs about “walang mahirap kung walang corrupt,” did he ever talk against the pork barrel system before it was exposed in 2013?Since he, and he alone, directed the use of the DAP, Aquino used these funds as his own personal treasury. Undeniably, Aquino’s hands are tainted with pork barrel money.Note also COA’s wrong priorities to support Aquino’s fake anti-graft campaign.In another move to persecute former President Arroyo as well as to pin down Napoles and the three senators, the COA undertook a special audit of P900 million of the Malampaya funds coursed in 1999 through the agrarian reform department starting in 2011.But what may be compared to the Agrarian reform department’s Malampaya scam is the P8.6 billion—ten times the Malampaya money—Aquino gave to the ARMM from the DAP funds, purportedly to accelerate the region’s development.And how were these distributed? Through Aquino’s hand-picked ARRM Governor Mujiv Hataman who even had a media-covered ceremony distributing P10 million in checks to officials of the region in January 2013. Aquino even complained at that event that Hataman wasn’t disbursing the funds quick enough!For all its posturing as an anti-corruption body, the COA under Tan will be judged by history as another institution prostituted by Aquino, unless she orders the audit of this president’s P220 billion pork barrel, the biggest amount of government money ever put under a president’s sole whim in our history, and the biggest secret of all in this saga.",Public Trending

"From judges and lawmakers to mayors and local-government bosses to military personnel and police officers, the tangled web of the Philippines’ illegal-drugs networks is being dragged into the light. And the long-held open secret that national and local ranking officials are involved and directly profiting from the drugs trade has been laid bare with President Rodrigo Duterte’s naming and shaming 160 of them.Reading out a list of names at a military base in Davao, Duterte declared that they had all been sacked and that their gun permits and all official protection for them were being withdrawn. They should, he said, hand themselves in to authorities or he will instruct the Philippine army and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to “hunt you down”.The significance of this is that the war is now being waged further up the food chain. The shift from the street war against drug peddlers to the owners and operators of the drug cartels which are backed by powerful regional politicians, shows a clear expansion of Duterte’s strategy and underscores his commitment to rid his country of drugs.One of those on the list was Ronaldo Espinosa, mayor of Albuera, a town in Leyte, Eastern Visayas. He surrendered to authorities the day before a raid by police commandos on his home which left six of his bodyguards dead. Thirteen high-powered firearms and five pistols were seized at the scene. Espinosa is believed to have a small army of 50-100 well-armed protectors.His son, Kerwin, now on the run, is described by police as armed and dangerous and the region’s “No. 1 drug lord”. PNP Director General Ronald Dela Rosa warned him: ‘Your father already surrendered so you should follow your father… Your life is really in danger.’Espinosa Snr denies any involvement in the drugs trade and says his son was no more than a pusher of shabu, a methamphetamine. The police say that their family narcotic business is extensive and are now dismantling it.In other developments, Johaira Macabut (alias Abinal) – known as the “Mindanao Drug Queen” – a former mayor of Maguing, a town in Lanao del Sur, in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has been arrested at her home in Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental. The raid, by officers of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, uncovered a quantity of shabu and a number of guns. Five other mayors, three from ARMM and one each from Bulucan and Iloilo, have also handed themselves in to police. Others are being tracked down as a “shoot on sight” order remains in place.With an estimated 3% of the country’s 1.2 million population addicted to drugs and 92% of Metro Manila’s barangays afflicted by narcotics, the administration is fighting a war and a pandemic.

"Arthur Tugade, the incoming Transport Department secretary, might just have the solution for Manila’s nightmare and daymare commuting problems. Take the passenger traffic off the roads – and put them in the air.Cable cars, gondolas, pods – or to give them their proper name, cable-propelled transport (CPT) – Tugade believes, could be the most efficient way of relieving the traffic congestion which has now all but choked the capital. Vehicle density in Manila is 3,677 per square meter – to give you an idea: New York City is 2,504, Singapore is 1,360 and Tokyo is 967.It is a bold plan and one that is worthy of the man who was able to rid the Clark Development Corporation of its sluggish, corruption-laden culture and poor financial returns and transform it into a vibrant operation with good governance and impressive profits.Right now, the idea is still in its infancy – though Tugade has mentioned Metro Manila’s Pasig City area as one possible location and a cable link between Makati and Santa Rosa in Laguna as another. Logistics surveys, viability studies and cost estimates have yet to be carried out, but given the success of urban CPT systems elsewhere in the world, Manila looks ripe for one of its own.Lagos in Nigeria, for example, is planning to have its own CPT. That city has 21 million citizens and practically no fixed transport infrastructure. Metro Manila has around 13 million citizens and a transport infrastructure which is now unfit for purpose.Tugade’s cable cars will each have a 35-passenger capacity – that’s a small coach load – while jeepneys, the most common mode of mass transport on Manila’s roads, have an official seating capacity of 20. Do the math: 20 pods = 700 passengers = 35 jeepneys. For cars, taking 4 passengers per vehicle, its even more impressive > 20 pods = 700 passengers = 175 cars. The 10.7km CPT system in the Bolivian capital, La Paz – admittedly, the biggest in the world – can handle 9,000 passengers an hour; 3,000 on each of its three cable routes.CPT systems are spring up all over the world – from Germany to Algeria, Turkey to Brazil – as transport planners increasingly adopt them as urban transport solutions. And their popularity is growing. Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Cardiff in Wales and Mecca in Saudi Arabia are all now at the planning stage of implementing cable-car transport.According to Steven Dale, a CPT strategist with The Gondola Project, part of Toronto-based Creative Urban Projects: “Ten years ago people thought the idea of urban cable cars ridiculous. Now almost every city in the developing world wants one”. He pointed out that they require less time and money – considerably less – to implement and are pollution free.Worldwide, CPT fulfills another function: sightseeing.

"Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time.This footage of a person apparently talking on a cellphone in a Charlie Chaplin film is just one clue that time travel is happening all around us.In this video it shows a supposed time traveller caught on tape on a CCTV camera, along with alleged teleportations that have been caught on tape.",SHOCKING! 10 Cases of Time Travel Caught On Camera
"A girl who’s always walking three times a day to study and reach her dreams was raped and killed by still unidentified man in Tigaon Camarines Sur Friday.According to the parents and adviser of the victim, the 15 year old girl is sometimes walking too far together with her brother to school.But before the crime happened, the victim didn’t go home with her brother that may possibly gave the suspect a chance to commit the crime to the victim.“Magkasama sila tuwing umuuwi kaya lang nu’ng time na ‘yun, nauna talagang umuwi ‘yung isa kaya malayo ‘yung distansiya so nagkaroon ng oportunidad ‘yung suspek na gumawa ng krimen,” ayon kay PO2 Maricel Adayo ng Tigaon – Philippine National Police (PNP).The area where the crime happened is remote, that’s why no one heard or witnessed the brutal rape-slay.The Tigaon PNP is still trying to investigate to unmask the suspect.Because of this, the Principal of the school where the victim studied asked the barangay officials to offer a free ride to all students who need to walk to their school.The victim was set to participate in their foundation day held this week.She’s known for being a good student and despite of the distance between her home and school, the victim didn’t miss her class.Because of a vicious criminal, all the dream of the victim to help her family someday was torn into pieces.The parents of the victim is hoping that the man who destroyed the dreams of their daughter would be apprehended immediately by the authorities.Source: ABS-CBN",Girl whos walking three hours a day just to study was raped and killed while going home from school

"Many people are consuming almost the same food every day, which is not good for their health. They are not aware that eating meats such as pork and beef can contain a specific type of worm that can seriously affect their health.Once these worms enters your body, they can move throughout your eyes, your tissues, and even in your brain. Just the thought of having these worms inside your body is a very scary thing, but all of this can actually happen.According to the team of doctors in Addenbrookes Hospital at Cambridge, a patient came to the hospital complaining of severe headaches.The patient came back after a while for some tests, this time he was complaining for new symptoms.He said, he had recently visited China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, which are known as the countries having the most reported cases of the parasite known as Spirometra Erinaceieuropaei.Along with headaches, the patient also experienced seizures and weakness which are symptoms caused by the parasites.After he was diagnosed with an infection sparganosis, the doctors quickly remove the worms with operation because this is the only way to cure this infection.Thaeniasis is defined as an infection caused by parasites, beef tapeworm, pork tapeworm and Asian tapeworm. People can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or under-cooked beef or pork.People can get infected by these tapeworms in two ways:- The first one is by consuming under-cooked pork from infected pigs.- Second one is through contact with swine or human feces.",CNN WARNS: Stop Eating This Type of Food Because Dangerous Worms May Appear Inside Your Body
"The daughter of Ozamiz Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog streams a live video on social networking site Facebook while the raid on their houses are commencing. She seemed worried in the said video as she calls out to her mother from her room where she and others including a baby stayed as CIDG storms the Parojinog residences.After the live stream of Naja Parojinog, granddaughter to Ozamiz mayor who was killed in that pre-dawn raid, a copy of it was automatically saved to her FB account where it was soon discovered by netizens after news of the incident broke on both mainstream and social media.Users of the said social media network had differing comments and opinions on the short footage with some pointing out that it was not the appropriate time to stream live videos on social media while your kith and kin were being killed in a firefight just meters from your room.Others defended the vice mayor's daughter's action by pointing out that it was understandable that she took a live video in such a frightening situation to document the incident as many would have done so too and that it could help other people understand what really went down during the raid.Alas, the video doesn't seem to have much in it that can offer more insights to what went down during the incident other than the fact that there's at least one child, a baby, in one of the houses who fortunately survived the clash.Watchbelow:",Daughter of Vice Mayor Parojinog Records Live Video During Raid At Their Home
"Vice President Leni Robredo said Malacañang could’ve chosen some other way to show her just how much it dislikes her instead of withdrawing the invitation it extended to her for Wednesday’s (Jan. 11) Vin d’ honneur.In an interview in Tondo Thursday (Jan. 12), Robredo took issue with Malacañang’s decision to disinvite her to the social event hosted by President Rodrigo Duterte.“Palace could’ve showed its dislike for me in some other way than ayaw ko na kasing palakihin. Para sa akin, hindi naman big deal kung iimbitahan ako o hindi. Nakakawalang gana na lang doon iyong manner kung paano ginagawa ang mga bagay,” she said.“Kasi kung galit sa akin, galit sa akin. Pero sana bigyan naman nang kaunting respeto ang opisina.Pero ang sa akin, okay naman iyon,” the Vice President added.Robredo’s spokesperson earlier said the Office of the Vice President received an invitation to the Vin d’honneur via e-mail on December 28, 2016 but Malacañang called on Jan. 4 to retract it, saying the guest list was limited.The Vice President said she had readily expressed her intention to attend the social event when her chief of staff staff informed her of the invitation last year.“Tumawag sa akin ang aking Chief of Staff, sinasabi niya na mayroon tayong imbitasyon, mag-aattend ka ba? Sabi ko sige, kung inimbitahan tayo, mag-aattend tayo,” she said.In Malacañang’s defense, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said it was the Palace’s prerogative to choose who would be on the guest list.The relationship between Duterte and Robredo reached a new low point after the President accused her of joining rallies calling for her ouster.Duterte said Robredo’s association with parties allegedly planning to unseat him was a reason why he didn’t want her to be part of his Cabinet anymore.The Vice President resigned as chair of the Housing and Urban Development and Coordinating Council in the early part of December 2016 after being told to stop attending Cabinet meetings.","Robredo demands respect from palace ""sana bigyan naman nang kaunting respeto ang opisina ng VP"""

"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board or LTFRB denied transport network company Uber's appeal to lift or at least shorten the one month suspension imposed upon them by the board.LTFRB said that Uber violated the board's order dated July 26, 2017 when the TNC continued accepting several applications despite an existing moratorium on the accreditation of new operators.“The Board expressly directed that there shall be No Acceptance of additional application for accreditation of Transport Network Vehicles Service (TNVS). The mere acceptance, much less, receipt and evaluation of documents submitted Applicants for accreditation is tantamount to a direct violation of the Order dated 26 July 2017,” the LTFRB said.According to Board Member Att. Aileen Lizada, Uber drivers who continue to operate despite suspension will be apprehended.In a report by Philippine Daily Inquirer, Lizada was quoted saying, “Now that the motion for reconsideration (MR) has been denied, our apprehension will continue.""She also asked Uber and its drivers for their cooperation as the LTFRB is also looking for solutions to address the issue.“So, to the transport network vehicle services (TNVS), please do not risk. We will find solutions for you. Rest assured that your concerns are being addressed. We’ll straighten things out for you, just be patient with us,” she said.Uber's management said it will abide by the ruling and work with LTFRB but also expressed disappointment with the denial of their motion for reconsideration.“We look forward to urgently resolving this matter, and thank the public for its support over the last 24 hours,” Uber said.","Uber's Appeal Denied by LTFRB, Drivers Who Continue to Operate Will Be Apprehended"
"Via 7 NEWSA 16-year-old teen, Sam Kanizay, went for a dip at the beach Saturday evening and walked out with tiny creatures eating up his legs. He did not feel it at first although the lower part of his legs was covered in blood when he emerged from the water.He initially thought he might have stepped on sharp rocks but the tiny pin-prick sized holes on his legs tells him that is not the case. His family said there were tiny marine creatures eating up at his legs.They washed the wounds with water but realized they could not stop the bleeding so they rushed Sam to the hospital where staff were baffled by the tiny pin-sized holes all over his legs. One of the nurses at the hospital suggests that it might be sea lice that bit him.The father of the victim decided to find out himself the next morning. He cast a net full of chunks of raw meat at the spot where his son had taken a dip. As he suspected, it was some tiny flesh eating marine creatures that tried to eat his son's legs. But what was it?No one knows what the creatures are exactly. Mr. Kanizay contacted a number of marine experts and other medic professionals around Melbourne and show them the footage he took of the little flesh-eaters feasting on chunks of raw meat, but no one could tell him what those tiny creatures are called.One marine life expert Michael Brown told Sunrise, a news website, that they might be ""jellyfish larvae"".""I've been doing this for coming on 20 years now and I've never seen anything like this,"" he said.According to Melbourne marine biologist Michael Keough, sea lice s the most probable culprit because they are known to be scavengers that cleans up dead fishes. Others disagree, though. Some people on the internet argues that sea lice are so small they can't inflict a wound that bleeds that much.",Mysterious Sea Creatures Caught After Vicious Attack On Teen At The Beach In Australia

"A flurry of announcements, promotions and corporate PR by the Philippines’ Big 2 telco providers recently, suggests that the duopoly are setting out their case to the incoming administration, and the public, that the country’s telecommunications sector is not in need of foreign intervention. They come on the heels of a warning from President Duterte that he is considering making the Internet public policy and that unless the current providers improve the speed and quality of access – particularly in the country’s 79 provinces outside the National Capital Region of Metro Manila – he will open the sector up to foreign competition.Globe Telecom (GT), announced that it is to launch a US$1 billion nationwide network-modernisation programme aimed at improving Internet access, with faster download and upload speeds, to 20,000 barangays – about 2 million home. It will connect these areas to the web with optical-fiber cable and this year’s US$750 million worth of allotted capital expenditure will go toward the cost. Implementation is expected to take five years. Announcing the programme, Globe president and CEO, Ernest Cu, said that success will require cooperation from the government and homeowners’ associations.In tandem, Globe Business, GT’s business-solutions arm, announced that it is “ushering in uninterrupted” data and digital services, employing the latest information and communications technology (ICT) capabilities and innovations, across Philippine enterprises. Business has been among the most vocal critics of the country’s connectivity and has made repeated overtures to government to get something done, contending that it is costing their businesses and the economy as a whole billions of dollars in revenue, annually.Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) had earlier announced that the group would be investing US$538 million on the network integration of its two mobile units, Smart and Sun Cellular, and on network upgrades for its 3G and Long Term Evolution (LTE) network in an effort to increase mobile coverage. This will account for more than half of the US$926 million which the company has earmarked for its 2016 capital-expenditure programme. The plan is to double its coverage of LTE. Smart recently deployed its LTE-Advance mobile service with significantly higher data speeds than previous LTE packages, paving the way for a 4G mobile network with greater area coverage.Welcome developments all, but in a region where every country is ploughing its resources into improving connectivity through 4G networks, for everything from personal use to e-commerce and the logistics of transacting business, and as South Korea gets close to introducing a 5G mobile network, the public must wonder whether its two giant telco corporations are financially committed to making the Philippines Internet competitive. Presently, in an Asia context, the country’s LTE capability in terms of area coverage and download speed is lagging.LTE national coverage: South Korea 97%; Japan 90%; Hong Kong, 86%; Singapore 84%; China 76%; Taiwan 73%; Thailand 54%; Malaysia 48%; Indonesia 43%; Philippines 39%. LTE download speed (Mbps): Singapore 33; South Korea, 29; Taiwan 18; Japan 14; China 14; Malaysia 12; Hong Kong 11; Indonesia 9; Thailand 8; Philippines 8;One thing we are quite confident about is that Duterte and his secretary at the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) will require more than window-dressing by the Big 2 if the telecom giants are remain at the top of the Philippine’s telco food chain. They will be expected to provide copper-bottom guarantees – possibly penalty-linked – for a detailed list of prioritised works with scheduled completion dates. The new administration is keen to get connectivity on track and very quickly.",Efforts to connect with the public
"One of the problems of the country is the overpopulation in urban areas, and Sackur was able to identify that the family who can’t avail health services are the ones producing more offsprings. The Church condemns the government for promoting alternative family planning methods that would help these less privileged families to plan for their family.Sackur was able to pinpoint one of the root causes of poverty and that is overpopulation, which leads to underprivileged children, juvenile crimes and increase of juvenile delinquency and involvement in criminal acts and drug related incidents.Krizette Chu stated that Sackur was able to see the neglected side of the society, how real they are and how they lived, and Trillanes might not have seen any of these. She also said that in contrary to the bashers of Sackur, Stephen Sackur was not just an ordinary news anchor. Sackur was an excellent field reporter (sample of this was he was able to grasp the vital issues in the country in just a short span of time) before he landed on the news anchor job.Watch related video below:source Public TrendingKrizzete Laureta Chu, posted in her Facebook timeline the video of which Stephen Sackur conducted an in depth observation and interviewed significant people and the grassroots about the emerging issues in the Philippines.Stephen Sackur visited the country last 2015 to feature the Philippines in his current events program HARDTalk. In the featured video, he pointed out the effects of the demographics to the economic status of the country. He said theSackur was able to see the side of growing opportunity in Business Process outsourcing or call-center services in layman’s term. While the same services were considered to be a low prestige job in US and UK, here in the Philippines, Sackur found out that BPO is one of the high paying jobs in the country. Sackur described Metro Manila as a provider of stable jobs because of the BPO industry and hailed the Philippines as the call center capital of the world.Sackur saw that the economic growth provided by the BPOs cannot keep up with the growth of the population, that is why many Filipinos chose to be employed abroad to provide their families’ needs.Sackur was able to witness the life in the slums as he went to see the biggest slum in the Philippines and that was Tondo. He stated that majority of the people lived by taking scrap materials and even scrap foods. Sackur was also able to meet street children, deprived youths with the rights that they must enjoy and being exposed to drugs, crime and prostitution at a very young age.",Here's why BBC's Stephen Sackur knows PH situation more than Trillanes
"In a forum held recently at the UP Diliman in Quezon City, representatives from various government agencies, local government units and non-governmental and people's organizations came out in one voice for ""better coordination and wider participation"" to ensure the welfare and safety of children during emergencies and disasters.The groups also lauded the initiatives of Save the Children for its ""innovative integrated approach"" in ensuring ""child-centered and child-led"" DRR programs by combining disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and solid waste management - through its EnCoRe (Enhancing the Resilience of Urban Communities to Disasters & Climate Change) Program. Children’s Challenge to Government Through songs and dances, around thirty children presented their issues and concerns to the government officials present during the event.They called for “inclusion” of children’s agenda in government programs. Aina Pachoco, a student of Arsenio Santos Memorial Elementary School in Calumpit, Bulacan, led all the guests in pledging for their commitment to “walk the talk,” saying that what transpired should truly redound to the full protection of children.“Sana po, maging totoo po lahat nang napagusapan, para sa aming mga bata,” Pachoco said. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Child Participation in DRR Activities At the forum, a memorandum of agreement (MoA) was signed by Ned Olney, Country Director of Save the Children Philippine Country Office and DILG Secretary Mar Roxas.Co-signing the MOA were 11 year old Marvin Sambilay, and Monica Baltero, 15 years old, both residing in Bulacan, one of the perennially affected provinces during calamities. DILG Director for national barangay operations, Leocadio Trovela, represented Secretary Roxas during the affair. DepEd regional director Isabelita Borres and DENR Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia witnessed the ceremony.The two agencies are still finalizing their separate MoAs with the NGO, but has already committed in principle, to adopt the Australian government-funded, ENCORE project. The agreement sought to formalize the commitment of various government leaders and representatives of non-governmental and people's organizations on the need for children's participation in DRR activities as a ""shared responsibility"" by all sectors of Philippine society.Muntinlupa City mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan Provincial Administrator Eugenio Payongayong, together with several mayors of the province, were also present as their local governments are the immediate target beneficiaries of the project. Olney said, ""Our recently-signed document would save and protect the lives of many children.Before there was only a legal and nominal recognition to the role of children in disaster risk reduction with Section 14 of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction Management Act of 2010.“Today, we have the commitment of important sectors in society - especially those in government - to ensure the participation of children in assessing hazards and vulnerabilities in their communities.There are so many things that have to be done in order to create and maintain disaster-resilient communities. So much work can be spread out, even to children, with their meaningful contributions to disaster risk reduction programs.We demonstrate this in our child-centered and child-led DRR initiatives in our pilot areas for the ENCoRe Program in Bulacan and in Muntinlupa,"" Olney added.Government Officials vow Promotion of ""Child-Centered DRR"" Government officials led by Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG) Director Leocadio Trovela of the national barangay operations, Department of Education (DepEd) Regional Director Isabelita Borres and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia, all expressed their support to the program.The international NGO said people who underwent drills and seminars on disaster awareness are more likely to survive emergencies and natural calamities.Reaction from LGU beneficiaries of the EnCoRe Program The forum, which marks the second phase of the EnCoRe program, was previously focused on just two pilot areas: Bulacan and Muntinlupa. Both areas have been identified ""red"" in the hazard map of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC).Mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan administrator Eugenio Payongayong, took turns in lauding the project that would immediately benefit their constituents.For More info/media inquiries: PLEASE CONTACT: Edchelle Flores, Communications Assistant Enhancing the Resilience of Urban Communities to Disasters and Climate Change Project Mobile: +63 9168714981, Skype: edchelleflores, Email: Edchelle.Flores@savethechildren.org Lany dela Cruz Communications Officer | +63 09255556290 Save the Children Philippine Country Office, 2F Midland Bldg. 1040 EDSA, Magallanes Village, Makati City, Tel. +632 8532142About Save The Children:Save the Children is the world’s leading independent organization for children.

"#####As a single parent with no stable income, I have no capacity to send my children to a private school and public school is the only option. More so, I cannot afford for any hospitalization. I am in such a hand-to-mouth existence that I wasn’t able to even pay/update my Philhealth contributions. So when the government –DOH thru DepEd launched a program of vaccines for dengue, I was happy because I believed that my children can now be safe from dengue, safe from any eventual hospitalization due to the dengue virus (sickness).I fully trusted the government, that the DOH and all the people in charge of this program have sound judgment and are 100% sure that the vaccine is 100% safe, not harmful and only useful to the Filipino citizens especially to children.I cannot believe until now that our government can use our children to become guinea pigs. Until this very hour I cannot contain my fear for the life of my child.On Nov. 14, 2017 my son K**** A**** had fever accompanied with terrible headache, diarrhea and vomiting. I only self medicate since I don’t have money to bring him to the doctor. On the 3rd day he no longer have fever and the diarrhea has stopped so on the fourth day I already sent him to school.But on the following week that’s November 22,2017 he again had fever. He doesn’t want to move because he had a terrible headache, muscle and joint pains, pain in his nape and in his eyeballs. He also have diarrhea and vomit everytime he eats or drink. Again I only self medicate because of financial constraint. I only give him biogesic, papaya sap and oresol.On November 25, 2017. he had convulsions and he was already dehydrated. I gave dolan suppository and gave him pocari sweats and buko juice. That’s when I was able to borrow money and finally bring him to a doctor for consultation and did laboratory tests.The result shows that his platelet is already high but he already has infections in his urine and and his white blood count is also high. He was given co-amoxiclav.The following day, his fever already subside. And because I have no money I wasn’t able to bring him to the hospital but all the symptoms of dengue manifested in him.It's been four days since I heard the news about the vaccine and it’s dangers and I couldn’t sleep until now, thinking how dangerous the situation my son faces. And I cannot forgive myself if something bad happens to him. I already have this trauma. And I wanted to know and have him checked through blood test if indeed he just had dengue so I can monitor my child closely. I cannot have peace of mind until the test is done but I cannot afford it on my own.I have watched Sec Harry Roque's press conference with Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy on Dengvaxia and I am so frustrated, disappointed and I felt betrayed. I cannot believe how the government downplayed the dengue issue.I cannot believe how Sec. Roque, being the mouthpiece of the president, could make pronouncements that are not factual. His ignorance to the subject ( dengue sickness) is not an excuse for him to make statements that is contrary to the real effect or real condition having a severe dengue. He should not let the public go blind on a real condition with a severe dengue.On the contrary, he should have at least educated the people especially the parents of recipients of that vaccine so we could assist our children carefully. I have followed posts on FB pages of several doctors for a week now and I learned a lot from them. Their posts are very informative and they explained it in laymans terms, so that any parent could easily understand how the dengue works in the body, how it could affect the other vital organs and how it can endanger the patient.Doctors like Dr Richard Mata, Dr Willie Ong and others.I am disappointed at how the government downplayed the issue. the harm, the danger the physical and emotional issues we parents are battling now.I have come to ask myself: where can we go and ask help? Who would help us if the government is very reluctant. How can we seek justice?Then it came to my mind: where else would we asked help but to the very agency who caused danger to our children? It is this agency's negligence that the lives our children is now at risk, their safety uncertain.Therefore I now ask the DoH thru you Sir to please help us in every way. This is the least that this government/Dept (DOH) can do for us. I for myself am asking for blood test for my child so I may know if he just got infected with dengue or not. And I need a written assurance from DOH that the it will shoulder all medical , laboratory fees , hospital bills from the onset of fever…meaning from monitoring to actual confinement to all/any hospital may it be public or private whichever is nearer when time/need arises.Please stop asking us to go to public hospitals if it is too far from our residence because some of us if not most don’t even have money for transportation. And we have to really consider the distance as it could affect a lot to the well being of the patient and to the guardian as well.I am also awaiting some measures from the government such as maybe giving insect repellents to the 10% of the recipients in which the DOH spokesperson claimed who has not infected with dengue prior to immunizations. Or maybe the government will again conduct the brgy “smoke something” to eradicate mosquitoes. Or anything that could help these 10% free from dengue . I am sure this measures is not as expensive as the cost of the vaccines itself.I also understand that this problem is not caused by the present administration but still it is the government who made it happened or bring this great danger to the lives of the children. So please let us for now just simply think And consider the welfare, the lives of the recipients.Although in my innermost self I wanted all the people behind it, Aquino, Garin and the rest to be jailed but what truly matters now is the life of my son. And the assistance I am now seeking.Thank you so much.I**** A*****Parent[: I withheld her phone number for her own protection.

"“They are alive, you talk to them and tell them they would end up in a very serious situation if they continued (involvement in drugs),” the President said referring to drug suspect on the lists.The President stated that the priests had done nothing to help him in his campaign against drug, instead they “easily condemn” it. On the other hand, the Church leaders have shown support for the anti-drug campaign but stated they are against the killings associated with it.President Duterte also asked Church leaders to talk to village chiefs. Village chairs, he said, were not in the frontline of this war on drugs because “40 percent of them are involved in drugs. You see? That’s how serious the problem is.”“We are now a narcostate. You ask why I did not tap the barangay captains (village chiefs)? I cannot trust the idiots anymore,” the President said.He stated he had to tap the military’s help in destroying drug factories and running after all drug suspects. He’s no longer trust the village chiefs because of the involvement of many village officials in drugs. But he emphasized that his order did not include killing the suspects.“You can ask the military or the police in Manila if I ordered them to (kill drug suspects). If anyone of them stands up and say I ordered them to kill the poor and the children, I would resign because that would make me a liar.”“That’s the truth,” he added.He said the Church would always find fault in his antidrug campaign because of what he said were irreconcilable positions on how to deal with the drug menace.“For them, it’s pity and not hatred,” the President said. “No response. But the law is not like that.

"Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet by patients with known heart or cerebrovascular disease was independently linked with a marked reduction in their risk of all-cause mortality in the Italian Moli-Sani Study, reported at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology.Subjects in the top tertile in terms of food intake consistent with the Mediterranean diet were 37 percent less likely to die during more than seven years of follow-up than were those in the bottom tertile, according to the head of the department of epidemiology and prevention at the IRCCS Mediterranean Neurologic Institute in Pozzilli, Italy.The message for physicians is clear: “Doctors can’t look to statins, aspirin and other cardiovascular drugs as the only way to secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease. Suggestions to follow healthy dietary habits are as important as prescribing drugs.”The Moli-Sani Study is an ongoing population-based epidemiologic study of 25,000 adults in the mountainous, heavily agricultural Molise region of southern Italy. The one who directs the study, presented a sub study involving 1,197 participants with established coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease at entry. Their average age at enrollment was 66 years. Subjects with coronary heart disease outnumbered those with cerebrovascular disease by roughly 2:1.Food intake was recorded using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) foodfrequency questionnaire. Investigator assessed adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), a validated 0-9 scoring system developed as part of the famous Seven Countries Study.During a median 7.3 years of prospective follow -up, 208 deaths occurred in the study population. A 2 – point increase in the MDS was independently associated with a 21 percent reduction in the risk of mortality in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted for “everything we could think of,” including baseline demographics, socioeconomic status, energy intake, body mass index, leisure time physical activity, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking status diabetes, standard cardiovascular medications.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Subjects in the top tertile for adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with an MDS of 6-9, had an adjusted 37 percent relative risk reduction in all – cause mortality, compared with those having MDS of 0-3.The number of deaths is too small at this point in the prospective study to permit analysis of specific causes of death in a statistically valid manner. With another 3 years or so of follow-up, that analysis can and will be done.The traditional Mediterranean diet is an eating pattern characteristic of the Mediterranean basin. It encourages large intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, and cereals, along with moderately high consumption of fish, olive oil as the primary fat source, and moderate alcohol intake during meal, but low to moderate intake of dairy products and low consumption of meat and poultry.As a sobering aside, in the Molise region, far and away the biggest obstacle to adherence to the Mediterranean diet is economic. “There was no difference in adherence to the Mediterranean diet between different socioeconomic classes in the Moli-Sani Study until 2007-2008, when the Italian economic crisis began. Since then, there are significant differences according to socioeconomic condition. Poor people are obliged to follow the Mediterranean diet less.” Telling a patient with cardiovascular disease who is in a low -income family to eat fish at least twice per week is impractical advice.",Mediterranean diet for secondary prevention cuts all-cause mortality  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Josephine Lapira was a former student of the University of the Philippines.She is known as an activist who regularly promote her political beliefs to women and recruited them to join her. She was the Secretary General of the Gabriela Youth.She was one of the 15 killed in the firefight.The AFP has retrieved personal belongings, guns, foods and grenades from the rebels. The fight broke when authorities received a tip that several rebels are on their way for an operation.Maj. Engelberto Nioda Jr., commander of the PAF 730th Combat Group, said authorities were tipped off to the presence of vehicles “full of armed rebels” in Nasugbu, 65 kilometers south of Manila.Delvo said joint police and military checkpoints were set up on the routes to Calatagan and Balayan towns after they received information about the vehicles.“We were expecting them to pass by that road, as that would be the usual exit route, but they instead took a turn and headed toward the direction of Tagaytay [Cavite]. There were also checkpoints there,” Delvo said.The authorities encountered two – an unmarked jeepney and a van – in the adjacent villages of Aga and Kaylaway, along the dimly lit part of the Tagaytay-Nasugbu highway.“The jeep did not stop [for inspection] and [the passengers] opened fire at our troops,” Delvo said.Meanwhile, CPP-NPA Chief Joma Sison is calling the Commission of Human Rights to investigate the killings of his 15 warriors.Your thoughts on this?

"“Kapag hindi ka su-surrender, mapapatay ka talaga. Mapapatay ka talaga kung hindi ka susurrender” — the Philippine National Police chief Dir. Gen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa said to Kerwin Espinosa last month as per a an Inquirer story.Despite several warnings from Bato, Kerwin resists to yield himself to the authorities.Since Duterte assumed his presidency, Kerwin had already been hiding and it was reported that he flew to Malaysia after undergoing a plastic surgery.In his speech in Palo, Leyte on Tuesday, Bato called the attention of the Police Regional Office 8 to hold the responsibility in capturing Kerwin; the number 1 drug lord in Eastern Visayas. Even though Kerwin had changed his identity through plastic surgery, Bato believes that through their diligence, along with the entire nation, they would be able to locate him as soon as possible.Earlier in August, Albuera Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. had surrendered after he was threatened by the strong remarks of Bato and after President Duterte himself declared “shoot on sight” if he resist.The mayor had been identified as one of the drug protectors of illegal drug trading in Leyte. Along with his family, Espinosa Sr. is presently under Bato’s supervision.During a press conference, Espinosa Sr. acknowledged to the public that his son Kerwin is also involved in the illegal drug trade and that he was being supplied with drugs by Peter Co; a drug lord who is currently detained at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City. However, he disclosed that he does not have any clue where his son could be found since the day Duterte won his presidency.",Public Trending

"Venezuela’s ruling socialists swept nearly all the races for mayors across the country, and President Nicolas Maduro is now threatening to ban key opposition parties from future elections in the oil-rich country wracked by economic crisis.Hundreds of supporters shouted “Go home, Donald Trump” to interrupt Maduro at a rally late Sunday in the colonial centre of Caracas, where he announced that pro-government candidates grabbed more than 300 of the 335 mayoral offices.Sunday’s voting marked the last nationwide elections before next year’s presidential race when Maduro is expected to seek another term despite his steep unpopularity.“The imperialists have tried to set fire to Venezuela to take our riches,” Maduro told the crowd. “We’ve defeated the American imperialists with our votes, our ideas, truths, reason and popular will.”Triple-digit inflationThe elections played out as Venezuelans struggle with triple-digit inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and charges that Maduro’s government has undermined democracy by imprisoning dissidents and usurping the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.Three of the four biggest opposition parties refused to take part in Sunday’s contests, protesting what they called an electoral system rigged by a “dictator.” The last time the opposition refused to compete in congressional elections in 2005 it strengthened the government’s hand for years.A militia member casts her vote at a polling station during a nationwide election for new mayors in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sunday.

The country saw months of protests that left more than 120 dead earlier this year, and it is now facing U.S. economic sanctions as it seeks to refinance a huge international debt.The struggles have caused the president’s approval rating to plunge, although the opposition has been largely unable to capitalize on Maduro’s unpopularity.People look for their names on electoral rolls before voting in the municipal elections in Caracas on Sunday.

Maduro’s opponents on social media questioned the figures.‘Absolutely predictable’The mayoral elections follow a crushing defeat of opposition candidates in October’s gubernatorial elections, where anti-Maduro candidates won just five of 23 races amid allegations of official vote-buying and other irregularities.Given the opposition’s disarray, political analysts said they doubted Maduro’s opponents would be able to rally behind a single candidate in next year’s presidential election.“These were absolutely predictable results,” local pollster Luis Vicente Leon said on Twitter. “It’s absurd to think that an abstaining political force can win the majority of mayorships.”",Venezuelas ruling socialists romp to victory in mayoral elections  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"A new study out of York University suggests most white children as young as five years old show racial bias in favour of other white children.Researchers in Toronto conducted several tests involving more than 350 white children to gain a better understanding of implicit bias, which is bias that is automatic and unbeknownst to the individual.The participants completed a child-friendly version of the implicit association test (IAT), a recognized bias test developed by researchers at Harvard University.They were shown a series of photos on a computer screen, each one featuring either a white boy or a black boy, and for each image the children were asked to choose with their mouse whether it made them feel happy or sad.Both age groups, five- to eight-year-olds and nine- to 12-year-olds, showed greater positivity toward white children than black children.Another test involved what’s known as an affect misattribution procedure (AMP). The children were shown either a black child, white child or grey square. Milliseconds later, they were shown an ink blot and asked if the blot was pleasant or unpleasant. Researchers say the answer exposes bias toward the image shown before the ink blot.The researchers found, overall, there was no evidence the children displayed either negative or positive attitudes toward black children.“They were showing positivity toward white kids, but not necessarily negativity toward black kids,” lead researcher Jennifer Steele told CBC News.Egocentric attitudesOne reason for the bias may be the fact that young children — up to about eight years old — tend to be egocentric, believing that they are better than others, researchers say.Though the children didn’t express negativity toward black children, Steele says they were still indicating a preference for other white children.“It’s still a racial bias, but it just gives us a little more information about the nature of that bias, which then can allow us to reflect a little bit on what an appropriate intervention might be or what might benefit kids if we’re just trying to increase a positive attitude toward a diverse group of kids in a classroom, for example.”York University researcher Jennifer Steele says teaching children positive attitudes early on could benefit them as they get older. (Shutterstock/Rawpixel.com)The study found that in the AMP test, older children — aged nine to 12 — didn’t show a positive bias toward white children.The researchers suggest this is because they’ve developed an appreciation for the differences in others, and have begun focusing on associating with those who share common characteristics, such as social interests. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the implicit bias they might have displayed a few years earlier won’t return.Increasing positivitySteele, who also plans to study bias in black children, says most research suggests trying to eliminate implicit bias by focusing on getting rid of negative attitudes isn’t the best approach.“Instead, focusing more on trying to help children acquire positive attitudes to people from … different racial groups or different ethnic groups or people from different backgrounds, I think, is probably the best approach.”And while some experts believe that teaching children to be colour-blind and not place people into racial groups might be a way to eliminate racial bias, Steele and others argue this could leave children unable to identify discrimination when they witness it.‘Through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds.’ – Jennifer Steele, York University“It’s that lack of discussion that can lead to increases in bias,” said Sarah Gaither, an assistant professor in Duke University’s department of psychology and neuroscience.However, having those discussions is a delicate matter with its own challenges, she says.“If you’re not taking the colour-blind approach … that leads to the question: do you teach white children that perhaps they’re privileged in our society instead? It’s this awareness of privilege that we need to figure out how to talk to kids about,” she told CBC News. “No one likes to be told that they’re biased or privileged.”And doing so, she says, could increase that bias accidentally.Steele says exposing children to a variety of races and cultures at an early age is important.“Fortunately, now with the internet there are so many different ways we can expose children to diversity, and through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds,” Steele said.“And exposing them to that so they’re aware of that is valuable and important.”","Kids as young as 5 show racial bias, research suggests  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"Senator De Lima argues a point at the Senate hearing on Extra Judicial Killing (EJK). Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA - Malacañang on Monday denied accusations of an international human rights group that the drug cases against Senator Leila de Lima are politically motivated, insisting that these are “criminal in nature.”Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the group Human Rights Watch (HRW) disregards the rights of the Philippines as a nation that must be protected against illegal drugs by calling on ""foreign governments to step up to denounce the Duterte administration"" for alleged human rights violations.“It banally disregards the right of a nation to protect its citizens against the menace of a global drug industry, and terrorist-connected drug trade; and that it has done so with assumption of regularity,” Abella said in a statement.The HRW on Sunday said the Duterte administration is abusing the judicial system to punish critics of its drug war, such as the drug cases filed against De Lima, who once initiated a Senate inquiry into the President's bloody campaign against illegal drugs.""The prosecution of Senator Leila de Lima is an act of political vindictiveness that debases the rule of law in the Philippines,” said Phelim Kine, HRW deputy Asia director.The group also noted that attacks against De Lima intensified after a witness, self-professed hitman Edgar Matobato, accused the President of ordering assassinations when he was still Davao mayor.The Department of Justice last Friday filed three drug trafficking cases against De Lima for which bail may be denied.“De Lima's case is not politically motivated. It is, simply put, 'criminal in nature.' The human rights organization might bear that in mind before it attempts to obligate the Duterte administration,” Abella said.Abella added that the HRW broadly paints the ""killings of thousands of alleged drug uses and drug dealers after Duterte took office on June 30"" - without identifying what deaths belonged to police operations, deaths not related to drugs and extrajudicial killings.“Human Rights Watch blithely ignores the approximately 1,000,000 users and dealers who turned themselves in, the discovery of industrial size illegal drug factories, and the unimaginable extent that 'narco-politics' has gripped local politics, law-enforcement and to some extent the legislative and judicial departments,” Abella said.If found guilty, De Lima faces between 12 years to life in prison. Under the law, legislators only enjoy privilege from arrest for crimes punishable by less than 6 years imprisonment.",Palace denies De Lima drug cases are 'politically motivated'
"(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File)NEW YORK (AP) — The federal anti-racketeering law has been used since the late 1970s to bring down mob bosses. Could it be used to prosecute Harvey Weinstein?Lawyers for six actresses who say they were sexually assaulted by the movie producer filed a lawsuit Wednesday in New York arguing that Weinstein was, essentially, a racketeer who used a legion of assistants, casting agents, security firms, gossip writers and others to supply himself with a steady stream of unwilling sexual partners and silence their complaints.Their anti-racketeering suit was filed in a civil court, but it prompted discussions about whether prosecutors could make a similar criminal case.Maybe, said G. Robert Blakey, a professor emeritus at the University of Notre Dame law school who helped write the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. But it wouldn’t be easy.“It would take imagination and intestinal fortitude,” he said.“Prosecutors have been singularly lacking in both when it comes to women making complaints of sexual assault against powerful men.”The law was drafted to bring down organized crime but it isn’t limited to it, Blakey said.It has been used by prosecutors used to go after rule-breaking Wall Street firms and corrupt government contractors. Federal prosecutors are currently using it to battle alleged bribery in global soccer in a trial ongoing in Brooklyn.Many hurdles in proving racketeeringBut a criminal anti-racketeering case also has many hurdles, Blakey said.Federal prosecutors would have to prove that a criminal enterprise existed, it affected interstate commerce and the defendant was associated with and engaged in racketeering.It would also have to be brought within five years of the conspiracy ending, he said. The racketeering statute is a federal law, though some states, like New York and California, have similar state laws.The women suing Weinstein in civil court said the “Weinstein Sexual Enterprise” consisted of a long list of people who either enabled Weinstein’s assaults or covered them up.Their claims were based partly on reporting by The New York Times and the New Yorker, both of which published exposes saying that Weinstein took extraordinary steps to conceal complaints, including hiring security firms to investigate reporters working on possible stories and working with other media to discredit women who might come forward.“The goal of the (anti-racketeering) claim is to ensure not only do we get the head of the enterprise, but also those around him who enabled his conduct, whether they tampered with witnesses or destroyed evidence after the fact, or even delivered the women to him,” said Beth Fegan, the lead lawyer on the civil suit.‘Pretty far out there’“Law enforcement is having a tough enough of a time making out a simple sexual assault case against Weinstein; the idea that they could pull off a RICO indictment is pretty far out there,” said Jeffrey Lichtman, a defense attorney who defended John “Junior” Gotti, son of the infamous “Teflon Don” or “Dapper Don,” John Gotti.“Prosecutors are concerned about one thing, getting a conviction and putting a bad guy away, and they attempt to do so in the simplest and straightforward manner possible due to the high beyond a reasonable doubt standard,” he wrote in an email.On the other hand, a prosecutor could investigate the allegations in the civil complaint in an effort to seek broader accountability for complacency, said Julie O’Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white collar criminal law at Georgetown Law.“Assuming these allegations are true, if I were a prosecutor, I’d be asking: “Do I want to just go after him? Or do I think the larger criminal wrong involves a lot of people who facilitated this criminal conduct?” she asked.Weinstein’s attorneys, Blair Berk and Ben Brafman, said in a statement that all the allegations of sexual assault against him are false.They said he never used company resources at Miramax or The Weinstein Company for personal expenses, including the payment of any legal settlements. Weinstein, though a spokesman, has also denied the allegations that he sought damaging information on the actresses.At least 75 women have accused Weinstein of unwanted come-ons, groping and outright rape. He’s under criminal investigation in Los Angeles, London, Beverly Hills and in New York. No federal officials have said they are investigating him. As of yet, no criminal charges have been brought. Some of the allegations involve encounters with women many years ago, outside the statute of limitations.

"Apparently when Mr. Warg got,himself into the CSC servers, he accessed and allegedly stole email addresses, passwords and other information of over 10,000 policemen, snooped,around the European border control,database and snatched a few million social security,numbers of Danish citizens. If it’s true I can understand the Danish,government’s “uneasiness”. All of this supposedly,occurred over a period of 6 months,during the initial breech. Although it happened from about,February to August in 2012 it still brings to light a few,interesting thoughts.According to Warg’s defense,team the hacks were definitely carried out on a computer that was OWNED by Warg. This same computer,was accessed by a number of different developers in Warg’s group and any one of them could have been the,responsible party. This seems to mirror the idea that, if you lend,someone your car and they accidentally kill a person with it, YOU are responsible. It’s definitely an arguable point.The big, ugly, greasy,monkey wrench in that whole theory is Mr. Warg’s own record and reputation since getting,accused of this invasion. He was initially arrested in his apartment in Cambodia In September of 2012 but, before Denmark could,extradite him, He was deported to Sweden to serve jail time for copyright theft because of being,involved with TPB (The Pirate Bay). While in Sweden he was tried yet again for hacking into a bank’s computers. He was finally taken to Denmark in November of 2013 and sat there for a bit. So, it took two years before he went to trial in Denmark for the CSC breeches. I wonder how much,disappeared in that time? Subsequently, Mr. Warg was sentenced to 3.5 years jail time as opposed to the,maximum of 6 years for this type of infraction to the law.This little piggy,would like to know if Mr. Warg was convicted by being associated with other hacking crimes or because he physically did it? Considering,there was no evidence found by the computer forensics “officials” pointing,directly to him as the actual culprit. Why was he convicted and his 21 year old partner (whose name was,withheld to protect his privacy…*cough cough*) walked off with time served? Was Mr. Warg portrayed as a horrible,man that attacked governments to a jury that really didn’t understand anything about technology? Was he a cyber-terrorist in the making? Is it all a giant, stinking pile of cow manure? The world may never know.It seems to,simply boil down to this; a man has been convicted by the legal system with evidence given to that system by a powerful,company instead of investigators finding their own.",Public Trending
"CONTRIBUTED PHOTOWith Christian Standhardinger playing for the enemy on Sunday, there was a handful of fans who booed the Fil-German big man inside Mall of Asia Arena.But that was the least of Standhardinger’s concerns.His focus was to lead Hong Kong to victory and he delivered at the expense of Tanduay Alab Pilipinas to open their campaign in the 2018 Asean Basketball League.“I didn’t hear the booing. I think I just love the Filipino fans so if they cheer for me or boo me, it’s okay,” He said after the Eastern Long Lions’ 92-89 win.Making his Philippine debut on Sunday, Standhardinger made his ABL debut in front of Filipino fans and passed his first test with flying colors with 26 points, 14 rebounds, four assists, and two steals.His presence in the endgame was also crucial in Hong Kong holding off the home team with two crucial buckets in the final 20 seconds.Standhardinger said that he likes what he sees with his new team, which is aiming back-to-back titles.“It’s good. We’re a great team and you see them fighting hard. They’re good guys and we just have to improve even more and work hard. I hope we come out of this season with more victories,” he said.Standhardinger also commended Alab and his former Gilas Pilipinas teammate Bobby Ray Parks, who led the late game rally and almost stole the win.“They really got everything in us. And Ray was a killer,” he said.“Luckily, we just stuck together because it was really hard. You can lose your focus, you can lose in your emotions. We got frustrated, but we kept going. We kept working hard and in the end, we came out with a victory as good as they are. I was just happy it was us who got the win.”Standhardinger hopes to hear cheers from the Filipino crowd next time he plays in the country.“I hope someday I can hear the cheers again.

"Once the “ber” months really go into full swing, a game of celebratory roulette comes into play — that ubiquitous round robin among friends of Christmas parties, holiday cocktails and homecoming get-togethers begins and inevitably it’s your turn. Hosting duties are always fun but not always easy, as the “ber” months also mean piled-on work and tying up loose ends before the end of the year. Here are some great ideas for virtually hassle-free entertaining, where you barely have to lift a finger and everything you need is just a call or click away!The luxurious meriendaBring out that inherited silver tea set and invite your old school friends over for a boozy and luxurious afternoon get-together. Make little bite-sized sandwiches using Nicole Ortega’s latest spread under her new luxe label “Silver Platter.” Nicole’s newest creation is a delicious and decadent take on a classic chicken spread using generous pieces of chicken whipped into a creamy cheese base dotted with sweet cranberries and a heady mix of fresh truffle. You can also order a batch of her famous Cheese Pimiento for that satisfying, comfort-food fix. Throw in some mini-eclairs and sweet tarts from Eric Kayser and you are good to go! Don’t forget a well-chilled bottle of bubbly! For orders, contact 0927-485-3399.The apero hourMake it à la Parisienne and forgo the heavy meal or even plates and cutlery, for that matter. Take inspiration from the City of Lights’ practice of winding the day down and beginning the evening with drinks and nibbles, ultimately getting full enough to just carry on drinking to the wee hours of the morning discussing politics, philosophy, love and conquest.Aperitif offers beautifully presented “grazing” platters customized to fit the size of your group and budget — an assortment of cheese, cold cuts, nuts, honey and jams, crackers, breads, and other delightful bites all ready for immediate nibbling. And because we can’t seem to escape our sweet tooth, they offer dessert stations as well.Aperitif has such an amazing, Instagram-worthy presentation that you don’t even need to buy flowers! The only thing missing is the booze. Pick up a few bottles of a crowd-pleasing New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, an easy-drinking Grenache-based red and your favorite beer.Having a big crowd over? Call Engkanto Brewery and inquire about their keg setups at 0998-998-2017 or email sales@napagapa.com .

One of my secret weapons for last-minute hosting duties is to bust out my raclette maker and let guests cook for themselves. Don’t forget the traditional condiments: boiled potatoes, cornichons and pickled onions. You can also add some air-dried beef or bresaola and some grilled sausages if you’re looking for something heavier. I almost always have a green salad on hand just to refresh the palate. Arrange things nicely for easy serving. If even boiling potatoes is too much of a hassle, you can simply call Raclette Manila and they’ll do it all for you. Try serving a Chenin Blanc or Pinot Noir with your raclette. Contact Raclette Manila at raclettemnl@gmail.com or IG @raclettemnl.The intimate wine & cheese-pairing partyThis is a great idea for smaller groups of 10 or so people. Have a selection of six cheeses aptly paired with wines. Chèvre with a Sauvignon Blanc, Roquefort with a Sauterne, Manchego with Rioja… all it takes is a bit of quick research on the Internet to find some classic pairings. Aim for a different variety of hard and soft cheeses from different kinds of milk and even different countries. Create mini tasting stations with the cheese next to the corresponding wine, along with some tasting notes or funny quotes.To make things more interesting, serve them with these artisanal cheese-pairing jams by Grace Baja, a.k.a. “The Spoiled Mummy.” Her latest line, called “Taste by Grace Home” also carries two delicious cheese spreads: Quattro Formaggio with Pink Peppercorn and Manchego Curado with Almonds, as well as a buttery-smooth Chicken Liver Pâté with Pistachios. Don’t forget to serve a big bowl of green salad for digestion! Contact Taste by Grace Home at 0906-361-8374.The porchetta partySome of us can’t live on cheese and cold cuts alone and need heftier nosh. Also, there isn’t any real celebration if you don’t have that iconic lechon, right? Here’s a fresh take on that tradition: order the scrumptious Roast Pork Belly of Dulce Magat Gibb. Golden, crisp skin that crackles and crunches, yielding to a super-soft, falling-off-the-bone meat. Absolute heaven. Presented on a chopping board adorned with leaves and with bottles of mustard, applesauce and lingon berry preserve, all you really have to do is carve.Serve this with some sliced ciabatta and a big bowl of arugula for guests to make their own yummy little porchetta sandwiches. You could throw in an Asian option with cuapao buns, some hoisin sauce and Sriracha, fresh cilantro leaves, spring onions and cucumber. I would serve this with a crisp, dry Riesling for a refreshing contrast to the rich pork. Contact A Table by Dulce Magat Gibb at 0917-862-1800.If you don’t even have time to go out and buy wine, you can order online at www.manilapremierewines.com and www.boozy.ph .Because it’s always nice to have something that you’ve made yourself, try serving a homemade caviar terrine, always a hit at my parties and incredibly easy to make!Recipe File: Caviar TerrineIngredients:225 grams plain cream cheese2 hardboiled eggs, cold or room temperature1 package of black lumpfish caviar1 small red onion, finely minced2 lemons1 bunch of fresh dillCrackers or Melba toasts for servingProcedure:In a food processor, whip together the cream cheese, hardboiled eggs and some fresh dill leaves. You may season with some ground black pepper if desired, but it’s not necessary. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and fold in the minced red onion. Assemble the pie using a ring mold, directly on the serving plate or on top of an appropriate-sized cake board. Place a layer of the cream cheese mixture, then top with a layer of the caviar. Cover and chill. Before serving, carefully remove the mold. Cut one of the lemons in half lengthwise and make thin, half-moon slices. Use these to garnish the sides of the caviar pie. Garnish with a large sprig of dill on top and serve with some lemon wedges and crackers or Melba toasts.For an even simpler version, use a nice glass or silver dish and make a caviar terrine instead by spreading the cream cheese mixture on the bottom, then topping with caviar, a lemon slice and dill garnish. That way guests can just dip their crackers directly into the bowl.",5 hassle-free holiday hosting ideas  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"On June 28, 2017, the Chinese Embassy donated more than 3,000 high-powered sniper and assault rifles to the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte says the guns will be used to fight against the terrorists in Mindanao, where martial law still reigns. The first batch of military equipment came in four cargo planes, worth an estimated ₱590 million, and were turned over to the Philippine government at Clark Airbase, Pampanga. President Duterte was quick to express his gratitude to the Chinese government for their aid against the ISIS-aligned militants currently besieging Marawi City.“To Ambassador Zhao, please relate our sincerest thanks to President Xi Jinping and the government of the People’s Republic of China for its military aid package I will receive today in behalf of the Philippine government,” he said. The Philippines’ commander-in-chief said this contract was “the dawn of a new era of Philippine-Chinese relations.” Duterte was, of course, referring to the several new business agreements between the Philippines and China. The Philippine head of state met with Chinese President Xi Jinping many times in the past. President Duterte said: “This not only strengthens our country’s commitment to support each other during times of need, but also highlights the dawn of a new era in Philippine-Chinese relations.” Your Excellency, Mr. President, I know you are fighting terrorism, ISIS-related terrorism in the south. China is also a victim of terrorism.” The ambassador added that a second batch of weapons will be sent to the Philippines within the coming months. Reportedly, over 71 government troops and 299 Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Marawi City. 246,000 citizens of Marawi have been displaced due to the conflict.Loading...So what can you say about this one?

She was arrested and detained on February 23, 2017, also for drug charges. Judge Juanita Guerrero ordered her arrest.The DOJ accused De Lima and Dera of conspiring to extort money from Peter Co, an inmate in Bilibid. Co claims in an affidavit that Dera blackmailed him by detaining and threatening his niece, Sally. Co claims Dera received 2 out of the 5 million pesos that he extorted from the inmate. Dera also allegedly took 4 of Co’s vehicles and used them during Sen. De Lima’s 2016 campaign. Co adds that Dera received 3 million pesos from Co’s niece, which he used to finance Sen.

"Steph Lagera is a professional model who is popular for being one of the A-Plus Paint Babes, a group of pretty female models brought together to better sell paint products.Blessed with a pretty face and seemingly glowing skin of a fairy, she managed to amass over a hundred thousand followers on Facebook alone. That number is bound to rise even higher as people share videos and download links of an alleged scandal of her throughout Filipino social media.Yes, unfortunately, this post is another one about scandals in Philippine social media scene. Anyway, being a group of good bloggers that we are, we started digging for the truth about this rising issue and found out that while the girl in the said video looks a lot like Ms. Lagera, we still have our doubts if it's actually her. So we did some lurking around her social media profiles to find out more. We did not find definitive proof that she is indeed the girl in the video doing stuff to the tune of a Queen song.My personal opinion is that the girl in the said video is more mestiza-looking than Steph but that won't stop you from searching for part 2, right? I must warn you though for the nth time that spreading such videos is illegal under the law so do what you gotta do at your own risk.According to Lagera herself, she does not have such videos going around the internet as you will learn on screenshot of her post below:Again I remind you our good readers that you must not share around, whether it's her or not, not only because it's a terrible thing to do but it is also punishable by law.",Alleged Steph Lagera scandal video and download link spreads online

Tilapia has been found to be even more disastrous for your health than some of the more notorious meats like beef and pork.Wild tilapia eat a delicious diet of algae and various plants, but most of the tilapia in the store doesn’t come from the wild – they come from factory farms, where tilapia are fed an unnatural, unhealthy diet of GMO corn and soy pellets.Why can't you eat farmed-raised Tilapia?Farm-raised tilapia has been shown to cause aggravation in the body like asthma, joint inflammation, coronary disease, and a host of other problems.Farmed fish contain ten times the normal amount of carcinogenic, or cancer causing agents as fish found in the wild. It’s no different for tilapia.These kind of fish also have a higher amounts of pesticides in them, as pesticides are used to treat the fish for infections while being farmed and often remains contained in their bodies after harvesting.Tilapia has high level of Dioxin, a lethal substance that, once in your system, can take up to a decade to leave your body. Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farmed fish than in wild fish.Did you know that chicken poop is one of the primary ingredients in ranch fish feed?Do you really want to eat chicken poop on your fish? Because if you buy it from the store, you basically are.So next time you’re at the store, it might be best for you to leave the tilapia on the shelf.",WARNING: This Is the Reason Why TILAPIA is Dangerous To Eat - Stop Eating Before Its Too Late!
"People paying a mortgage in Canada’s major cities aren’t the only ones feeling the heat from hot housing markets: many renters are struggling as well.Data released yesterday by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation shows the national average cost of rent is up and the national vacancy rate has plummeted.That’s forcing some renters in cities with ultra-low vacancy rates to consider whether the payoffs of living in a big city are worth the cost, both financially and in terms of quality of life.Sharna Ridge, 27, recently moved to Toronto from the United Kingdom on a two-year visa. She found a job within four days and a short-term sublet through a Facebook group.Ridge describes the search for a longer-term rental as horrific.‘Really what we are talking about today is people who are able to be fully employed, but are not able to afford housing. That is a whole new problem’ – Jennifer Keesmaat, former chief planner for Toronto“One room I looked at was covered in bird excrement,” Ridge said. “That was $800 a month and she wanted a caretaker for her bird as well.”Ridge has gone through all the options in her head, calculating what she can live without, how much above her maximum budget of $850 she can go, and at what point would she call it quits.“It would be devastating if I can’t find a place,” Ridge said. “I don’t want to go home because I’m homeless due to a housing crisis.”It’s getting worseCMHC estimates the vacancy rate — the number of rental options currently available on the market — in Toronto is 1.1 per cent this fall, the lowest in 16 years. In Vancouver, it’s 0.9 per cent.Average costs for all types of rental housing that the CMHC examined (bachelor, one bedroom, two bedroom and three or more bedrooms) hit $1,296 per month in Toronto, an increase of 4.5 per cent from the previous year. In Vancouver, average rents were up 5.9 per cent at $1,297, though a vacant one-bedroom condo can rent for in excess of $1,700 a month.Jim Murphy advocates for the rental industry in Ontario and stresses that more purpose built rental buildings are needed to keep up with demand. (Joe Fiorino/CBC)It’s not only the droves of people who come to Toronto each year that are putting stress on the supply of rentals; households are getting smaller as more people choose to be single, according to Jim Murphy, president and CEO of the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario.“It’s going to get worse over time as the population increases, as demand increases…We need more supply,” Murphy said. “We’re worried about those in the middle. Those millennials making $50-, $60-, $70,000 a year. Where are they going to live?”In some cases, the answer is in an entirely different city.Vancouver was home for 35-year-old Jessica Barrett for nearly 15 years, until she realized she couldn’t live the life she wanted as real estate prices and rental costs climbed out of reach.Jessica Barrett lived in Vancouver for almost 15 years but recently decided to leave because she was too burned out by the stresses of living in the increasingly unaffordable city. (Peter Evans/CBC)“I honestly was so burned out on every level,” said Barrett, “I would have [had] to keep freelancing, on the side, on top of a very demanding full-time job, just to make up the rent. And I was already at the end of my rope.”Barrett wrote columns about a city at risk of losing its young, vibrant professionals like her.“Are we really going to be OK with a city, or a society, in which anybody who has a young family, or is a teacher, or a social worker, or a journalist, or an artist, can’t afford to live there?” said Barrett.Barrett is moving to Calgary with her boyfriend in the coming weeks.Is Canada’s prosperity at stake?Columns such as Barrett’s, as well as other housing market horror stories, have put the national spotlight on a lack of affordable housing.The City of Toronto’s former chief planner, Jennifer Keesmaat, has urged governments to invest in affordable rentals.“It used to be that when we talked about affordable housing we actually worried about social housing,” said Keesmaat. “Really what we are talking about today is people who are able to be fully employed, but are not able to afford housing. That is a whole new problem.”Jennifer Keesmaat is the former chief planner for Toronto. She says that housing is becoming unattainable in the city. (Rob Krbavac/CBC)Keesmaat is optimistic the federal government’s recently announced 10-year, $40-billion national housing strategy may help. In particular, she’s hopeful the $15.9 billion co-investment fund could be used as a tool for building more affordable rentals.“It’s difficult to understate how significant it is that the federal government is recognizing there’s a federal role in housing,” Keesmaat said. “If there is an area where there needs to be more emphasis, it is on this question of how we expedite the provision of more affordable rental.”Otherwise, Keesmaat says, the situation could get even worse and threaten the stability of Canada’s overall economy.“I do not think it’s too strong to say that we are at a fundamental crossroads. And the prosperity that we see as a country and in our cities is at risk if we do not address housing affordability, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto,” Keesmaat said.Sticking it out no matter whatEven in the face of tightening vacancy rates in Toronto, some renters, such as Bibin Joseph, 24, are still optimistic.“I tell people the reason I want to move to Toronto [is] because it’s the New York of Canada,” Joseph said.Bibin Joseph recently moved from Edmonton to Toronto and he describes the house where he found a room to rent as ‘chaos.’ Still, Joseph is determined to find a new rental so he can stay in the city. (Rob Krbavac/CBC)So far though, he hasn’t been able to enjoy the city much. All he’s been doing is working and trying to find a place to rent. Currently he shares a crowded house with about nine other people. He’s a young professional in digital marketing, a skill that fits Toronto’s economic future, but he’s still struggling to find one of life’s most basic needs.“I miss Edmonton a lot more now, because I left a lot of comforts to come to a city where I’m struggling.”Still, Joseph is determined to stay.“I’ll never say I’ll move back to Edmonton because I feel like I lost in Toronto,” said Joseph. “I have this attitude — to never give up.”",Ultra-low rental vacancy rates highlight desperate struggle to find affordable housing  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"President Rodrigo Duterte revealed during his arrival statement following his state visits to Cambodia and Singapore that the woman that he saved from 3 kidnappers is now a Doctor.During a press conference in Davao International Airport on December 16, he explained why he must kill the criminals in Davao City during his early years as Mayor.According to him, kidnapping was rampant in Davao City during his early months and every Davaoños knew that.He narrated how he and his men saved the life of a woman who is now a doctor from her kidnappers.“I was only three months mayor in 1988. Alam ninyong taga-Davao. You know, all Davaoeños know that. They were picking victims right in the middle of the downtown area. Sa [uyangco?] rin dinampot nila yung babae kasama yung boyfriend. They were just into this…there used to be a Betamax, you have to go to an outlet and rent one. They just picked up the woman and brought her to Cotabato and they detained her for 2 months. One day, they sent feelers of… to the family and she’s still alive. She is now a doctor, the woman…sent feelers to the parents that they were going to surrender or return the hostage, I don’t want to mention the name. Sabi nila in exchange for 2 million not to tell the police but the parents whispered to me.So, on that fateful night, they were travelling. I was there with retired police Elson Estares and two others because they never expected that they would pass this way but they would return. It is not done. Usually if you pass in this area, you pass only once. You do not go back and…but the troops were there surrounding the house. So when we heard somebody inside, he’s a brave guy, Lima, he was the one I told. You go there because he was a shooter. I said could you take out three persons at one time, he said yes.When the firefight started and Duterte already knew that the criminals were ready to kill and to die, he grabbed his m16 to finish them off.Okay you will be that inside the bedroom. And when she said the birdie, “birdie” is safe. So they went down and it was covered by the televisions. The networks were just at the background. So, when they refused to stop, we saw a carbine pointed at us. We were parked nearby. So, the shooting started and I was one holding a…I was holding a .45 but you know, when I saw them coming back to our direction, I grabbed my M16, American-made, mind you…to kill criminals. Not extrajudicial, there was a firefight. And I said there were about only three of us there.He lambasted the people who criticized him for his admission that he killed criminals and told them that he’s only doing his job to protect the people of Davao.So, I might have hit them all or none at all. But the fact is I was there and I fired at them. It was a pure case of kidnapping. It happened during my first term in 1988. And here comes an idiot—always an idiot almost all of them are, saying that my admission, that I shot the suspect, they were not suspect. You idiotic. I don’t know from where you are. To us I was not a suspect, I was in a shootout and many others in my career of the 23 years. I am a mayor that cannot tolerate oppression of civilians, and many others and small encounters. Another kidnap-killing I was there. It also resulted in a shootout. The family was a…the wife of a small mall here in the city. So what’s wrong in being, you are pictured to be a killer.So, at least I killed to protect people. I am not here a dictator killing my political opponents to stay in power.”Duterte said that he only kill to protect the oppressed people of his city where criminality where rampant during the 1980’s before he became a Mayor.",Public Trending

"Willie Monroe Jr. of the US is checked by the referee after being knocked down in the first round by Gennady Golovkin from Kazakhstan during their Middleweight World Championship bout at the Forum Arena in Los Angeles, California on May 16, 2015. Golovkin won the fight by knocking out Monroe Jr. in the sixth round. AFP PHOTO / MARK RALSTON / AFP PHOTO / MARK RALSTONGennady Golovkin and Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez’s eagerly-anticipated bout will be watched by a global television audience, but it is not the only world middleweight title fight on Saturday.Billy Joe Saunders’ second defense of his World Boxing Organization belt against Willie Monroe Jr. in London will not attract the same attention or glamour but is nevertheless significant since the winner is likely to face the victor of Golovkin-Alvarez clash, which takes place a few hours later in Las Vegas.Golovkin, from Kazakhstan but based in California, defends the other three versions of the world title (World Boxing Council, World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation) against Mexico’s Alvarez in a clash between boxing’s biggest stars now that Floyd Mayweather Jr has gone back into retirement.For Saunders, there can be no more excuses about motivation after an inactive and frustrating reign as champion. The 28-year-old English boxer won the WBO belt from Ireland’s Andy Lee in December 2015 but due to injuries and postponements has only fought once since, an unimpressive points win over Artur Akavov at a leisure centre in Scotland in December.But Saunders (24 wins, 0 defeats, 12 KOs) feels rejuvenated and credits new trainer Dominic Ingle with improving his conditioning ahead of facing American Monroe (21 wins, 2 defeats, 6 KOs).‘Confidence boost’Great Britain’s Billy Joe Saunders (L) is declared winner after defeating Turkey’s Adem Kilicci during their 2008 Olympic Games Welterweight (69 kg) boxing bout on August 10, 2008 in Beijing. AFP PHOTO JACQUES DEMARTHON / AFP PHOTO / JACQUES DEMARTHON“You can say lack of motivation but when you’re in touching distance of something great, that alone gives me motivation,” Saunders told reporters on a conference call from his training base in Fuerteventura, one of the Spanish Canary Islands.“The way the Ingles go about their business is second to none. My fitness is on a different level. I’m fit enough now to fight 15 rounds, every minute of every round. That alone boosts my confidence by leaps and bounds.“I know what is around the corner, I want to test myself against one of the greats. Willie had his chance (against Golovkin in May, 2015). I want to beat Willie Monroe in a better way than Golovkin did.”Golovkin, 35, and Alvarez, 27, are recognised as the best middleweights in the division and Saunders thinks the champion will prevail this weekend.“I think it will be a very close fight but Canelo looks like he has overdone it in training, he looked fatigued in training and he’s overdone it,’ said Saunders, from Hertfordshire, northwest of London.Saunders’ promoter Frank Warren is confident his boxer will face the winner of Golovkin-Alvarez should he beat Monroe Jr.“If Bill comes through he will fight the winner of Canelo-Golovkin,” said Warren. “It’s all in his hands now. He knows what he gets out of this fight if he wins and I believe he will deliver.”– ‘Shot at redemption’ –Monroe, 30, is boxing for the first time in a year and has registered two points-wins since being stopped in six rounds by knockout specialist Golovkin.“He took a beating before and if he quit before when there were three belts on the line, he will certainly quit when there’s one belt on the line,” said Saunders.Monroe, from New York, refused to be drawn into trash talk but is hoping Golovkin beats Alvarez so he can have a re-match.“It’s a shot at redemption,” said Monroe. “I think Canelo is just going to win but I want Triple G (Golovkin) to win so I can get him back.“If you look at my fight with Golovkin and his fight against Kell Brook and Danny Jacobs, he doesn’t deal with fast fighters.“I’ve had a 12 week camp for Billy Joe, but I only got six weeks’ notice for Golovkin. I never had big backers and money guys in my corner to make things happen, so when a shot like that comes up you take it.”He added: “Billy Joe has had a great promoter like Frank Warren in his corner.

"An Edmonton MMA fighter who was left in critical condition after being knocked out during a boxing match on Friday has died, his family has confirmed.“It is with incredible sadness, sorrow and heartbreak to report that Tim has passed away today,” Hague’s sister, Jackie Neil said in a statement Sunday.“He was surrounded by family, listening to his favourite songs. We will miss him with so greatly.”Hague was taken to hospital in critical condition after being knocked out by Adam Braidwood in a fight at the Shaw Conference Centre on Friday. In a video from the match, Braidwood is seen knocking Hague down multiple times.Hague, who fights out of Edmonton, also fought in the UFC. His nickname was “The Thrashing Machine” and he was cut from the UFC roster in 2011.After his 2011 release, he wrote on his Facebook page that he needed time to heal from a concussion.“I’m gonna take a little break away from MMA, let the brain heal from my concussion, and get the passion/fire back.”Hague’s last fight before Friday’s bout was in early April against Jared Kilkenny. He lost by TKO (Technical Knock Out).Tim Hague is a Grade 4 English teacher at École Bellevue School in Beaumont. (École Bellevue School)‘He’s iconic’Hague trained at UFC Gym Sherwood Park at least six times a week, according to the gym’s owner, Alicia Landry. He usually stayed for two to three hours to lift weights and work on his conditioning.Though he boxed at another location, Hague offered one-on-one evening classes at Landry’s gym.“He was probably one of the most positive people I’ve ever met,” she said. “He was just happy to do whatever he could to help anybody — I’ve never seen him have a bad day.“If he saw somebody struggling with pads, he’d step in and volunteer his time to set them on the right path.”Hague — a Grade 4 English teacher at École Bellevue School in Beaumont, Alta. — had planned to lead a summertime sports camp at the gym. “The students just adored him,” Landry said. “He’s a big teddy bear, that guy.”Edmonton’s MMA community is still reeling from news of Friday’s fight, she added.“Locally, he’s iconic,” Landry said.“The MMA industry in Edmonton is very small and it’s very tight knit,” she said. “Everybody has each other’s backs, regardless of past issues.”",Edmonton MMA fighter dies after boxing ring injury  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Most common of these are water traps, spring loaded bombs and glass-encased cyanide capsules.Carved Stones and MarkingsAccording to treasure hunters, you'll know the right spot where the goods are buried depending on the markers you will see as you dig. Some markers points the exact location of the treasure while are placed in the site as a diversion to confuse treasure hunters.They also believe that these marker stones sometimes indicate what particular treasure is buried at the site.Treasure LocationsYamashita treasures are said to have been divided and buried in many different locations all over the country so as to make sure the allied forces will have a difficult time finding it.

"The U.S. State Department sounded enthusiastic, but fell short Friday of saying definitively whether the United States will send its athletes to compete at the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea.Tweeting that it looked “forward to cheering on @TeamUSA,” it also said it supported South Korea’s efforts to make sure that “a safe and successful winter games will take place.”It was the third time this week someone speaking for the Trump administration had come up just short of telling athletes and Olympic fans what they wanted to hear.Only minutes after walking away from the podium from her daily briefing on Thursday did White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders seem to realize her comments about the Games were producing “breaking news” headlines.The White House’s Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics, but backpedalled later with a tweet saying ‘no official decision has been made.’ (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)She quickly tweeted out an update that softened the impact of her comments.UPDATE: After saying “no official decision has been made” on whether U.S. athletes would participate in the Winter Olympics, Sarah Sanders says “the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea.” pic.twitter.com/QVGTEHdx95 — @NBCNewsHowever, that clarification too fell short of a firm commitment, and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had suggested on Fox News the night before that a final decision still hadn’t been made.Russia sanctioned for dopingWhile the U.S. equivocation is because of continued tensions between North Korea and the Trump administration, it came the same week Russia learned it’s been banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from sending a team at all. That’s the IOC’s penalty against Russia for not only knowing it sent dirty athletes to the Games in Sochi, but for co-ordinating the doping effort at its own labs.And for reasons connected neither to doping nor diplomacy, but worries over potential injury and insurance costs, the NHL has already announced its athletes won’t be going to South Korea.Just under two months before they even start, have these already become the Games with an asterisk?“I don’t think so,” says Montreal’s Dick Pound, the first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency and a current IOC member.He says that in contrast with the 1968 Games when East German athletes were rumoured to be cheating, but no one could prove it, the IOC had to act on what it learned about Russia at the 2014 Games in Sochi.“This is the outcome of the exposure of a very tawdry system of cheating in sport, basically in real time. We didn’t have to wait for the fall of the Berlin Wall to get the information. So, this is what you would expect for misbehaviour in sport,” he said in an interview for this week’s edition of The Investigators (Saturday at 9:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 5:30 p.m. ET on CBC News Network).Russian athletes who’ve never failed a drug test can still compete, but any medals they win won’t count toward a Russia total, nor will the Russian anthem be played.Pound says whether Russia will still try to find a way to cheat is a fair question given its history.“The tampering, if that’s what it would be, would be if they can slip in some athletes that have been doped.”North Korean leader Kim Jong-un guides the underwater test-fire of strategic submarine ballistic missile in this undated photo released by nation’s state news agency. (KCNA/Reuters)Past the deadlineYet even outside the spectre of the Games themselves is the continued military tension in the area. Pound believes beyond an actual military strike or direct attack, there’s no reason to move the Games to another country.“I don’t think you can allow yourself to get run off the hosting of an event of this character simply because there are some belligerents out there. North Korea is trying to show that it punches above its weight in the nuclear age, but they also understand that if they do anything … too far, they will be annihilated.”Having said that, he says the deadline to be able to move the Games has already passed.“There will be Games in Pyeongchang, or there will be no Games.

"Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) Chief Atty. Persida Acosta announced to the press that the suspect in the Bulacan Massacre will not get any help from their office. Atty. Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victim’s family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acosta’s statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12:“… to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.”No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accused’s guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:“(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.”The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Estrella and Aurora were found lifeless and naked in different parts of the house. The three children were then found inside a locked room also dead from stab wounds. They were found by Carlos, Estrella’s husband who just came home from his night duty as a security guard in a bank in Makati City.One of the three suspects surrendered himself to the authorities as his conscience was haunting him and he regretted the crime that he did. The suspect said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN “Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok,” .

"Three people have been arrested for allegedly throwing firebombs at a synagogue in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, the second anti-Jewish attack in the Nordic nation in two days. Jewish groups condemned the attacks as “unconscionable” and demanded that authorities take action.No one was injured in the attack late Saturday during a youth event at the synagogue and the adjacent Jewish centre in Sweden’s second-largest city. Gothenburg police spokesperson Peter Nordengard said Sunday it is being investigated as an attempted arson.The attack took place after some 200 people rallied late Friday in the southern city of Malmo, yelling anti-Jewish slogans and waving Palestinian flags to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Protesters demonstrate against U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, outside the U.S. Embassy in Berlin on Friday. (Axel Schmidt/Reuters)Witness Allan Stutzinsky told the TT news agency he saw a dozen masked youths who threw what appeared to be firebombs into the garden surrounding the synagogue in Gothenburg, but they failed to damage the building.Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and other top politicians condemned the incidents and authorities increased security around the synagogue and at Jewish centres in Stockholm and Malmo.“I’m terribly upset over the attack on a synagogue in Gothenburg yesterday and calls for violence against Jews at a demonstration in Malmo,” Lofven said Sunday. “There is no place for anti-Semitism in our Swedish society. The perpetrators will be held accountable.”He urged “all democratic forces” in Sweden to work together to create “a tolerant and open society where everyone feels safe.”‘Unequivocal response’ urgedOn Saturday, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted that those who called for Jews to be killed did something “totally unacceptable.”The European Jewish Congress said Sunday it was “unconscionable that Jews are under attack on the streets of Europe” and urged Swedish and other European governments to take “strong punitive action” against perpetrators.In Nordic neighbour Finland, national broadcaster Yle said police would raise security measures around the Helsinki synagogue.The American Jewish Committee, meanwhile, condemned a separate protest Friday in Berlin, during which American and Israeli flags were burned in front of the U.S. embassy.The director of the AJC’s Ramer Institute in Berlin, Deirdre Berger, called Sunday for an “unequivocal response” from German politicians, saying “the protests have to be condemned.”Berlin police said 10 people were detained and 12 criminal complaints were filed over the protest of Trump’s decision to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.","Synagogue firebombed in Sweden, 3 people arrested  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"U.S. President Donald Trump paid tribute Saturday to the leaders and foot soldiers of the civil rights movement whose sacrifices help make the United States a fairer and more just country, though protests surrounding his visit to Mississippi laid bare the stark divisions among Americans about his commitment to that legacy.As Trump gazed at an exhibit on Freedom Riders at the new Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, demonstrators near the site held up signs that said “Make America Civil Again” and “Lock Him Up.” Some shouted “No Trump, no hate, no KKK in the USA.”Trump spent about 30 minutes at the museums, gave a 10-minute speech to select guests inside and then flew back to his Florida estate, skipping the public schedule of the dedication ceremony held outside on a chilly day. He spent more time getting to Jackson than he did on the ground.It was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum & the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice & peace. pic.twitter.com/5AkgVpV8aa — @realDonaldTrumpTrump’s remarks steered clear of addressing the anger that his participation had sparked leading up to the dedication. In a deliberate voice and rarely diverting from his prepared words, the president sought to honour the famous and the anonymous for their efforts on behalf of freedom for all.“The civil rights museum records the oppression, cruelty and injustice inflicted on the African-American community, the fight to bring down Jim Crow and end segregation, to gain the right to vote and to achieve the sacred birthright of equality. And it’s big stuff. That’s big stuff,” he said.“Those are very big phrases, very big words. Here we memorialize the brave men and women who struggled to sacrifice and sacrifice so much so that others might live in freedom,” he said.The national president of the NAACP and the mayor of Mississippi’s capital city said they kept their distance from Trump because of his “pompous disregard” for the values embodied by the civil rights movement.Derrick Johnson, head of the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said at a news conference that they looked forward to a “grander opening” of the museum that they can attend.Johnson, a Mississippian, charged that Trump opposes labour rights, education, health care and voting rights for all Americans.“We will never cede the stage to an individual who will fight against us,” Johnson said. “We will not allow the history of those who sacrificed to be tarnished for political expediency.”‘Pompous disregard’Johnson and Lumumba spoke to about 100 supporters, including some who participated in the civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s, at Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center. Once the first public school built for African-Americans in Jackson, it’s now a museum to black history and culture.Protests greet Donald Trump at Mississippi Civil Rights Museum0:27Lumumba called Trump to task for “his pompous disregard for all of those factors that will not enable us to stand with him today.”One of the protesters, Laurie Bertram Roberts, told CBC News that Trump had “no place” at the event and that he has a “horrible record on civil rights, human rights.”She said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant should also have missed the event, after proclaiming April of this year to be Confederate Heritage Month in his state.The state’s attorney general, Jim Hood, criticized Bryant for inviting the U.S. president.“It threw cold water in the face of people who fought the battles for civil rights,” Hood said.Bryant, who introduced Trump, spoke of “the emotion that comes over you in waves as you see the past, the struggle, the conflict. I’m so very proud today that the president of the United States was here to see and witness it.”Museums ‘labours of love’Trump reflected on the past and hoped for a bright future, drawing on the achievements of civil rights veterans: “Today we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. We pray for inspiration from their example. We want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred and surrounded by love, opportunity and hope. Today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice and peace.”He called the museums “labours of love — love for Mississippi, love for your nation, love for God-given dignity written into every human soul. These buildings embody the hope that has lived in the hearts of every American for generations, the hope in a future that is more just and more free.”U.S. President Donald Trump greets Charles Evers, brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Trump was visiting the Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, Miss. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)Singled out by the president was Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP leader who was shot to death outside his home in 1963. His widow, Myrlie, was in the audience for Trump’s speech and drew a standing ovation when he acknowledged her.Trump said Medgar Evers “knew it was long past time for his nation to fulfil its founding promise to treat every citizen as an equal child of God.” Evers, Trump said, now rests in Arlington National Cemetery “beside men and women of all races, backgrounds and walks of life who’ve served and sacrificed for our country. Their headstones do not mark the colour of their skin but immortalize the courage of their deeds.”‘We are all Americans’Myrlie Evers did not mention Trump in her remarks a short time later at the public ceremony outside the museum. “Regardless of race, creed or colour, we are all Americans…. If Mississippi can rise to the occasion, then the rest of the country should be able to do the same thing,” she said.Among the high-profile figures to stay away was U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a leader of the civil rights movement. Lewis, who was among scores of Democratic lawmakers who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January to protest his record on race, said Trump’s presence at the museum opening was an insult.President Trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum.

"David Gorodyansky Contributor David Gorodyansky is the chief executive officer of AnchorFree.If you’re scared of a future America without net neutrality, I want to terrify you. The potential repeal of what should be a civic right should chill you to the bone. No, there is more than one future you should fear, and it isn’t just one that involves the (falsely reported) Portuguese internet where we pay $4.99 for access to streaming video. Don’t get me wrong – it’s totally possible, and not remotely the worst thing that could happen.After spending twelve years running a company that helps millions of people to break through the barriers of censorship imposed by oppressive governments, I am quite familiar with the ramifications of such repressions. When a country lacks an open internet, the government (and companies friendly with said government) are able to do anything from simply blocking or banning apps entirely (EG: Facebook, Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp for censorship or economic reasons) to more aggressive moves such as Egypt’s effective shutdown of their internet service providers.As a lucky American, it’s easy to say “this can’t happen here,” which is a reasonable, human gesture — we live under a democracy, but said democracy also has polarized politics and a totally different lobbying system to the rest of the world. While we have freedom of speech, we also have billions of for-profit lobbyist dollars acting as a cudgel against our interests.Out of the top 50 last year, the top 10 included AT&T, spending $16.3 million, and Comcast (the largest cable provider in America and owner of NBCUniversal) ranked 12th, spending $14.3 million. Verizon* spent $10 million, and T-Mobile $8 million. AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, the NCTA ($13.4 million in lobbying in 2016) spent over half a billion dollars looking to destroy net neutrality.What I want to establish is the hunger these companies have had for the destruction of your right to a neutral internet. America may not have a dictatorship, but it now, if net neutrality is repealed, will have an oligopoly. As Gizmodo has mapped out, net neutrality exists so that ISPs cannot legally “give preferential treatment to services they directly profit from and block those they don’t, all the while charging internet companies like Netflix additional fees for speedier access to consumers.”There will be a legal argument back and forth, there will be petitions, but if this is how the FCC wishes for things to be, it will stay. So I want to walk you through what potentially could happen to America.Things Get More ExpensiveAmericans already pay more than most countries for slower internet. Our internet providers, unlike recent changes made in the UK, don’t have to realistically advertise their internet speeds. So why would we believe that they’re going to be good to us?The classic (and short-sighted when one thinks truly profitably) argument is that we’ll be charged for service packages which split up gaming, streaming, and other things. The “unlimited” plan will definitely become part of our future, $20 more for “unlimited” access. What most don’t realize is it’s likely not to be a blockage but a deliberate slowdown of traffic to these services otherwise, giving people a taste of what they’re missing (or, should I say, what they had).Except we’re forgetting who owns many services that Americans enjoy. We may not be able to access Netflix on our “basic” plan at full speed, but we can of course access Hulu. Why? Because it’s owned by a corporate rat-king of Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Disney (which could soon own large parts of Fox) and Time Warner. Charter, owners of Time Warner, also own the ISPs Cox, Spectrum, CenturyLink, Road Runner and Frontier Communications. AT&T owns DirectTV, and wants to buy Time Warner.Those ISPs account for almost every single part of the American internet. Netflix and Comcast may have a deal with set-top boxes, but that doesn’t mean that Comcast can’t start charging extra for it under an internet that they can rig in their favor.The Brain DrainFinally, an internet that costs more to do less is simply less attractive to talent. The US already has restrictive immigration and a high cost of living – by making it a hostile environment for those that don’t appease the internet’s overlords, we’re rejecting the future geniuses of tomorrow. When Netflix, Spotify and Amazon came along, they were plucky startups that large corporations didn’t think would bother them until it was too late. Now they border on utilities, and though I’ve suggested even giant companies can be disrupted, smaller ones could easily be quashed immediately. It doesn’t take a grand leap of faith for Comcast to say a competitive product, or one that in some way threatens them (or one of their for-profit companies) isn’t “safe” to have on their ISP. Any company that threatens an entertainment product owned by NBC, or the voice or data services of AT&T, or begins to syphon talent from Time Warner’s HBO is at risk. Future startups that are particularly data-hungry could find themselves having to pay the toll to ISPs.Let’s take it one logical step further, and consider what Comcast could learn from your cloud storage provider. They could simply decide that anything coming from Amazon Web Services or Akamai — so most startups and companies – have to pay an overage per gigabyte to simply use their network.If you don’t think they will, they’ve already begun. Comcast created their own Content Delivery Network to speed up delivery specifically to Comcast customers. They disputed it being “faster.” But of course they would.These small steps amount to a powerful future fiefdom. The startups of tomorrow will become potential revenue streams for ISPs, either by creating preferential deals with cloud storage providers (raising costs across the board) or simply creating their own that gets there faster.Moreover, ISP can now keep an eye out for breakthrough online services (the Amazons and Spotifies of tomorrow) and throttle them into oblivion while simultaneously launching their own copycat versions of those services. If you think that Twitter’s treatment of Meerkat was unfair, you haven’t seen anything yet.The future is darker than you think. I urge you to realize that now, before it’s too late, and take action now. Talk to your friends, share this on social media, make your voice heard! Our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have set up a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to call your representatives in the U.S. Congress and tell them to stop FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s from rolling back the existing net neutrality protections.This and other similar initiatives are a great way to deliver the message to those who hope that you will stay silent until it’s too late to change anything. I hope we all will act as one now to stop this vicious all-out attack against our freedoms – the freedom of information, freedom of speech, freedom of enterprise, and freedom to choose what products and services to use.*Editors note: Verizon owns Oath, which owns TechCrunch.","This is the future if net neutrality is repealed; the creeping, costly death of media freedom  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"When the web was originally designed, its creators aspired to include a way to transfer value. According to the HTTP standard, error code 402 was “reserved for future use” and was labeled “Payment Required.”Just as we needed a way to freely share information, we needed a way to freely exchange value. Implementing a standardized payment protocol was a natural fit. But while data can live in a world where it’s easily reproduced, value inherently exists as the result of scarcity — in other words, the antithesis of the copy-and-paste nature of the information web.It quickly became evident that overcoming this challenge was no easy feat, and the idea was shelved indefinitely. While information could be exchanged in a decentralized fashion, there was no way to transfer value online without a central operator.That all changed in 2009 with the arrival of bitcoin, a medley of cryptography and peer-to-peer technology that elegantly solved this problem. From that vantage point, payment protocols like Bitcoin and Ripple — which allow us to transfer value online with each other directly — represent the continuation of the unfinished business of the web’s original founders.Consequently, there are numerous parallels between the birth of the information web and the developments we’re seeing now.It’s easy to take the Internet as it currently exists for granted. Its evolution from an esoteric network for researchers and hobbyists to today’s all-encompassing mainstream phenomenon was a long and arduous journey. It started with a classic chicken-and-egg problem: The Internet needed developers to build utility on it to attract users, but developers first needed users for whom to build.The early Internet was bootstrapped by academia and the military. Though the network was already open, global in scope, and quite powerful, there was little consumer utility. Instead, mainstream consumers used proprietary network solutions that were in vogue at the time. The likes of AOL (owner of TechCrunch) and CompuServe provided value-added services, from news to messaging to games.The only problem was that these pre-Internet networks didn’t interoperate. If you were on GEnie, there wasn’t a straightforward way to interact with your friends on AOL in the ‘80s. That’s not so different from how our payment networks currently operate, where systems like PayPal, Alipay and M-PESA aren’t yet federated.Two key developments unfolded in 1989: Tim Berners-Lee conceived the idea of the World Wide Web, and CompuServe became one of the first major online services to provide an email gateway, allowing its users to communicate via the Internet. These events marked the beginning of the federation phase of the Internet’s evolution. In both cases, standardized protocols allowed users to share information or communicate with each other directly, no matter what service, software, or hardware they used.",Public Trending
"One year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got eight provinces and all three territories to agree to put a price on pollution as part of a national climate change plan.The Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is a mouthful to say but it was considered by many to be the first time Canada had, at least on paper, an actual strategy to meet its international commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.‘It’s a huge agenda for 2018 because they’ve pushed them off.’ – Dale Marshall, Environmental DefenceTwelve months later, environmental advocates say 2018 is going to have to be a banner year for environmental legislation, regulation and strategies or the climate plan is going to end up on the scrap heap of climate promises past.At least six major environment policies, bills or strategies to implement parts of the framework are expected in 2018. That includes legislation to allow the federal government to impose a carbon price on provinces that don’t meet the federal standard on their own, a zero-emissions vehicle strategy, an overhaul of the environmental review and regulatory process, changes to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, regulations to force the phase out of coal-fired electricity by 2030, and a clean fuels strategy.Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, centre, talks as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left to right, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil, Prince Edward Island Premier Wade MacLauchlan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley look on during the closing press conference of the Meeting of First Ministers and National Indigenous Leaders in Ottawa on Dec. 9, 2016, where Trudeau and most of the premiers signed a historic pan-Canadian framework to fight climate change and meet the country’s 2030 emissions reduction targets. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)Plans to move forward on a national electricity grid are also possible in 2018, allowing provinces with an abundance of clean power to help out those that are trying to cut back on coal as a source of electricity.“It’s a huge agenda for 2018 because they’ve pushed them off,” said Dale Marshall, national program manager for Environmental Defence.Canada, which is trying to be seen as one of the big international leaders on the climate change file, is also going to want to have many of these things in hand before it hosts the G7 leaders’ summit in Quebec, where climate change is expected to be one of the biggest ticket items on the agenda.“We have made some good progress but we see potential risks into the new year,” said Erin Flanagan, director of federal policy for the Pembina Institute.The institute released Thursday a report card on the framework one year after its signing which gave the government three stars out of five for implementing carbon pricing and coal-electricity phase outs, but only two stars out of five for progress on the transportation sector, energy efficient buildings and the oil and gas sector — which together account for almost two-thirds of Canada’s total emissions.Numerous delaysFlanagan said the government has delayed methane emissions standards for the oil and gas sector from a 2018 start date to 2020, and is also behind on unveiling the details of the clean fuels standard that is to make the gas we burn in our cars a lot cleaner. While its full roll-out isn’t planned until 2019, the broad strokes of it were supposed to be made public this fall.We’re still waiting.Plans to spend $2 billion over two years on provincial and municipal-level climate change projects got spread over five years in this year’s budget. A competition for $600 million of that was supposed to be launched this fall.Again, we’re still waiting.An electric car plugs into a charging station in Toronto. Other federal climate change-related bills expected in 2018 include a zero-emissions vehicle strategy and a clean fuels strategy. (Oliver Walters/CBC)Flanagan said the hope was that the $10 per tonne carbon price would be in place at the start of 2018 but it’s now more likely to be delayed until the end of 2018.McKenna told The Canadian Press this week she feels “really good” about where the framework is at the one year mark.“We still have a lot of work to do to implement it but I think we’ve come a long way,” she said.Carbon price bill neededThe government did introduce the broad details of its federal carbon price last spring, though legislation is still needed to allow it to impose the price in provinces that don’t meet the federal standards.Neither Manitoba nor Saskatchewan have joined the climate framework but they did both release climate action plans this fall. McKenna praised them for at least recognizing climate change is real but she has also been clear neither plan meets the federal standards as they stand.A pump jack works at a well head on an oil and gas installation near Cremona, Alta. Most methane comes from leaks from oil and gas equipment like compressors, pumps and pipelines. The government has delayed methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)McKenna seem to intimate this week she’s hoping Saskatchewan will be more willing to negotiate once the governing Saskatchewan Party chooses a new leader at the end of January. Premier Brad Wall, the fiercest critic of the federal carbon pricing plan, resigned Thursday.“They’re in a leadership race right now but we hope they understand the need to work with us,” McKenna said.However, all of those running to replace Wall have stated their opposition to a carbon tax, which could be setting in motion a lengthy legal battle with that province.The federal plan calls for a price on carbon pollution of $10 per tonne in 2018, rising by $10 per year to $50 per tonne in 2022.Flanagan wants Canada to further commit to raising the carbon price to $130 a tonne by 2030.All countries, including Canada, are expected to raise their targets to cut emissions beyond current promises. The United Nations says existing commitments only get the world one-third of the way to keeping the planet from warming up so much that the impacts of climate change become uncontrollable.","Federal bills on carbon pricing, coal, clean fuels expected in 2018  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"Israeli airstrikes killed two Hamas members early Saturday following a rocket attack on Israel, in the latest fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, which has roiled the region and the larger Muslim world.The Israeli military said it targeted four Hamas facilities in response to rockets fired the previous day, including one that landed in the town of Sderot without causing casualties or major damage. The military said it struck military warehouses and weapons manufacturing sites, after which Hamas said it recovered the bodies of two of its men.Israel considers Hamas responsible for all rocket fire emanating from Gaza, which is home to other armed groups. Some residents of Sderot and other border towns spent the night in shelters, fearful of a resumption of rocket attacks from Gaza that have led to three Israel-Hamas wars over the past decade.Protests and demonstrations continued across the West Bank and Gaza on Saturday, the third and final so-called Palestinian “day of rage” following Trump’s announcement. The military said there were clashes in about 20 locations. In Bethlehem, Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli troops, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades.The Israeli military said about 600 Palestinians were throwing firebombs and rolling burning tires toward Israeli forces. It said it dispersed the crowds and arrested six rioters.Anti-Trump protests in West Bank, JerusalemAlong the border with the Gaza Strip, about 450 Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops at eight main locations. Around 20 were lightly wounded. Approximately 4,000 demonstrators gathered in Gaza City and demonstrations resumed in Pakistan, Turkey, and elsewhere across the Muslim world.In Jerusalem, police forces — some on horseback — scuffled with protesters near the Old City and arrested 13 people who were involved in what they called an illegal protest. Four policemen were slightly injured.“President Trump cannot take what he doesn’t have,” said Zuheir Dana, one of the protesters from East Jerusalem.An Israeli border police officer fires a tear gas grenade toward Palestinians during clashes at a protest near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah on Saturday. (Mohamad Torokman/Reuters)In a first, violence spilled into Israel itself, with Arab protesters blocking a major highway in the northern part of the country and hurling rocks at a bus and a motorcycle rider, injuring two.Israel has mobilized troops in case further violence breaks out. However, the clashes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have yet to claim lives or spiral into the level of violence some had feared following Trump’s move.Saturday saw a drop in the scope of the protests after clashes erupted Friday between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops in dozens of West Bank hotspots and along the Gaza border. Two Palestinians were shot dead in Gaza and dozens were wounded in the West Bank. In Jerusalem, people attending Friday prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site dispersed largely without incident. Large crowds of worshippers across the Muslim world staged anti-U.S. marches Friday, some stomping on posters of Trump or burning American flags.Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem, and his intention to move the U.S. Embassy there, triggered denunciations from around the world, with even close allies suggesting he had needlessly stirred more conflict in an already volatile region. The status of the city lies at the core of the Israeli-Palestinians conflict, and Trump’s move was widely perceived as siding with Israel. Even small crises over Jerusalem’s status have sparked deadly bloodshed in the past.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah movement and other groups have called for mass protests while its rival, the Gaza-based Islamic militant Hamas, is calling for a third violent uprising against Israel, though such appeals have largely fizzled as Palestinians have become disillusioned with their leaders.UN Security Council resistanceArab League chief Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, speaking Saturday at the start of an emergency meeting of Arab League foreign ministers, said Trump’s decision raises a question mark over Washington’s role as a peace mediator in the Middle East and beyond.“The decision amounts to the legalization of occupation,” said Aboul-Gheit, alluding to the occupation and later annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.Most countries around the world have not recognized Israel’s 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Under a longstanding international consensus, the fate of the city is to be determined in negotiations. The United States found itself isolated in the United Nations Security Council Friday, fielding criticism from its other 14 members over the proposed move.Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi said the council took a strong stance against “American violations of international law.”“They have no mandate to give away Jerusalem to an occupying power or to violate international law in such a blatant and egregious manner,” she said.While Trump’s announcement was warmly welcomed in Israel as an acknowledgement of its longtime seat of government and the ancient capital of the Jewish people, it was greeted with outrage from Palestinians who considered it a slap in the face and an abandonment of the longtime American role as mediator in the conflict.After two decades of halting peace negotiations that have failed to bring Palestinians closer to statehood, some in Abbas’ inner circle have begun to speak openly about abandoning the two-state formula in favour of a single binational state. In a sign of Palestinian frustration with the Americans, Abbas’ political adviser Majdi Khaldi said the Palestinian president will not meet with Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the region later this month.“The U.S. crossed the red line in its decision about Jerusalem,” he told The Associated Press.",Israeli strikes kill 2 Hamas men after Gaza rocket attack  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"Beating rhythmically and suspended in a jar, tiny heart-like structures made from stem cells are the latest innovation for drug testing — technology that has the potential to save pharmaceutical companies money. They’re developed by Canadian-backed biotech firm Novoheart Ltd., which hopes to revolutionize how drugs make it to market.The first thing people say when they see the tiny hearts in action company co-founder Kevin Costa says is, “Wow, it’s actually beating.… It’s actually working like a heart.”He says the Novoheart technology is different from other stem cell derived testing methods because of the three-dimensional structure of his company’s “Heart-in-a-jar.”“We can actually measure the hollow chamber that is pumping, so we can monitor how much pressure the organ is generating, like the blood pressure.”Novoheart co-founder and chief scientific officer Kevin Costa says the first thing people say when they see the tiny hearts is ‘Wow, it’s actually beating.… It’s actually working like a heart.’ (Jonathan Castell/CBC)“We can measure how fast it’s beating, like the heart rate,” he says.Technology like this has the potential to save pharma companies billions because the process of taking a drug through the discovery process is “lengthy and expensive,” Costa says. “It takes about a decade and a couple of billion dollars U.S. to take a drug from its initial concept to clinical trials.”Most drugs never make it past testing, often because they are toxic to the human heart. It’s a problem that’s difficult to uncover when testing on animals and can be left undiscovered until well into the human trial phase.A ‘miniature human heart’ created from stem cells beats on its own. Made for the drug industry, these hearts will be used to test the effects of news drugs on cardiac tissues.0:33This could help change that by weeding out drugs that will cause problems for human heart cells earlier in the process.“What we like to do is earlier in this process be able to test drugs — test compounds — in human heart muscle,” Costa says.Novoheart says it has pharmaceutical companies interested in its technology but securities regulations prevent the company from disclosing them until the proper paperwork is filed with the securities regulator.Novoheart biotech engineer Eugene Lee helps create the heart cells used to grow the tiny heart-like structures. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)Making the heart valves, Novoheart biotech engineer Eugene Lee says, is a multi-step process but “it starts with taking blood cells.”In the lab, blood cells are genetically reprogrammed into stem cells. Those are then manipulated into heart cells, which are placed by the millions into a mould.“The cells form a kind of Jell-O like solution,” says Lee “and over time will reorganize and hug or compact near the closest thing. And it’ll take the shape of the inner mould.”Millions of heart cells are placed into molds in the lab. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)‘A very topical’ industry segmentNovoheart was recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and has received financial backing from Canadian investors.“I think it’s a very topical and relevant industry segment,” says Darren Devine with CDM Capital Partners, which has a stake in the company. CDM invested in Novoheart because it believes companies like it can be disrupters to the pharmaceutical industry.In the stem cell industry, scaling up research into practical opportunities has been a problem, Devine says.“What investors are looking at now is how do you take this science experiment and turn it into a commercial opportunity?”To survive, he says companies need to prove they can get big, sustainable contracts from pharmaceutical companies that will have commercial value on a long-term basis.University of Toronto scientist Milica Radisic has developed a way to use heart tissues derived from stem cells for drug testing. (CBC)Novoheart is not alone when it comes to using stem cell derived tissue for drug testing.University of Toronto professor Milica Radisic has her own biotech startup TARA Biosystems and created something called a beating “heart on a chip” and says the possibilities are endless.“You can make tissue from anybody,” Radisic says, and using a person’s own stem cells can create heart cells for patients with certain diseases. “You can use them to build tissues and test drugs.”All of which may make it possible to test drugs on specific patients and essentially personalize drug testing.A strip of heart tissue beats on a slide at a University of Toronto lab. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)“Initially when we started on this I must say that pharma companies were sceptical,” she says.But things have changed: “Now the question we’re getting is, ‘What is your throughput? What is your turnaround time? If we send you something how fast can you turn it over?'”People outside the scientific community often find technology of the type that’s happening at Novoheart something of a head scratcher. But despite still being in the early stages and futuristic by nature, it’s something already getting attention from the global pharmaceutical industry.“One large pharma company may have one, maybe two drugs approved a year,” and Radisic says this technology should change that.“There is a huge need if you think of the diseases out there that are still not cured.”","Wow, its actually beating: Novoheart creates tiny heart-like structure with stem cells to test new drugs  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

If they can't find a different methodology to control the situation, he might declare martial law""He totally agreed with the President's decision to declare September 21 a holiday and have people rally on the streets, but warned them to not destroy or hurt people or vandalize.""The police are an instrument of the state; if they violate their sworn duty and go out of line, they have to be brought to court. And that's exactly what's going on""Enrile served as Defense Minister for 17 years and when asked about his thoughts in Marawi, he stated that the government would be lucky if they are able to control it in one year.He goes, "" ISIS is a worldwide problem, that's why I said the President has bigger problems than we encountered back then (during Marcos' time) the constabulary, which is now PNP, and the military were consolidated under one department, which was under me. Our problems were the MNLF, CPP-NPA, that's it.

"Sue Earl is still reeling from news that Sears has cut off her severance payments. She says she stands to lose upwards of $20,000.“I feel robbed,” says Earl, who did everything from work in the children’s department to handle catalogue orders during her 38-year career at Sears.“It’s another slap in the face,” adds the 64-year-old. “Especially when they reach out after you’ve left and snatch that money back from you.”‘We’re mad as hell.’ – Sue EarlEarl was laid off when the Sears store where she worked, in Cobourg, Ont., shut down in March — three months before the department store chain announced it would close 59 stores and lay off 2,900 staff as part of a court-supervised restructuring process. When those workers lose their jobs, they won’t receive severance or any extended medical and dental benefits.On the day it filed for bankruptcy protection, Sears also informed previously laid-off workers like Earl it was axing their severance payments and benefits.“We’re mad as hell,” says Earl, who has kept in touch will fellow ex-employees. “We’ve supported Sears with positive attitudes, and this is how we’re treated.”Pensions in perilEarl also fears losing thousands of dollars from her pension as part of the restructuring process. “I just feel helpless,” she says.A pension reduction is something the company’s 16,000 retirees are also worried about, along with losing their benefitsSears has a court hearing next week where the company will likely request permission to halt both its retiree benefit payments along with special payments it has made for some time to top up the underfunded pension fund.Joseph Moczulski, of St. Thomas, Ont., fears he could lose his Sears retiree benefits and a portion of his pension. (Joseph Moczulski )“We don’t have any rights under this court protection,” says Joseph Moczulski, who worked for Sears as a long-haul truck driver for more than 35 years before retiring in 2004.“It will be a hardship,” says the St. Thomas, Ont. resident of the possibility of losing his medical benefits. Both Moczulski and his wife are diabetics.“We were promised that from the company,” says the 73-year-old. “They don’t care about the years we put in.”Employees at back of lineSears Canada told CBC News that deep financial troubles left the iconic retailer with no choice but to seek court protection from its creditors while it restructures. As part of the court proceedings, Sears said it’s not able to make payments to a number of stakeholders, including laid-off employees owed severance.As far as retiree benefits and pensions are concerned, Sears contends it’s too early to predict what will happen and claims employee pension payments may not be compromised.The retailer also said ex-employees who feel they’re entitled to more compensation can make a claim as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.But for most, that could be a futile endeavor.It’s unlikely employees will recover their losses, says Toronto labour lawyer Lior Samfiru. That’s because when compensation is doled out in these situations, secured creditors like banks get priority.Sears Canada said that, as part of court proceedings, it is ‘not able to make payments to certain creditors, including severance payments.’ (Colleen Connors CBC)“Whenever a company is under creditor protection, employees are at the back of the line,” says Samfiru, with Samfiru Tumarkin LLP in Toronto. “If it yields something — and I highly doubt that it would — it would be small, small pennies on the dollar.”He adds that what the retailer is doing is perfectly legal. “It’s easy to demonize Sears here, but at the end of the day, Sears is acting in accordance with our bankruptcy laws.”‘Disgusting behaviour’While it’s following the letter of the law, Earl believes Sears cutting off payments to workers could hurt the department store’s image.“I think Sears is shooting themselves in the foot,” says the former employee.Even store customers have complained on the retailer’s Facebook page about the elimination of workers’ severance.“Canadians won’t stand for that. Just as well to close up all the stores when you take that stance,” posted one person.“Disgusting behaviour by a shell of a once great company,” commented another customer.Moczulski agrees Sears was a good company. “They’d do anything to keep us happy,” he says about working for the retailer. “You just wouldn’t believe how fantastic it was.”And that makes it all the more difficult for the retiree to witness Sears’ downfall, which could end up costing him as well.“I’m saddened about it, about how a company so great went downhill so fast,” he says.","Former Sears employees worry about lost severance, possible reduced pension  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"LIKE California wildfires razing everything in its path, scorching scandals have leaped from Hollywood to Washington, searing prominent members of the three branches of government from the White House to the Congress and the Supreme Court.Some former top aides of US President Donald Trump under investigation on security issues have pled guilty. A number of other officials, as also top TV and Hollywood personalities, have chosen to resign rather than engage in a full-blown fight over accusations of sexual misconduct.This willingness to resign, impliedly conceding a certain degree of guilt – and to give up a powerful position at a time when it is most needed – is the last option that a Filipino politician embroiled in a sex scandal is likely to take.It is “kapit-tuko” (clinging like a gecko) for most officials who have tasted the heady wine of power and wealth, whatever be the source(s) of these opioids.Filipino officials bursting with self-importance must think their American counterparts are made of marshmallow to concede so easily when cornered. The difference in their behavioral pattern may be a quirk of culture or character.The first impulse of the “smart” Pinoy is to deny whatever wrongdoing is being alleged against him, whether true or not, and look for the lusot (proof of innocence) later. The first impulse is to “deny to death.” If he cannot find a way out, he will build or buy one.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1• Franken a bad example for PinoysMINNESOTA Sen. Al Franken (D) said sorry after a radio talk show host accused him of forcibly kissing her in 2006 – two years before his election to the Senate – and for posing for a picture of him groping her breasts as she slept.Although he did not confess to any sexual crime in a carefully crafted statement, Franken announced Thursday he would resign soon – an act of total surrender that a Filipino politician caught in such a “minor” conflict will never consider.In da Pilipins, many powerful males are likely to gloss over sexual impropriety and may even flaunt it as a badge of machismo. Raising it to the next level, some officials regale their audiences with tales of their sexual prowess spiced with curses and off-color jokes.Pushing it to the hilt, some aberrant officials shamelessly finance their faux families with funds filched from public funds and, feeling confident, proceed to assign their mistresses official functions.A few polygamous officials seek legal cover by conveniently converting to Islam or claiming Muslim ancestry. Some lawmakers keeping multiple partners mollify their insecure mistresses by making a big show of pushing legislation for divorce or making annulment of marriage easier.The wanton disregard for morality and law – including the Commandment “Thou shalt not covet their neighbor’s wife” – helps deaden the public’s disapproval of immoral conduct, including officials’ tapping public funds and proceeds of corruption to finance their indiscretions.• Trump taped bragging of sex anticsPRESSURED by party mates in the US Senate, plus the surfacing of more women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Franken announced his resignation, but did not admit his guilt: “Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.”He took the occasion to hit back at high-profile Republicans – President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama – saying:“I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate, with the full support of his party.”A videotape that surfaced during the 2015 US presidential campaign, had Trump bragging about kissing and touching women. He dismissed his remarks as “locker room talk” for which he never apologized. At least 12 women accused him of past sexual advances and groping.Moore, 70, is running for the Senate in a special election in Alabama on Tuesday. He has been accused by several women of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers. He denied the accusations. Although party mates frown on his running, Trump supports him to firm up Republican hold on the Senate.Elsewhere, Democrat Rep. John Conyers, the longest serving congressman, resigned Tuesday also on accusations of sexual misconduct, although he has denied the allegations.• Cordial Duterte-CBCP ties seenTODAY being the Sunday after the Dec. 8 feast of the Immaculate Conception, we refer to The Manila Times column of Ricardo Saludo looking forward to improved relations between President Duterte and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines.Most people may not have noticed that a family friend of Duterte, Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles took over on Dec. 1 as CBCP president from Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas. The transition looked to us like Trump’s succeeding Barack Obama, a pet peeve of Duterte.Saludo suggested that both presidents consecrate the Philippines to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, an act that may help unite the nation and lead it to peace and prosperity. Such a transformation is possible if state and Church leaders work on it.The President’s daughter, Davao Mayor Sara Duterte, has consecrated the city to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.Saludo’s column also recalled many instances in history when Mary stepped into the affairs of men and nations to prevent or end conflicts and bring enemies together and uplift them.We highly recommend the reading today of Saludo’s column.* * *ADVISORY: All Postscripts from 1997 to the present can be accessed at manilamail.com.

"One of the problems of the country is the overpopulation in urban areas, and Sackur was able to identify that the family who can’t avail health services are the ones producing more offsprings. The Church condemns the government for promoting alternative family planning methods that would help these less privileged families to plan for their family.Sackur was able to pinpoint one of the root causes of poverty and that is overpopulation, which leads to underprivileged children, juvenile crimes and increase of juvenile delinquency and involvement in criminal acts and drug related incidents.Krizette Chu stated that Sackur was able to see the neglected side of the society, how real they are and how they lived, and Trillanes might not have seen any of these.

"A video showing a man being collared and slapped by a woman inside an MRT train has been making the rounds on social media Saturday, August 5, 2017. The person who posted the video said the man was a pervert who touched a female passenger. The apparent victim did not let it slip and confronted the perpetrator by ripping his shirt and introducing her palms to his face repeatedly.The woman can be seen trying to drag the man outside of the train presumably because she do not want to cause further inconvenience other commuters than her confrontation with the man already did. ""Lumabas ka"", she demanded repeatedly but the man won't oblige and said ""Pumasok ka na lang"". The woman had the way of it though after other passengers added their voice to hers threatening the man that they would push him outside if he would go on his own accord.The security guard eventually stepped in leaving the alleged pervert no choice but to step off the train.We condemn all violence against women especially those done in public but what made this video more interesting is the boy with the cap on. During the commotion, the sneaky little man saw the opportunity to make a living and took it. He fished something out of the pocket of the man that was being slapped by the woman. It was crazy! The perv fell victim to sneaky thief which makes him a perpetrator and a victim at the same time.

"FILE – In this Sept. 18, 2017, file photo, Miami Marlins’ Giancarlo Stanton runs the bases after hitting a three-run home run during the fourth inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets in Miami. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)MIAMI, Florida—After helping the New York Yankees to five World Series titles, Derek Jeter might help them win another.The Yankees and Jeter’s Miami Marlins have agreed to a trade that would send NL MVP Giancarlo Stanton to New York, pending a physical, a person familiar with the negotiations said Saturday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn’t announced the agreement.Second baseman Starlin Castro would go to Miami as part of the trade, a second person familiar with the negotiations said. A third person said the Marlins would also receive prospects Jorge Guzman, a right-hander, and Jose Devers, an infielder who is a cousin of Boston prospect Rafael Devers.The third person said the deal calls for the Marlins to send $30 million to the Yankees if Stanton doesn’t exercise his right to opt out of his contract and become a free agent after the 2020 season.Stanton has a no-trade clause in his record $325 million, 13-year contract and has indicated he will approve the trade, one of the people said. St. Louis and San Francisco said Friday that Stanton had vetoed deals to them.As for the physical, injuries curtailed Stanton’s season in four of the past six years, but he played a career-high 159 games in 2017 and led the majors with 59 homers and 132 RBIs.If the Yankees complete the trade with Jeter, their former captain and the new Marlins CEO, the Bronx Bombers would pair Stanton with Aaron Judge, who led the AL with 52 in his rookie season. That would give them a one-two punch to rival Ruth-Gehrig or Mantle-Maris, making for must-see batting practice.Judge sent a tweet to Stanton showing a clip from the movie “Step Brothers” with Will Ferrell saying, “Did we just become best friends?”Obtaining the 28-year-old Stanton would be reminiscent of the Yankees’ acquisition of AL MVP Alex Rodriguez from Texas after the 2003 season for second baseman Alfonso Soriano. Rodriguez signed a $275 million, 10-year contract after the 2007 season that ran through age 42; Stanton’s deal runs through age 38.An eight-year veteran with 267 home runs, Stanton has never played on a winning team and might now go to a club that hasn’t had a losing record since 1992. The Yankees reached Game 7 of the AL Championship Series this season in the first full year of a youth movement.New Yankees manager Aaron Boone, along with the front office, would have to sort where Stanton will play. He has played his whole big league career in right field, as has Judge. The Yankees also have the option of using one of them as a designated hitter.Stanton is owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract. The All-Star right fielder led the majors in homers and RBIs, but his salary will rise to $25 million in 2018.Jeter is expected to reduce payroll by at least 20 percent to $90 million or less. The Marlins shed $38 million of salary through 2020 by trading two-time All-Star second baseman Dee Gordon to the Seattle Mariners on Thursday for three prospects.Castro, who hit .300 with 16 home runs this year, could replace Gordon at second base — or might also be dealt by Miami because of his contract. He’s due $10 million in 2018 and $11 million in 2019 plus a $16 million club option for 2020 with a $1 million buyout.Gary Denbo, the Marlins new vice president of scouting and player development, spent the past eight years with New York and oversaw a farm system that ranks among the best in baseball. Guzman went 5-3 this year with a 2.30 ERA for Class A Staten Island. Devers, who just turned 18, batted .245 with 16 steals in 53 games for two teams in the low minors.More Marlins deals are possible at the winter meetings beginning Sunday in Lake Buena Vista; Castro and outfielders Christian Yelich and Marcell Ozuna possibly are on the trading block.The Yankees’ payroll for purposes of baseball’s luxury tax was about $209 million this year, and owner Hal Steinbrenner has vowed to reduce it below next year’s $197 million threshold, which would reset the team’s base tax rate from 50 percent to 20 percent in 2019. That would put the Yankees in better position for next offseason’s free agent class, which includes Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and possibly Clayton Kershaw.Stanton counts as $25 million for the luxury tax, but trading Castro cuts New York’s tax payroll by $8,801,786. Rodriguez ($27.5 million) comes off the payroll after this year, and five high-priced Yankees have become free agents: CC Sabathia ($20 million), Matt Holliday ($13 million), Michael Pineda ($7.4 million), Todd Frazier ($4,918,033) and Jaime Garcia ($4,961,721).New York could trade third baseman Chase Headley ($13 million), expendable because of prospects Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar. Outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who counts as $21,857,143, appears to be superfluous in an outfield that includes Stanton, Judge, Aaron Hicks and Brett Gardner. Ellsbury is owed $21,142, 857 in each of the next three years as part of a deal that includes a $21 million team option for 2021 with a $1 million buyout.After missing out on Japanese right-hander Shohei Ohtani, the Yankees are expected to seek starting pitching to bolster a rotation currently projected to include Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, Sonny Gray, Jordan Montgomery and Luis Cessa.Stanton would take a cut in take-home pay for his games in the Bronx. While Florida has no state income tax, New York State has an 8.82 percent top rate on income and New York City a 3.876 percent top rate. But he might make up the difference in new endorsements.",Yankees set to reel in MVP Stanton from Marlins  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has released his negotiating objectives ahead of talks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement next month, and several will pose problems for Canada at the bargaining table.In an 18-page summary released Monday, the USTR outlines how the U.S. will seek to eliminate NAFTA’s Chapter 19 dispute resolution panels. Canada uses these to appeal duties on things like softwood lumber, and the elimination of the panels was perceived as a potential red line for Canadian negotiators heading into the talks, expected to begin Aug. 17.American negotiators also want to exempt local and state governments from having to open up government contracts to Canadian and Mexican firms. That’s something Canada hoped to achieve in this negotiation, similar to how subnational procurement is opened up to foreign companies in Canada’s new trade deal with the European Union.Softwood lumber is not mentioned by the USTR, but a single line on page 14 will draw the immediate attention of Canadian negotiators.Canada is preparing to appeal punishing new anti-dumping and countervailing duties recently imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on Canadian imports, unless an agreement can be reached to settle this latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between the two countries.What the U.S. is now seeking would eliminate Canada’s ability to appeal this move to a NAFTA dispute panel. Canada could still appeal to the World Trade Organization, but winning in NAFTA arbitration is preferable to ensure duties are returned to Canadian producers, something a WTO win does not guarantee.“My initial take is a sense of relief, because what I see is traditional trade policy language using the existing rules of the road in ways that Canadian negotiators can deal with,” Laura Dawson, the director for the Canada Institute at the Wilson Centre, told CBC News Network’s Power & Politics.But eliminating Chapter 19 dispute panels “is a major red-line issue for Canada,” she said, pointing out it’s the same issue that almost brought down the Canada-U.S. free trade negotiations in the late ’80s.“We’ve seen this before, but it’s particularly painful for Canada when we are in the middle of a softwood lumber dispute,” she said. “That’s how we resolve dumping disputes. Without that, Canada’s really got its hands tied.”Trump told his followers on social media that ‘much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!’ He spent Sunday at the U.S. Women’s Open Golf tournament at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)While the U.S. is seeking to expand its ability to sell U.S. products and services to Canadian and Mexican governments, its proposal for fair and non-discriminatory government procurement appears to be limited to certain federal contracting.The objective is to exclude sub-federal governments from any commitments that are negotiated. Domestic purchasing preferences would continue to be allowed in U.S. states and cities, including preferences for small businesses, women, minorities, veterans and other “distressed areas.”“Buy America” requirements are also meant to be exempt, as is procurement by the U.S. Defence Department.Dairy language ‘nothing new’Other language in the report was anticipated, if not altogether friendly to Canada.The section on agricultural goods does not explicitly target Canada’s supply management system for dairy, poultry and eggs, but the Trump administration is seeking to eliminate non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports, including “restrictive administration of tariff-rate quotas, other unjustified measures that unfairly limit access to markets to U.S. goods, such as cross subsidization, price discrimination and price undercutting.”In a statement issued swiftly following the release of Lighthizer’s objectives, Dairy Farmers of Canada spokesperson Ashlee Smith said that the American objectives remain “fairly broad, and there isn’t anything new.”The dairy farmers believe that the U.S. is only looking for new access to Canada’s market because it has a problem with overproduction inside its own borders.Morneau on NAFTA negotiations1:08Dairy wasn’t part of the first NAFTA agreement, Smith’s statement pointed out, and the dairy group has told the Canadian government it sees “no valid new evidence to support that dairy be discussed in this round of discussions.” Canada’s trade balance on dairy products is in the Americans’ favour.The American dairy industry’s lobbying has more recently focused on asking the Trump administration to challenge Canada’s dairy policies, particularly its new pricing strategy for dairy ingredients, at the World Trade Organization.The USTR’s advisory council advised against pursuing the dismantling of supply management with Canada, fearing it could bog down the talks.Call to raise duty-free limitOnline cross-border shoppers may be most excited to read the USTR’s objective to improve customs facilitation, including raising the de minimis shipment value — the amount that can be shipped into Canada or Mexico duty-free — to $800 US.Canada currently triggers duties for goods valued over $20, one of the lowest de minimis levels in the developed world.On the first page of Lighthizer’s summary, the USTR continues to say that the administration’s goal is to “improve the U.S. trade balance and reduce the trade deficit with NAFTA countries.”For the first time USTR has included deficit reduction as a specific objective for the #NAFTA negotiations. https://t.co/RMS134T42Z — @USTradeRepCanada’s trade with the U.S. is not significantly out of balance, but the Americans had a trade deficit with Mexico of over $60 billion in 2016, according to USTR figures.Trade balances are not typically the focus of modern trade negotiations. Usually, parties to a negotiation focus instead on reciprocity: equivalent gains and sacrifices across all sides, with the hope of mutual wins overall.At a “Made in America” event at the White House Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump borrowed a phrase from former president Theodore Roosevelt, saying trade reciprocity is “the handmaiden of protection,” harkening back to a time in the previous century when preferential tariff treatment was used to promote political goals.In a statement, Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland welcomed the opportunity to modernize NAFTA and invited all Canadians to share their ideas and priorities through the government’s consultation process, which ends Tuesday.Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall told reporters at the premiers’ annual summer meetings in Edmonton that Canada’s trade negotiators should quietly prepare a list of ways to retaliate if the talks “go off the rail.”“I think it would be wise to have that ready sooner rather than later,” he said. “I don’t think we’ll need it.”",Elimination of dispute panels among U.S. NAFTA priorities that could put heat on Canada  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Fans then dug deep into it and apparently found out that the two broke up over a third party - allegedly the popular and admittedly yummy twerker, peddler of caps and vapes, and R-Breezy babe Toni Fowler.Since the news broke out, Jon King Badger, now called by some as King Fuccer, deactivated his Facebook account while photos of them together posted on Jelai Andres' account went unavailable.Meanwhile, Fowler whom many of the male populace of the internet believe to have much bigger bosom and far more superior skills than Andres, remained mum on the issue. Until today. Well, she did not actually spoke about the issue her name is being dragged in, but people of the interwebs firmly believe not only that the person in the photos are indeed Toni Fowler but also that her slashing her wrist was because of the issue.Well, as we have always said about every other dramas on social media in the past: see for yourselves and you be the judge.

"In the subtle world of diplomacy, sometimes the smallest thing can evoke a larger sense of significance. One such incident occurred on Wednesday night at a dinner table in the Laotian capital, Vientiane. Gathered there for the meal were the heads of state or cabinet representatives of 19 nations. It was the last hoorah before delegates to the (Asean and Related) summits concluded their business the following day.The thing was the seating arrangements; and had those involved any other than the three statesmen they did involve, they would have meant nothing. Let’s wind back a few hours.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had fired a less-than-diplomatic broadside at US President, Barack Obama (whether this was ill-advised, or not, has been thrashed out in the media around the world ever since, so we won’t be adding to that here). But the upshot of that furore was that for the purposes of diplomatic etiquette – and maybe in some minds to avoid the meal turning into a food fight – it was decided that the original seating plan, in which the two presidents were to have been placed next to each other, should be hastily revised. Of course, that makes sense. At that point neither would feel comfortable asking the other to “please pass the salt”.The thing was the new seating plan. In this, Obama found himself sandwiched between Brunei’s King Hassanal Bolkiah and Vietnam’s Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc – esteemed gentlemen, no doubt, though their nations right now figure much less than the Philippines in Washington’s calculations.Further down the table, Duterte settled into a seat next to Indonesian President, Joko Widodo – with whom he has much to discuss, and did the following night when he arrived in Jakarta for a two-day working visit. Meanwhile, on his right side sat Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation – who had a great deal to talk to Duterte about, and did at a private one-on-one get-together the following day. What transpired during Duterte’s Indonesia trip, The Volatilian™ will be looking at in a later article. As far as what was discussed between Duterte and Medvedev, over dinner and privately, we can only guess, but Russia’s ambitions to increase its sphere of influence in Southeast Asia might have been in there somewhere.Obama may not have wanted to be seated next to Duterte at the dinner, given what had transpired between them, but you can guarantee that the last person he wanted Duterte breaking bread with was Russia’s Medvedev.Whether Russian aides used their not inconsiderable skills in realigning the chess board for the dinner seating, we have no way of knowing. We’re fairly certain, though, that those new dining arrangements didn’t come about by accident. For Russia, the optics alone, amounted to a diplomatic coup. This seems to be more than symbolism; it’s starting to look prophetic.The Russian Federation has been quick to capitalise on the perception of reserve that Duterte has been exhibiting towards his country’s former proprietor. Washington’s implied notion that the Philippines is America’s 51st state and that their “special relationship” is inviolable, has worn thin with the present administration in Manila. (The Volatilian™ article of 26 August, Moscow’s overtures to Manila, attempts to put this into context).Furthermore, the current administration is not convinced – unlike its predecessor – by the constant US assertions that in some way Philippine security (more specifically its sea borders) is better under US protection. Better than what? An entente cordiale between Manila and Beijing? That would certainly get the Obama team reaching for the methaqualone. Or worse, Heavens! Some form of Protection Agreement crafted in the Kremlin, with Lord alone knows what devils lurking in its detail?Moves in either of those directions would virtually put Washington’s geopolitical plans in check in this region – it would certainly stall them – along with its plans for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade pact signed by 12 Pacific Rim countries. Interestingly, China, Russia and the Philippines which all have Pacific coastlines, are not TPP signatories.",Obama has to sit out Russian waltz
"MANILA, Philippines - Sen. Leila de Lima collected 1 billions from high-profile inmates in New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City when she was still justice secretary in the previous administration.This was the common allegation raised by several inmates in their affidavits submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Drug and robbery convict Herbert Colangco revealed that the Carcel Side, a coalition of gangs of inmates from the Visayas and Mindanao which he leads, had given De Lima P3 million per month.Carcel is one of the two factions of inmates in the national penitentiary with over 7,000 members belonging to the Oxo Allied Group. The other is the Presidio Side led by drug convict Jaybee Sebastian with over 5,000 inmates, mostly from Luzon.In a four-page affidavit obtained by The STAR, Colangco explained that the amount was for “payola” to then DOJ secretary De Lima “para sa pribilehiyo sa amin at para maipagpatuloy din ang mga negosyo sa Bilibid (for privileges accorded to us and also for our businesses inside the NBP to continue).”“Sa tantiya ko po, ang umiikot na halaga ng droga sa loob ng Bilibid sa pagpayag ni secretary De Lima bago pa kami ilipat sa NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) ay hindi bababa sa limampung milyong piso kada buwan (By my estimate, the amount of illegal drug trade inside the NBP upon permission of secretary De Lima before we were transferred to NBI would not be lower than P50 million per month),” bared the self-styled musician who even managed to produce music videos inside the penitentiary.Apart from illegal drug trade, Colangco confessed that he also ventured into selling beer inside the NBP during De Lima’s time. He said he was allowed to sell beer in can to thousands of inmates during events at NBP for more than 10 times the original price per can and would earn P3 million for 300 boxes.“Ang share ni secretary De Lima sa pag-aapruba sa pagpasok nito ay P1 million. Ito po ay dinadala ng tao kong si Rey sa DOJ o kinukuha ng tao ni secretary De Lima na si Joenel Sanchez (kasama sa security ni De Lima) at ng kanyang boyfriend na si Ronnie Dayan (secretary De Lima’s share for approving the entry of beer was P1 million.It was either delivered by my courier Rey to DOJ or picked up by secretary De Lima’s security aide Joenel Sanchez and her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan),” Colangco further alleged in his notarized affidavit.Colangco, head of the notorious Ozamiz robbery gang, recalled that when he and other high-profile inmates were transferred to the NBI in 2014, Sebastian then had a monopoly of illegal drug trade and other illicit activities inside the NBP.“Ang hindi susunod sa kanyang gusto ay tinatakot na ipapatapon. Naniniwala ang mga tao sa loob ng Bilibid na pwedeng gawin ito sa kanila ni Jaybee Sebastian dahil alam nila ito ay malapit kay secretary De Lima lalo na sa boyfriend nito na si Ronnie Dayan (Those who will defy him were warned to be thrown away.People in the NBP believe that he is capable of doing that because he is known to be close with secretary De Lima, especially with her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan),” he added in the sworn statement signed last Sept. 1. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has confirmed that Colangco, fellow drug convict Noel Martinez and about 10 other inmates would testify before the House of Representatives inquiry on the proliferation of illegal drugs in the NBP. He revealed that eight of them have been transferred to the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) custody for fear of their lives inside the national penitentiary in Muntinlupa City. Aguirre said some of the witnesses have bared in separate affidavits that they have collected money from illegal drugs since 2013 to support the senatorial bid of then secretary De Lima.The DOJ chief hinted that there is also a witness who delivered P5 million to De Lima’s house in Parañaque City, which was allegedly personally received by the senator and Dayan. Aguirre added that they also received information that De Lima, wearing a disguise, visited the NBP eight times and would go directly to the “kubol” of Sebastian.He said a letter from Sebastian would be submitted to the House on this matter. Aguirre earlier alleged that secretary De Lima brought out “coached witness” Edgar Matobato, who claimed to be a former member of the Davao death squad, in a desperate move to preempt the “explosive” testimonies and evidence to be presented against her in the House probe that will start on Tuesday.",Public Trending

"A collapsed home is seen after it was hit by a powerful earthquake in Juchitan, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Sept. 8, 2017. This was the most powerful earthquake to hit Mexico in one hundred years. (Photo by FELIX MARQUEZ / AP)JUCHITAN, Mexico — One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in Mexico and a raging hurricane dealt a devastating one-two punch to the country, killing at least 61 people as workers scrambled to respond to the twin national emergencies.The 8.1 quake off the southern Pacific coast just before midnight Thursday toppled hundreds of buildings in several states. Hardest-hit was Juchitan, Oaxaca, where 36 people died and a third of the city’s homes collapsed or were otherwise rendered uninhabitable, President Enrique Peña Nieto said late Friday in an interview with the Televisa news network.In downtown Juchitan, the remains of brick walls and clay tile roofs cluttered streets as families dragged mattresses onto sidewalks to spend a second anxious night sleeping outdoors. Some were newly homeless, while others feared further aftershocks could topple their cracked adobe dwellings.“We are all collapsed, our homes and our people,” said Rosa Elba Ortiz Santiago, 43, who sat with her teenage son and more than a dozen neighbors on an assortment of chairs. “We are used to earthquakes, but not of this magnitude.”Even as she spoke, across the country, Hurricane Katia was roaring onshore north of Tecolutla in Veracruz state, pelting the region with intense rains and winds.The US National Hurricane Center reported Katia’s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 120 kph (75 mph), making it a Category 1 storm when it made landfall. And it rapidly weakened even further over land into a tropical storm. The center said Katia now is stalling over Mexico’s Sierra Madre mountains and the maximum sustained winds are now down to near 65 kph (40 mph). It was expected to continue to dissipate over the course of Saturday.But the storm could still bring life-threatening floods and a storm surge off the Gulf of Mexico, though the extent of Katia’s impact was unclear in the dark of night.Peña Nieto announced that the earthquake killed 45 people in Oaxaca state, 12 in Chiapas and 4 in Tabasco, and he declared three days of national mourning. The toll included 36 dead in Juchitan, located on the narrow waist of Oaxaca known as the Isthmus, where a hospital and about half the city hall also collapsed into rubble.Next to Ortiz, 47-year-old Jose Alberto Martinez said he and family members have long been accustomed to earthquakes. So when the ground started moving, at first they simply waited a bit for it to stop — until objects began falling and they bolted for the street.“We felt like the house was coming down on top of us,” Martinez said, accompanied by his wife, son and mother-in-law.Now, he didn’t feel safe going back inside until the home is inspected. Right next door an older building had crumbled into a pile of rough timbers, brick and stucco, while little remained of a white church on the corner.Rescuers searched for survivors Friday with sniffer dogs and used heavy machinery at the main square to pull rubble away from city hall, where a missing municipal police officer was believed to be inside.The city’s civil defense coordinator, Jose Antonio Marin Lopez, said similar searches had been going on all over the area since the previous night.Teams found bodies in the rubble, but the highlight was pulling four people, including two children, alive from the completely collapsed Hotel Del Rio where one woman died.“The priority continues to be the people,” Marin said.Peña Nieto said authorities were working to re-establish the supply of water and food and provide medical attention to those who need it. He vowed the government would help rebuild.“The power of this earthquake was devastating, but we are certain that the power of unity, the power of solidarity and the power of shared responsibility will be greater,” Peña Nieto said.Power was cut at least briefly to more than 1.8 million people, and authorities closed schools in at least 11 states to check them for safety.The Interior Department reported that 428 homes were destroyed and 1,700 were damaged in Chiapas alone.“Homes made of clay tiles and wood collapsed,” said Nataniel Hernandez, a human rights worker living in Tonala, Chiapas, who worried that inclement weather threatened to bring more structures down.“Right now it is raining very hard in Tonala, and with the rains it gets much more complicated because the homes were left very weak, with cracks,” Hernandez said by phone.The earthquake also jolted the Mexican capital, which largely lies atop a former lakebed where the soil is known to amplify seismic waves. Memories are still fresh for many of a catastrophic quake that killed thousands and devastated large parts of the city in 1985.The latest earthquake swayed buildings and monuments in the capital more than 1,000 kilometers (650 miles) from the epicenter.Mexico City escaped major damage, though part of a bridge on a highway being built to the site of a planned new international airport collapsed due to the earthquake, local media reported.The quake’s power was equal to Mexico’s strongest in the past century, and it was slightly stronger than the 1985 quake, the US Geological Survey said.However its impact was blunted somewhat by the fact that it struck some 160 kilometers (100 miles) offshore.The epicenter was in a seismic hotspot in the Pacific where one tectonic plate dives under another. These subduction zones are responsible for producing some of the biggest quakes in history, including the 2011 Fukushima disaster and the 2004 Sumatra quake that spawned a deadly tsunami.The quake triggered tsunami warnings and some high waves, but there was no major damage from the sea. Authorities briefly evacuated a few residents of coastal Tonala and Puerto Madero because of the warning.In Veracruz, tourists abandoned coastal hotels as winds and rains picked up ahead of Hurricane Katia’s landfall. Workers set up emergency shelters and residents were urged to avoid going outside or crossing flooded rivers.“The arrival of (hashtag)Katia may be particularly dangerous for slopes affected by the earthquake. Avoid these areas,” Peña Nieto tweeted.","Deadly quake, Hurricane Katia a one-two punch for Mexico  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"A rock star to underwater photographers, Anilao shootout judge David Doubilet reveals a life made peaceful by diving and shaped early in a lake in upstate New York, when he was an asthmatic boy of eight.National Geographic photographer David Doubilet waited 40 years to shoot his dream picture: a clownfish. A male clownfish that was aerating its eggs just before they hatched in the waters of Anilao, Batangas.That was eight years ago and it almost didn’t happen. David was literally on the way to the airport with his wife Jennifer Hayes, a marine biologist, when photographer Gutsy Tuason called him up and told him he was going to Anilao.“Jennifer told me, ‘Get out and see Gutsy,” David says.And a magazine cover was made.One of the questions underwater photographers are always asked — especially those who shoot macro or species the size of your fingernail — is about the wait.Lifestyle Feature – Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1“People ask me, how long did it take you to make that picture? I say 40 years,” he says.Last week, David and Gutsy — both authors and award-winning underwater photographers — were back in Anilao, home to the rarest species in the world and a famous dive town three hours from Manila. They joined other judges of the 5th Anilao Underwater Shootout, organized by the Department of Tourism and Philippine Airlines. (PAL is giving extra luggage allowance to divers on their domestic flights in the Philippines.)Dubbed the World Cup of Photo Competitions, the Anilao Underwater Shootout brought together 173 divers and underwater photographers from all over Asia, Europe and North America to compete in Open and Compact Classes with five different categories (macro/supermacro, marine behavior, nudibranch, fish portrait and cephalopod).Among underwater photographers, David Doubilet is a legend. Many of them grew up seeing his photos in the pages of National Geographic. He’s a rock star to divers and underwater photographers.When we sit down for an interview, David reveals a life made peaceful by diving and shaped early in a lake in upstate New York, when he was an asthmatic boy of eight.Excerpts:THE PHILIPPINE STAR: Which came first for you, diving or photography?DAVID DOUBILET: It started all about the same time. I was snorkeling earlier and at 12, I started diving and taking pictures.Where was this?In New Jersey, but my first dive was in a lake in upstate New York in the Adirondack Mountains, not far from where we live now. I went to summer camp and didn’t like it very much. I didn’t like the mountains, I didn’t like the horses or baseball. The counselors gave me a mask and told me to clean out the dock of branches and trees in the lake. And my life changed. Eight years old.What did you see underwater?I can still remember, there were sunfish and other freshwater fish. It was great. We had a summer home in New Jersey and I started diving there. Things were pretty simple, it was the mid ‘50s. We didn’t have wetsuits until about 1960. Back then you made them yourself.How did your career with National Geographic start?I came to Geographic when I was still in university, in my second year at Boston University. I had just won a big international competition in Italy, Mondo Sommerso Prize. I had a friend working for Geographic and went to see the director of photography. He told me they had nothing for me but to come back next year. So I started to work on other kinds of photography. I was shooting with fairly primitive equipment — compared to what we have now — but back then it was pretty sophisticated. I shot a lot of black and white and I learned how to print. That was sort of the basis, the bones of how to see underwater, how to shoot pictures.What has diving taught you about life?That’s a very good question. What divers have, unlike the rest of the world — except for astronauts and mountaineers to a certain extent — is the ability to have a perspective of the rest of the planet. You go underwater and you come up out of the water and you see the planet in a whole new, complex light.Diving teaches you, to a certain extent, about trying to be calm. The biggest enemy of diving is over-exertion. You have to be as calm as you possibly can. Even free divers have to be calm no matter how hard they’re working; they have to remain at a simple, single level of strength. It’s also a great escape. You leave this planet through another place. Not a lot of divers do, but I tend to think a lot underwater.About what?Everything. Especially when I’m shooting, I get very intense, I get very direct. Both Jennifer and I will go to a reef system and we’re very direct in our approach. That’s what you see in this competition in Anilao. People are very intense and literally focused. They are so excited about what they’re doing — and what they’re doing is making art. But it’s an art that involves some of the smallest and arcane parts of the ocean. And yet when they bring it back up, it opens people’s eyes. The competition does a lot of things in terms of self-fulfillment, but it also tells people what the ocean is about.Is there a different kind of satisfaction between photographing critters and bigger species?Some people live and die for the smaller creatures. I like them very much, but I like a lot of different things under the water. I’ll be photographing very small things, but also shipwrecks, aircraft, larger things. A ship that ran aground in Malapascua, right next to where the thresher shark reef is, nearly wiped it out and that would have caused the jobs of 5,000 people. The thresher sharks would have just gone away.Anilao is one of the success stories in the Philippines. Decades ago fishermen were doing dynamite and cyanide fishing, but the NGOs managed to convince them that there’s more money in tourism especially when it involves diving.These guides whom everyone depends on, they work very hard and they’re geniuses. If they were fishermen they would just bang their heads against the wall and come up with almost nothing and families would be in trouble. Diving tourists coming here bring five times, six times the amount of money than somebody coming here to play golf or people backpacking or whatever. Diving is a labor-intensive business.The marine-protected areas around the Philippines are very successful because you have a no-take zone which will in time supply the take zone, and that will increase the number of fish that people can take out of the water. That’s working in many places in the Philippines like Apo Island.So there’s a tourism angle and the fact that people should be well aware of how important the ocean is to the average Filipino. This is a coral nation. No one lives more than 75 miles from the ocean.Do you have a favorite dive site?The next one.Have you been in a dangerous situation underwater?Oh, sure. Well, the most dangerous that Jennifer and I get into are situations that photographers tend to get into. And it’s based upon photographic greed — one more picture, one more story, spend some more time underwater — and all of a sudden you’re pushing your time. There’s always currents and weather that change.I’ve had experiences with all sorts of sharks. Jennifer and I work back to back so we see 360 degrees and we shoot like that. Obviously white sharks are difficult to work with outside a cage because for the most part you see many shark species and you bring them a little bait.We’ve photographed tiger sharks feeding on the remains of a dead sperm whale in the Great Barrier Reef, and then more and more sharks came in because of the oil from the sperm whale’s flesh. It’s a delicious smell for the sharks; they love the smell of turtles and marine mammals, and so they got very aggressive with us.I think the most dangerous thing we’ve done is not in the ocean at all but working on the Okavango Delta in Botswana. There were all sorts of crocodiles and hippos. Every dive, even at night, which was a crazy thing to do there, you could see the crocodiles’ eyes as they came closer and then we’d get out of the water. It was frightening.What was the longest time you’ve had to wait to photograph a certain species?It took me 40 years to get a picture of a clownfish and it happened here in Anilao. I was blown away.What for you is the most beautiful species in the sea?Everybody loves different things. For Jennifer, it would be a harp seal or a sturgeon. For me, strangely enough, I do like clownfish. In South Australia, there are sea dragons and in the Gulf of St Lawrence there’s the Atlantic wolffish. It’s like being asked who’s your favorite child.How different are the challenges between island and ice diving?Diving here is easy, simple — you wear a suit, you go on a boat. In the Antarctic and the Arctic, you wear extremely thick dry suits, waterproof dry suits. We use the most sophisticated dry suits manufactured in Sweden. You have to know the paramaters of little things, like if your hand gets cold you can be in very serious trouble because you can’t get your equipment off. Obviously, polar diving is far more intensive but on the other hand it’s far shorter. A safe scuba dive is about an hour, you can do another hour after that and another one. But to stay in longer than an hour you lose feelings in your fingertips, so you have to balance that out and also be aware of your core temperature.What is the biggest mistake that underwater photographers make and what is your advice for beginners?For divers who want to be underwater photographers, I tell them, “Don’t.” I’m very serious. Don’t do it until you’ve had about a hundred dives. You’re not going to enjoy it, you won’t be happy. You have to look and see and do… I’d recommend to shoot in black and white, but here in Anilao you have wonderful colors. Start with a simple camera, even the camera phones are good. Then you begin to build up things. I think the problem with many photographers is they become very repetitive, so they have to find something they’re very comfortable with and have a look at other people’s pictures.I was talking to photographer Jun de Leon earlier and he said shooting macro made him “realize that there are no accidents, and there is a creator of all of this. Something that small cannot be an accident.” Is diving a religious experience for you as well?In many ways, yes it is. Because you look at something and say, is this the end of evolution or has it taken one more path it’s such a surprise? It’s the force of life on earth. I’m not religious at all — a lot of people are and diving reinforces their beliefs. But it certainly is an evolutionary experience. I think for people who are creationists, it’s not exactly the place to be because everything changes all the time. God didn’t create the leafy sea dragon, something evolved.And then which God created the leafy sea dragon? Was it Jewish, was it Catholic, Christian, Buddhist or Hindu? It’s this constant evolution of this planet and the absolute force of biology to change. But the thing is, no matter how scientific you are, you’ll get to an end point. And after that, that’s when you have the unanswered question, that’s the religious question: How did it all come about? That happens in diving a lot — the constant surprise. And you’re right, it is a very religious moment.* * *Visit the author’s travel blog at www.findingmyway.net.

"A scratch – and sniff test that asks subjects to identify 40 odors and ranks olfaction is almost as powerful as a predictor of Alzheimer’s disease is a positive test of amyloid.Low scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) are linked to a thinning of the entorhinal cortex – the brain region where amyloid plaques are thought to first appear as Alzheimer’s disease takes hold, reported at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.The findings indirectly suggest that impairment in odor identification may precede thinning in the entorhinal cortex in the early clinical stage of AD.According to him, poor UPSIT sores are also related to brain levels of amyloid beta and are almost as predictive of cognitive decline.These sensory changes appear to be one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease, the researcher said at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference. Their studies also suggest that the test has a place in the clinic as an easy and inexpensive screening tool for patients with memory complaints said at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.The amyloid biomarker tests currently available are not suitable for wide dissemination. Amyloid brain scans are currently investigative; and not covered by Medicare or any private insurance. Lumbar punctures are also invasive and expensive and almost universally disliked by patients. In addition, there is little consensus on how to interpret CSF amyloid levels.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1“We need easy, noninvasive biomarkers that can be deployed in the clinic for patients who are concerned about their risk of memory decline,” said Columbia University Medical Center, New York.His study concluded that the UPSIT predicted Alzheimer’s disease almost as well as invasive amyloid biomarkers. The scratch – and – sniff test asks subjects to identify 40 odors and ranks olfaction as a normal or mildly, moderately, or severely impaired.He examined the relationship between UPSIT and brain amyloid beta in 84 subjects, 58 of whom had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. All of these subjects had either an amyloid brain scan or lumbar puncture to measure amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid. They were followed for at least six months.At follow-up, 67 percent of the group of participants showed cognitive decline. After correction for age, gender, and education, patients who were amyloid- positive on imaging or in CSF were more than seven times as likely to have experienced cognitive decline. However, when it was imputed as a continuous variable, patients with a score of less than 35 on the 40-item test were four times more likely to show cognitive decline than those with a score of 35 or higher.In fact, these low UPSIT scores were much more common among amyloid-positive patients. Of the 38 patients who were positive for amyloid beta on either diagnostic test, 32 had an UPSIT score less than 35, while six had a score of 35 or greater. Among the 46 amyloid-negative patients, 28 had low UPSIT scores, and 18 had normal UPSIT scores.A separate study examined the relationship of UPSIT performance to entorhinal cortical thickness in 397 cognitively healthy subjects who were involved in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project. These subjects took the UPSIT and had magnetic resonance brain imaging both at baseline and at four years’ follow-up. Over that time, 50 transitioned to dementia, and 49 of them were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Another 79 subjects experienced cognitive decline.In comparing the groups with and without dementia, he found significant differences in the follow-up UPSIT score (23 vs. 27) and entorhinal cortical thickness (2.9 vs. 3.1 mm).One standard deviation in performance on the UPSIT score was associated with a significant 47 percent increase in the risk of dementia, while one standard deviation in entorhinal cortical thickness was associated with a 22 percent increase in the risk. However, he said, the interaction of entorhinal thickness and UPSIT score was significant only in the group of subjects who transitioned to dementia.","Smell test reflects brain pathologies, risk of Alzheimers  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"The sound of gunshots ricocheted down 12th Street as a tank burst through the thick black smoke rolling down the road.“There was a lot of boom, boom, boom,” said Maurice Wilson. “Before the soldiers got here it was nothing but smoke … there was shooting, a whole lot of shooting.”Back in 1967 Wilson was just 15, too young to be scared of the unrest enveloping Detroit. But to this day he clearly remembers the soldiers, the shooting and the smoke.A police raid at an after hours bar known as a blind pig on July 23, 1967 was the spark that ignited a fiery, five-day civil disturbance. Before the clouds cleared and the fires flickered out, 43 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. Thousands were arrested. Looting was rampant and whole blocks were destroyed, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.“The Vietnam war was going on, but it was like we were the ones being attacked,” said Wilson, now 65. “We were having it right in our backyards.”In this July 1967 file photo, a National Guardsman stands at a Detroit intersection during riots in the city. (AP Photo/File)Wilson grew up two streets over from the blind pig and still occupies the same house today. With a garden-gloved finger he points around the neighbourhood he’s lived in all his life, like a general noting enemy positions.“The tanks were up there by the freeway,” he said, before swinging his arm to indicate a run-down home. “They had soldiers shooting out with a sniper back there.”‘I couldn’t believe this was happening in my city’Fifty years ago, Isaiah McKinnon was one of only a few dozen African American police officers on the front line as the riot roiled his hometown.His day started with a 6 a.m. call from his Sergeant saying rioting had begun and he needed to report for duty. McKinnon hung up. He thought the other officer was kidding.“He called back and said ‘Ike, this is serious, we’re not kidding. Get to work right away.'”Isaiah McKinnon was one of only a few dozen black police officers in Detroit back in 1967. During the first night of the riot he was shot at by his fellow officers despite being in uniform. (Dan Taekema/CBC)As the rookie policeman drove to the station he saw people breaking store windows and looting. Soon he was in a car with three other officers with the impossible task of holding back the tide of animosity and anger that had boiled over onto the streets of Detroit.“It was chaotic, it was frightening and it was a situation where you said to yourself ‘God I hope this stops soon,’ because it was really out of control,” he said. “I couldn’t believe this was happening in my city.”McKinnon worked for 18 hours nonstop, fighting back that fear and trying to protect people from the panic all around them.Multiple fires burn in a section of riot-torn Detroit on July 24, 1967, about three miles west of the downtown area. Five days of violence would leave 33 blacks and 10 whites dead, and more than 1,400 buildings burned. More than 7,000 people were arrested. (AP Photo/File)But as he finally headed home to rest for a few hours at the centre of the storm it was the young black officer who found himself in need of protection from his fellow officers.McKinnon was still in uniform when he was pulled over by two white cops. The policeman called out, telling them he was an officer, but they ordered him out of his car.The older cop pointed his gun right at McKinnon and said, “You’re going to die tonight.”“At that moment time froze,” he remembered. “I could see his hand pulling the trigger.”McKinnon dove into his car, pressing the gas with one hand and steering with the other as bullets flew past.Hope for the futureYears later, McKinnon became Detroit’s police chief and eventually acted as deputy mayor. He said when he thinks back to that night and the days of rioting afterwards he recalls a lesson learned from his father.“They were not police officers, they were vigilantes, they were rogues. Anybody who goes out and does that kind of thing doesn’t deserve to wear a badge,” he said. “My dad always says ‘Son there’s good and bad in every race.'”It’s important to remember the rebellion had its underlying causes, he added. For years black people were blocked from restaurants, schools, jobs and frustration and anger built up until it burst onto the street.Thomas Gordon Park now sits on the site that once housed the bling pig, an after hours bar that was raided in 1967, sparking the Detroit riot. (Dan Taekema/CBC)Change has been slow, but it is coming, said McKinnon. Detroit is changing too.“I want people to remember that Detroit was and is a great city,” he said. “We’ve gone through some terrible times, but we shall rise again. We shall.”Today, 12th Street has been renamed Rosa Parks Boulevard. A park where children laugh and play sits at the site of the blind pig.Throughout the neighbourhood, evidence of revitalization is everywhere. Boarded up buildings are being given fresh coats of paint and broken masonry is being torn down.Signs or revitalization can be seen all around the neighbourhood near the corner of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Clairmount Avenue where the riot began back in 1967. (Dan Taekema/CBC)Wilson said said life is coming back to 12th Street. As he pulls weeds around white and red flowers, he looks down the road, now clear of smoke and soldiers, and sees signs of something he never expected.“For a moment there I thought there wasn’t going to be any future the way Detroit was going down, down, down,” he said. “Now I have great hope for it, great hope.”","Youre going to die tonight: Detroiters remember the smoke, soldiers and bullets of 1967  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"The imminent tax on sugared drinks such as soft drinks, energy drinks and powdered drinks, is reason for sari-sari store owners and CDE classes to worry. And beverage manufacturers, sugar planters and sugar plantation laborers as well.A sari-sari store owner said at a Bulong Pulungan session that majority of her customers are expected to stop buying their favorite Tang fruit powder drinks. While a sachet of the powdered drink now costs P10, presumably in January next year, it will cost P13. That is, once the law imposing an excise tax of P3 on powdered sugar beverages goes into effect.The sachet contains 25 grams of sugar (16 grams of which are sugar and flavors), and once mixed with 75 grams of water, make five glasses or one liter of juice. In effect, the consumer will pay P13 for 25 grams of sugar and five glasses of water. The sari-sari store owner, Vicky Aguinaldo of Paranaque asks, “Why do we have to pay for five glasses of water?”Indeed, why can’t we just pay for the sugar content? The P3 added to an P11 sachet is big money for wage earners who can hardly make both ends meet. This will mean reduced income for sari-sari store owners run mostly by housewives forced to help augment their husbands’ meager earnings.Vicky is president of the Association of Sari-sari Stores and Carinderias which counts 6,000 members. Most of the stores are hole in the wall affairs selling an assortment of goods ranging from chichirias to cigarettes, match sticks, salt and vinegar and canned goods, but 40 percent of their sales is derived from soda (Coke, Pepsi, Tru Orange, Sprite, some energy drinks) and powdered drinks in sachets.The powdered drinks in sachets are a blessing to the CDE classes (with some from the B class for sure) because they are “stretched” to quench the thirst of family members (mostly with four to five children), the kids’ baon and construction workers.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1The Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) excise tax was proposed in the House since last year and is now under extrapolation in the Senate. Former Congressman Romulo Roman, who is currently president of the Beverage Industry Association of the Philippines, expressed at Bulong Pulungan his hope that the legislators study the ramifications of the proposal and lower the tax rates to benefit consumers and small entrepreneurs.Cherry Pinga-Ramos, Mondelez Philippines Inc. external affairs manager, said the giant conglomerate is supportive of the Department of Finance’s Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN), which aims to raise revenue to finance the government’s high priority development projects. But Mondelez and Romulo hope not only for lower taxation but also for a “level playing field” in the powdered beverage (BB) segment, by for example enjoying the exemption privilege granted the 3-in-1 coffee mixes.Mondelez markets several globally iconic snack brands such as Tang powdered beverages (which has 16 flavors), Eden cheese, Toblerone, Tiger Energy, Dairy Milk, Oreo biscuits and Halls candy.As Cherry said, Tang beverages are fortified with vitamins that help address the micronutrient deficiency of Filipinos. One serving of Tang provides 100 percent of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C requirement for children and is a good source of Vitamin A, B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B6 iron and folic acid. Cherry said since 2012, Tang has reduced its sugar content in the Philippines by 127 percent, making each serving only 20 calories.Furthermore, Mondelez maintains that the proposed volumetric tax system, or taxation by liter, does not work particularly for the powdered beverage segment because 85 percent to 90 percent of the volume to be taxed is the zero-calorie water that is added to the powdered concentrate to make a one-liter drink.We’ve touched only the higher cost of sugar sweetened powdered drinks. But an excise tax will also be imposed on soft drinks and carbonated drinks, sweetened milk, tea and coffee, and sports drinks and energy drinks.Authors of the original House Bill 292 are (1st District, Nueva Ecija) Rep. Estrellita Suansing and (1st District Sultan Kudarat) Rep. Horacio P. Suansing Jr. Rep. Estrellita Suansing was quoted as saying the bill is “more of a health measure,” and intended to dissuade consumption of sugar.According to Jesus Barrera, deputy director of the Philippines Sugar Millers Association Inc., it was established during the public hearings of the committee on ways and means of the House of Representatives and the Senate, that there is no local study that shows a correlation or causality between beverage consumption among Filipinos and increase in obesity, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases attributed to sugar. What is apparent, according to a study of the University of Asia and the Pacific on Sugar and Sweetener Consumption in the Philippines is that sugar consumption has been declining in recent years.The final excise tax will be known hopefully soon. A source of anxiety is that the tax could be higher than what consumers and sugar millers can afford. A serious point of contention is whether beverages using local refined sugar on one hand and imported high fructose corn syrup on the other hand should be taxed the same rate.Why should sugar be taxed with a lower rate? Barrera says, “The sugar industry is one of the major employment and revenue generators in the Philippine countryside and in the agricultural sector. The industry provides direct employment to 700,000 Filipinos, of which 50,000 are small farmers and agrarian reform beneficiaries and nearly 650,000 farm and mill/refinery workers spread across 20 sugarcane farming provinces across the country.”“The sugarcane farming and sugar production already make significant contributions to the revenue stream of government,” Barrera continues. “The industry had a P42.4 billion total gross value of farm production in 2015, plus a ‘multiplier effect’ in cities and municipalities where sugar mills/refineries are located. For example, in Bukidnon, the operations of the two mills generate about P1 billion in economic activity a month during the milling season. In addition, the sugar industry paid P7 billion in direct and indirect taxes in 2015 alone, plus P105 billion annual value added from sugar’s various products and support industries.”“A high excise tax will reduce sugar demand, which will then affect incomes of farmers, who are mostly poor.”* * *Email: dominitorrevillas@gmail.com",When sugars not sweet  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"Ovarian cancer is known as the ""silent killer"" because women often experience no symptoms until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. is known as thebecause women often experience no symptoms until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage.The study, by the National Institute of Environmental Sciences is the first to link the ovarian cancer to the procedure - which is reportedly practiced by millions of women.Some women practice private part washing , because they think it would make them cleaner. But, what they didn't know that this can cause some serious and dangerous health problems.Most doctors would recommend against the practice of squirting water, or fluids into the vagina because it changes the natural balance of healthy bacteria and can make it easier to pick up infections.One survey discovered that 29% of 232 people actually admitted that they are regularly washed and 57% admitted that they never did it.Based on this research it was discovered that flushing can be related to pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, fungal infections and reduced fertility.Experts link this so called vagina self cleaning with many other health diseases like reduced fertility, yeast infections, pelic inflammatory disease, different kind of infections etc.Joelle Brown is epidemiology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and she was not involved in the study, but she said that link between douching and ovarian cancer took her by surprise.Even though, almost all of the gynecologist and doctors do not recommend douching as a method of cleaning the vagina, some women continue to do it, watching only the positive side of it, that is better hygiene.",ATTENTION GIRLS: This Habit You Regularly Do In The Shower Doubles The Risks of Developing Cancer
"Back in November, the city council in Denver, Colo. unanimously voted to ban the cruel and unnecessary practice of cat declawing.The decision put the city onside other jurisdictions that have prohibited the procedure, including much of California, Australia, Brazil, Israel, the UK and much of Europe. New York City and the state of New Jersey are also currently considering a ban.Across Canada, though, cat declawing remains perfectly legal. But with vets in Nova Scotia now voting on the matter, there is much hope among animal advocates that a ban starting in the east could get the rest of the country on board to prohibit this archaic and barbaric practice.Amputating boneThe term “declawing” is actually a misnomer, which suggests that the procedure simply removes a cat’s claws. In fact, it requires an amputation of the end bones of the animal’s toes, and is typically used as a lazy solution for destructive and/or aggressive behaviour. That’s right: in Canada, a cat can be legally subjected to amputation for scratching up furniture or swiping at humans, which are common cat behavioural issues that can and should be remedied by basic or professional training.Last March, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) issued a statement expressing their opposition to “elective and non-therapeutic Partial Digital Amputation (PDA), commonly known as declawing or onychectomy, of domestic cats.”The debate over cat de-clawing in P.E.I.1:25The statement explained that the procedure causes needless suffering and offers no advantage to the animal, and added that advanced research in animal behaviour now allows vets “to help clients modify unwanted scratching behaviour without the completion of an Onychectomy.” But even with the CVMA deeming the procedure ethically unacceptable, legislation has yet to be written banning cat declawing in Canada.And so, it keeps happening. One Ontario veterinary assistant who spoke on condition of anonymity says he sees roughly two procedures per week at the clinic where he is employed. About the trauma he sees in cats after declawing, he said: “I see cats stressed, consistent licking in the paw area, behaviour change in some cases, looking sad, depressed.”Phantom painDr. Judith Weissmann, veterinarian and owner of Clinique Vétérinaire Plateau Mont Royal in Montreal, says her practice has never performed a declawing surgery. “The surgery is not only painful and unnecessary from a medical perspective, but it can also result in phantom pain if not done properly, or if pain management is not handled adequately,” she says.Dr. Weissmann tells of one middle-aged cat who was recently brought into her clinic with signs of chronic limping. “When we performed x-rays we could see many bone fragments that remained from an incomplete or improperly performed declawing procedure from many years ago at another clinic.” Dr. Weissmann says the procedure is notoriously performed with varying degrees of quality.Similar medically unnecessary veterinary surgeries, such as ear-cropping and tail-docking of dogs and cats, are also still legal under federal law in Canada. However, they have been banned by provincial law or regulatory bylaws in eight provinces; ear-cropping has been prohibited in B.C., Manitoba and Saskatchewan, while both ear-cropping and tail-docking have been banned in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and most recently, in Quebec. Vets in these jurisdictions who perform the procedures can face disciplinary actions and possible charges.But while federal animal welfare laws remain infamously lax, the widespread prohibition on cosmetic ear-cropping and tail-docking in Canada demonstrates the capability not only of provincial veterinary regulating bodies, but also of compassionate city councillors to effect change when it comes to medically unnecessary surgical procedures on animals. And it’s obvious that cat declawing should be next on the list.It is ethically unjustifiable to amputate an animal’s body parts simply to protect humans or furniture from being scratched. Canada is past due in joining other jurisdictions in banning this cruel and unwarranted practice. We animal advocates hope the vote in Nova Scotia will finally set this change in motion.This column is part of CBC’s Opinion section.

"Each November for the past 10 years, the province of Tarlac ushers in what is called “the longest Christmas in the world” — Pinoy Christmas, that is, with its own brand of grand spectacle called Belenismo sa Tarlac. Belenismo, or the art of making a belen, is a province-wide community undertaking of Tarlaqueños that has earned the province the title “Belen-making capital of the Philippines.”Traditions of old bayanihan or communal unity, Pinoy creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness, and the Filipinos’ innate love for all things celebratory, is evident in the assemblage of masterfully crafted crèches both large and small, depicting the Nativity scene — the heart of Christmas.For 10 years, the indefatigable mother-and-daughter tandem of Isabel Cojuangco Suntay and Dr. Isa Cojuangco Suntay, founders of the Tarlac Heritage Foundation, Inc., have been tirelessly bringing together individuals, barangays, municipalities, schools, organizations and business establishments in orchestrating Tarlac’s greatest attraction during this holiday season of merriment — transcending economic class, political and religious choices.This year is extra special in that the Belenismo sa Tarlac is not only celebrating a decade of honoring the birth of the child Jesus through its famed crèches. This year, the Belenismo sa Tarlac pays tribute to our bothers and sisters in Marawi, and the heroes who fought for their freedom. Taking center stage in this tribute is the Belen of the Hall of Fame awardees — the Philippine Army 7th Infantry Division, Mechanized Infantry Division, and Philippine National Police Regional Office 3.Entitled “Marawi sa Panahon ng Kapayapaan,” this belen stands proudly on the grounds of the Northern Luzon Command in Camp Aquino in Tarlac City. Handmade by soldiers and policemen (many of whom served and fought in Marawi), the belen is made of recycled materials and is set against a backdrop of the ruins of the five-month war in Mindanao. It was designed by one of the Belenismo’s longtime advocates, Ding Mercado.At the final judging last Nov. 18, our valiant heroes headed by Philippine Army Lt. Gen. Rolando Joselito Bautista were there in full force to dedicate their obra maestra to their fallen comrades in the recent war in Mindanao. Sgt. Ronnie Halasan of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division also gave an emotional performance of his original composition Bangon Marawi. Halasan said he wrote the song during the first week of battle in Marawi, when he was assigned to bring supplies to government forces fighting terrorists inside the city. Asked for the overall message of his song, he said: “Kailangan talaga magtulungan. Magtulungan ang bawat isa upang bumangon ulit ang Marawi.”Lifestyle Feature – Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1And what has become a tradition for the past 10 years, Belenismo sa Tarlac 2017 officially marked this year’s start of Christmas for the judges composed of Ding Mercado, Boysie Villavicencio, Johnny Co, Reina Tan, Gigi Sanares, Carlo Rojas, Mike Mina, my sisters Michelle Dayrit-Soliven and Yvonne Dayrit-Romualdez, myself, and members of various media networks, as we visited the 21 belens that made the cut to the finals.Holland and beyondThe entry of Capas stood out as a winner with imposing replicas of the windmills of Holland using recycled scrap G.I. pipes and iron sourced locally from the junk shops of Capas. Creatively and delicately infused in this masterpiece is — believe it or not —carabao manure. Collected from nearby Crow Valley Gunnery Range in Barangay Sta. Juliana along the trek to Mt. Pinatubo, where the dried carabao manure was collected and carefully transformed into glittering colorful floral-like works of art that decorate the belen, leaving the judges in awe of the humility that went into the creation of this entry.“Born to Save” is a grand and theatrical interpretation of the crèche by the municipality of Moncada. Steampunk-inspired, it incorporates technology and aesthetics drawn from 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. It features vintage fashion elements using native and modern materials with a millennial twist provided by the brightly lit giant marquee reading “Born to Save.”Fish be with youThis playful but meaningful creation symbolizes the source of livelihood of Concepcion, Tarlac — fish culture. Their entry depicts the Nativity scene where the Holy Family is enveloped in a giant fish that is made out of indigenous materials such as bamboo, bulo, woven straw mats, abaniko, bilao, burlap sack, and abaca, festooned with festive lighting making it look like it’s shimmering in the rays of the golden sun. The giant fish belen is surrounded with depictions of Filipino traditions and representations of the other livelihood sources of Concepcion.In San Manuel municipality, the country’s Outstanding Yellow Corn producer and a rising agricultural town in the province, the winning belen is made out of recycled styrofoam packs, plastic bottles and indigenous materials such as bamboo meticulously assembled into a dramatic and magnificent half circle backdrop of yellow corncobs.In San Clemente, staging a belen with the theme “Environmental Protection and Preservation” has become a tradition. This year’s entry speaks about protecting our oceans and seas from climate change, pollution and decades of overfishing threats — thereby presenting a colorful, life-sized “under the sea” backdrop for the Nativity scene made out of indigenous materials, recycled plastic materials and other recyclable resources from the previous belen entries.I’m a fan!In preparation for the coming 500th anniversary, in 2021, of the arrival of Christianity in the country, Saint Francis of Assisi Parish belen in San Manuel pays homage to a tradition that has been at the heart of Filipino Christmas for centuries — the Simbang Gabi, as represented in the white nine-panel giant fan backdrop of the Nativity scene. It is also an acknowledgement of our gratitude to Spain for the faith that we now have.The tribute to Marawi is also echoed in the winning belen of McDonald’s Capas. It features stylized and colorful Moro vintas, umbrellas, brass gongs, and the Holy Family in traditional Muslim-inspired clothing, all handmade from indigenous materials by the crew.At the St. Joseph Parish Church in Barangay O’Donnel, Capas, Tarlac, its parishioners headed by Fr. Noel Paguinto adopted the “Taon ng Parokya” or Year of the Parish (declared by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines) as the theme of their winning belen. The crèche, mounted in a lampshape frame, sits on a sturdy star-shape structure made out of bricks.In the Community Category of the Belenismo sa Tarlac, Sto. Cristo Parish utilized a caromata, a transportation mode from the old Philippines, for their belen that bagged the top prize in that category. The caromata then was used to ferry not only people but goods as well. This Christmas, the decorated caromata is envisioned to ferry God-made-man Jesus to the hearts of people so that in his humanity we will experience his divinity. The backdrop of the caromata is inspired by the colorful Masskara Festival of Bacolod, because it seems Jesus in becoming man masked himself with our humanity.Sharing the top spot with Sto. Cristo Parish is a simple creation of the SVDF Choir of Barangay Balingcanaway, Tarlac City. Called “Belen sa Bulaklak,” it features the Nativity scene with the Holy Family on a colorful floral-shaped structure — actually the shape of the map of Tarlac province upon closer inspection, made out of recycled and recyclable materials.Another notable winner in the Community Category that caught the judges’ eyes is this year’s refreshing entry by BHF Ligtasan — a simple Nativity scene on a meticulously landscaped deck with fresh flora. Faux giant taro leaves were infused in the setting to highlight the Baby Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. A modern twist and treatment was given to the gifts of the Three Kings — appliances placed around the scene, connecting it to the business of BHF.Belenismo sa Tarlac, indeed, is season of giving and sharing, of making others happy. It is a respite from the drudgery of life — steering the weary towards peace and goodwill. Merry Christmas!* * *Belenismo sa Tarlac runs until January 2018.

Email marketing can be useful, but it comes with restrictions that could limit your blog's potential. Perhaps the most significant problem is that emails don't come with a face or personality like Facebook does.Think of a time when you received an email in you inbox from someone you didn't know. Where you inclined to open it or did you send it right to the junk folder? If it's your first introduction to new consumer, they simply don't know who you are, what you want, and how you got their email. This sets off an initial breakdown of any type of trust that might have developed. The reputation of email marketing is further deteriorated with a study done by Kaspersky Lab, an Internet research firm. They estimate that around 70% of all the emails sent in the world are spam.Sharing site content using a Facebook Like Box is just one of many strategies that can generate a regular flow of traffic from a diverse demographic that might have been previously inaccessible.

"President Rodrigo Duterte is being attacked at all sides with allegations about extrajudicial killings, abusive anti-drug war, and brushoff with international figures, but amidst all the controversy where anything has yet to be proven, an anonymous lawyer and former prosecutor urges the Filipinos to protect the President.Social media personality Atty. Bruce Rivera posted on Facebook the open letter of the anonymous lawyer saying that as the media, international entities, and Yellows try to bring down the President, Filipinos should become Duterte’s “wind beneath his wings”.In the first place, it was the Filipinos who asked Duterte a favor to fix the ailing nation, thus, as he continues to execute the task, the support must remain solid in the face of adversaries like “powerful traditional politicians (trapos)”, “ business elites”, “ignorant international entities”, “ and all too mighty disgraced media.”The anonymous lawyer cited media as the first enemy that has converted its watchdog role into “hound dogs and werewolves”. Instead of safeguarding public interest, it continues to destabilize the Philippines by highlighting the negativities about Duterte whether it is credible information or not.ABS CBN, GMA, Rappler, and international media may claim to be practicing their mandate as the Fourth Estate, but the lawyer said that nowhere in the world is that mandate “institutionally enshrined”.International figures such as the UsS, United Nations, European Union, and other foreign communities have done their part in contributing to the attack on Duterte’s presidency.They take in the twisted figures reported by local media and use it as basis to structure arguments, accusations, and resolutions against the President.In the anonymous lawyer’s full post on Rivera’s Facebook, it said,""Dear Filipinos,This writer is just an ordinary citizen of the Philippines. One among the more than 100 million people being governed by President Rodrigo Duterte and I know my voice is negligible but I decided to make a stand hoping that the rest of the greater majority of the Filipino who believes in Duterte would provide the wind in his sails amidst the barrage of attacks against him from all fronts.WE ASKED HIM THIS FAVORAre we really that oblivious of the fact that we pleaded for President Duterte to run for office? A song prior to the election even assured him that should his feet be weary and tired from running, that we shall be the wind beneath his wings. This is the opportune moment for us to make good such assurance to the good President. Now more than ever, he needs the resolute voice, protection and support of the vast majority of Filipinos as he engages the very few yet powerful traditional politicians ( trapos ), the business elites who are devoid of patriotic hearts, the ignorant international entities and of course the all too mighty disgraced media. If we as a nation fail to rally behind this once in a lifetime President, then we are deserving of a decayed nation and we lose every right to complain about our plight.THE MEDIAWhere do you source your abundant malevolence? How do you replenish your zest for ignorance and want of conscience? Can all of you still look at the mirror and see a reflection of a decent soul?All of you keep harping on Extra Judicial Killing as if it is like a daily routine , similar to brushing your teeth that thrice a day you have to relegate this into the spot light. You hide under the cloak of being SELF PROCLAIMED WATCH DOGS, but do you really know that nowhere in Journalism Principles in the world does that concept exist nor has it ever been institutionally enshrined? In the words of President Duterte, “ Where the Hell” did you ever get that thought? My answer? Precisely from HELL!Even assuming for the sake of argument that you are watch dogs as you proclaim to be, then you have the obligation to watch and be balanced and responsible. Such is not the case with you ABS CBN, GMA 7, Rappler and International Media. You are acting more like hound dogs and werewolves. In many occasions you acted worst than vultures.Where has the dignity and prudence of Journalism gone? You are not Journalists . You can all be beaten by decent University Students in how they think and handle themselves and yet you wallow in the delusion that you are all professionals. Really now? Professionals ? Questions about gums? Questions about why the President went to China ? Questions about why the President is threatening criminals ? Questions about why the President is putting his foot down on America? Do you really not comprehend or you just refuse to comprehend? Or you are really devoid of the mental capacity to understand a simple issue? If it is the latter, then you don’t have any business reporting because you are belching and feeding people polluted information.You focus on trivial matters and matters which you believe can sell your stories You magnify things and demonize the President because it is in accord with the wishes of your Masters and it will sell your convoluted stories.You ought to be ashamed of even breathing as you have abandoned your responsibility to give an objective news reporting. Yes, you can report bad news but look at your percentage over good news. If you can claim they are balanced, then the more than 95% of Filipinos who support the President, including this writer should be condemned and executed. Your reckless abandon in typing your articles which we call trash have painted our country in bad light all over the world. You can and should claim authorship of that. When this country goes to the drain, I hope you can all sleep well dear media moguls and your paid assassins. Free Speech is not a license and you do not own a franchise of what you think is right for our country.THE USA, UN , EU and the Rest of the International Watch DogWe do not meddle in your affairs and we expect the same courtesy. It is however revolting to realize that you are so sanctimonious in stamping your unsolicited authority over us as if we are really a nation undeserving of respect. You blindly swallow the reports of media as hook line and sinker and marches on the offensive against our President. Has your success in bedeviling Marcos in the past inspired you to try it again? Are we really like a nation of mendicants that you choke for fun? Stop managing our nation and leave us in standing up with dignity no matter how hard and how tedious it would be.Follow this simple principle: Only those with clean hands can have moral authority to dictate upon others. Question: DO YOU HAVE CLEAN HANDS ?If you answer in the affirmative, then you are indeed one bunch of self righteous idiots!To the YellowtardsYou have raped the nation for so long and you have seriously believed that you can continuously fool and brainwash a nation. Reality will hit all of you hard when you realize that your antics will no longer slave the people. We had enough of you. You have managed to drive the Philippines to the depths of hell after you orchestrated the downfall of Marcos and now you are at it again with President Duterte.Divine justice has a great way of finding you back and lashing at you hard. The people will not allow any of you anymore to do the same tricks your false heroes like Cory and Ninoy did to Marcos. President Duterte is the Philippine President , he is our President and he and not you will define our destiny. So to the Aquinos and your hound dogs ( Trillianes, De Lima, Hontiveros , Drillon , Lagman, Pangilinan and the usurper of the VP position, Robredo ) , we suggest you enjoy your last days in glory because your political stock will go down the drain in front of your very eyes because WE ARE NOW NOT ONLY AN AWAKENED NATION, but we are a DETERMINED PROTECTOR OF CHANGETo the People of the PhilippinesPresident Duterte has been non-stop. One need not be a doctor to see the exhaustion in his eyes. He has a nation to heal and discipline and yet he is bombarded everyday by these people who care less about the repercussions of their acts. May we shield him and provide him inspiration that is because the seat he reluctantly occupies is a very lonely and thankless one.We complain as a nation why we have fallen behind other Asian Countries but at the same time we fail to acknowledge that these countries we envy metamorphosed owing to discipline and strong governance. We were ahead of Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in the years of old and now all we see are the smoke from the tailpipe of their progress. Do we still honestly believe that Vietnam is still behind us? If we do, then we are really a one big hallucinating nation because Vietnam had already made strides that overtook us by leaps and bounds. Should Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos catch up on us, then we really are a nation of loud mouths with no future. These people harping on Human rights and freedom have a tailored self serving definition of which and they are the same people who have for years supported the yellow bloods and look where it has brought us ? To the dumps.If we cannot rally behind the President, if we cannot realize how special this man is to the Philippines and if we fail to acknowledge why the Lord moved his hands to place him in power, then let us be human enough to let President Duterte go back to his private life because it is unfair for him to be assassinated or for him to lose his health just because he wanted a better nation for us. Let us not be selfish. Let the man go and let us all be resigned to the fact that we are a doomed nation and the perpetual doormat of Asia and the world.However, should we believe in the man and the good Lord above and should we really desire a new Philippines, let our little voices be lumped together and be a force to reckon with.I want a better Philippines. We only have one chance at this .I want to be counted in the army of civilians for President Duterte. Do you?""",Public Trending
"This statement was made earlier this month as government troops battled against Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists.In a report by the Inquirer, the MILF spokesperson said that the humanitarian efforts of the MILF came after MILF Chief Al Haj Murad met with President Rodrigo Duterte on the evening of May 29 in Davao City.According to Jaafar, their group has been helping Maranaos escape the violence in the city long before the meeting with the president took place.“We escorted them out of their homes to nearby towns outside the city,” he said.Jaafar also confirmed that sometime during the siege in Marawi City on May 23 – MILF militias open fired at the militants who were trying to blow up the bridge in the aforementioned city.“With the President’s go-signal, our troops there have been instructed to help in bringing out of the city the remaining civilians,” Jaafar said.However, despite the shared history between the MILF and the Maute group, there seems to be no love lost between the two groups.The spokesperson said there was no executive order for MILF forces to fight alongside with government forces against the ISIS-aligned Maute terror group.As of writing, the group’s focus has solely been the rescue civilians who remained trapped in the city. They were told to save these civilians regardless of whether they were MILF relatives or not.Yesterday it was reported by GMA News, that rescue teams of both MILF and government volunteers would reenter the war zone. Both groups would take advantage of the military’s eight-hour ceasefire in order to recover the bodies of the slain.Assistant Secretary Dickson Hermoso of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process had made this statement.“Our mission is to retrieve warm bodies. Our volunteers from the MILF will go to the ground, knock on the doors at the houses there, use megaphones and use the local vernacular of Maranao to entice them (trapped civilians) and bring them to the safe zone.”The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced the eight-hour ceasefire last Sunday night to allow Marawi City residents to peacefully celebrate the end of the month-long Ramadan known as Eid’l Fitr.The ceasefire which began at 6 AM will end at 2 PM.Watch the viral video report here:The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) political affairs chief Ghadzali Jaafar said the group’s forces have been helping evacuate civilians out Marawi city.This statement was made earlier this month as government troops battled against Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists.In a report by the Inquirer, the MILF spokesperson said that the humanitarian efforts of the MILF came after MILF Chief Al Haj Murad met with President Rodrigo Duterte on the evening of May 29 in Davao City.According to Jaafar, their group has been helping Maranaos escape the violence in the city long before the meeting with the president took place.“We escorted them out of their homes to nearby towns outside the city,” he said.Jaafar also confirmed that sometime during the siege in Marawi City on May 23 – MILF militias open fired at the militants who were trying to blow up the bridge in the aforementioned city.“With the President’s go-signal, our troops there have been instructed to help in bringing out of the city the remaining civilians,” Jaafar said.However, despite the shared history between the MILF and the Maute group, there seems to be no love lost between the two groups.The spokesperson said there was no executive order for MILF forces to fight alongside with government forces against the ISIS-aligned Maute terror group.As of writing, the group’s focus has solely been the rescue civilians who remained trapped in the city.

Pasikatin ang mag kapatid na to. Btw nareport na namen sila sa pulis! :) ingat nalang tayo guys!""A netizen chased down two female thieves who swiped his phone together with its charger. You're probably wondering how the thieves managed to steal both phone and charger, right? Well, phone snatchers in Manila are that good in swiping things that don't belong to them and the items were inside the victim's backpack.With a sleight of the hand, netizen Von Joshua Nicolas lost his phone to the two female perpetrators while waiting for the bus near a footbridge. Fortunately, he had friends with him who noticed a woman opened his bag but he was unsure how to react because it was a woman. He eventually told Von Joshua of what had just transpired while the women were walking away.They caught up with the culprits at a nearby eatery where Nicolas confronted the two women asking them to give him back his phone and charger and a wallet from one other victim who was also with them.Not easily fazed by the victims demand, the women, who were siblings, repeatedly denied the allegation, but when pressed to empty their pockets, the women walked out. Man, they always do that when they're losing the argument.Anyway, the victims were eager to get back their things so they followed the women and continued pressing the woman to give it up. The women broke into a trot. The men, who were the victims, followed then it was a full speed chased now.One of the perps finally gave up Nicolas' phone. The victim (who's a man by the way) picked it up and started what all normal theft victims would do to the perpetrator:record a video.It can be seen in the video that the victim was chasing the alleged thieves in the middle of heavily trafficked highway. At one point one of the women told him to stop being maarte na because he got his phone back na.But no, it's not over, yet. ""Where's the damn charger, woman?"", said Von Joshua in his mind. ""Give it up or I will repeatedly punch you in the teeth like you are man"", he might have added. But no. Von Joshua chose to do right thing and that was to ask 'why?' and do nothing violent to the women. Besides, one of them is pregnant.The incident was already reported to the police according to the victim's post below:",Video of Female Cellphone Thieves Being Chased By Victim Goes Viral
"JERUSALEM - Putting his hand against one of the most sacred sites in Judaism, Donald Trump on Monday became the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall in the disputed city of Jerusalem. Wearing a black skullcap, he paused in front of the holiest site where Jews can pray, then placed what appeared to be a written prayer or note between its stones, as is custom.SPONSORTrump was not accompanied by any Israeli leaders during the hugely symbolic visit.Allowing them to do so could have led to accusations that Washington was implicitly recognizing Israel's unilateral claim of sovereignty over the site, which would break with years of US and international precedent.Security was tight, with the usually bustling Old City, where the Western Wall is located, essentially on lockdown and the plaza leading to the site cleared.As Trump's convoy of dozens of cars entered the square around 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), armed security forces were positioned on nearly every building nearby as well as on the outer wall of the Old City.In the nearby Jewish Quarter, barriers had been erected to make viewing the square impossible from ground level, and some residents said they had been told not to go onto their roofs overlooking the Western Wall.Simon, a 20-year-old American studying in a nearby Jewish seminary, said he was ""excited"" by Trump's visit but disappointed he would not see him.Around a dozen ultra-Orthodox Jewish men had crammed into a tiny terrace on top of one house looking over, seemingly having been granted permission.Share this story!Visit and follow our website: Duterte Hot News© Duterte Hot NewsSource: #http://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/05/23/17/trump-becomes-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-western-wall",Trump becomes first sitting US president to visit Western Wall

"It’s been five years since Idle No More was elevated into the Canadian conscious.Through the work of social media and in particular the hashtag #IdleNoMore, Indigenous peoples we’re able to connect with each other and mobilize in cities and towns across the country.The images of Indigenous people drumming, holding hands, and round-dancing in malls etched their way into the minds of Canadians who had forgotten about the aboriginal peoples.Years later, the founders continue to speak up for Indigenous sovereignty, the land and water.CBC Indigenous asked the four founders about the movement.Nina Wilson, Kahkewistahaw First Nation, Treaty 4Who came up with the hashtag?Jessica Gordon. We were all sitting around, thinking how can we mobilize? What do we need to do? We were talking about how to get in motion. She just said, “We need to get off our asses and quit being idle. We can’t be idle no more.” And we sat there and thought about that. There we go, that’s how the name came up.What was it like watching the flash mobs (round dances) online?My son and sister had a computer, and he said you have to look at these videos. I started looking at the flash mobs, and I was like wow! I started to cry. I couldn’t believe it. I knew something was going on, but I just didn’t have time to see the depth of what was happening. When I saw it, I was just stunned.How Idle No More sparked an uprising of Indigenous Peoples1:37What do you think are the long term impacts of the movement?I think that our people have been silenced for a very, very long time. As soon as you go to school, you’re learning something. It’s almost like we want to fight for something. We stick up for the underdog. And as soon as we can, we’re practising social justice. It’s built into our DNA to defend and protect.How proud are you of what happened?I’m super proud. I love our people. I love what everybody did. Even the things that were no good to each other. At least it’s out there. And at some point we’re going to get to it. We’re not so isolated any more.Sylvia McAdam, Big River First Nation, Treaty 6What do you think are the long term impacts of the movement?I don’t think Canada will ever quite be the same again, because now [the government is] careful, they’re thinking about Treaty, Indigenous sovereignty, nation to nation, meeting the TRC recommendations, UNDRIP [United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] — this is unheard of if you explored that landscape 10 years ago. But the issue of land is unresolved.They have to follow the colonial agenda — if they began to talk about land and abolishing the doctrine of discovery which gives them that fictional title to Indigenous land — then they have no jurisdiction. They don’t wanna go there. These colonial governments they don’t want to go there, because they’re profiting and benefiting [from] the extraction of resources without having to answer to the biggest elephants in the room — the Indigenous titleholders of the land.Canada is posturing all the wonderful wording, but reconciliation, UNDRIP, all these things don’t mean anything when our Treaty terms and promises are not enforced.Today is the second anniversary of the Idle No More movement. (Nadya Kwandibens/Red Works/ARP Books)Do you think the movement lives on?When our young people are asked by industry, and young people are answering, “clean water, clean land, uncontaminated air.” I think that’s when it lives on. For the future, I envision our Indigenous nations rebuilding and revitalizing the laws that were here and are still here and the languages and the cultures and the repatriation of our lands. The critical component here is land.To the young people, I say, never believe the colonial narrative that we ceded and surrendered our lands. We never did.Jessica Gordon, Pasqua First Nation. Treaty 4.How much of an impact do you think social media had on the movement?Social media — that’s where it started, very much had to do with the start of the movement, maintaining movement. That’s how it got so big. Without it I don’t know how big it would’ve really got.What do you think are some of the failures?Failures — the biggest thing would be our need to decolonize from the way we think things ought to be done. The different levels of strategies and tactics used. Respect has to be all across the board. Inclusiveness of everyone’s various forms of tactics to do what they need to do for the movement.Clockwise from top left, Nina Wilson, Jessica Gordon, Sheelah McLean and Sylvia McAdam are among the 100 leading global thinkers of 2013 chosen by Foreign Policy magazine. (Foreign Policy )Do you think that the movement still lives on?Yes. A lot of people use it to motivate themselves and to feel, share in solidarity. They know they’re not the only ones out there. Idle No More is still there, still strong — people are finding different ways to use the movement and empower themselves and others.Sheelah Mclean, Saskatoon, anti-racism educatorWhat was it like to witness it take off like it did?I think we were all completely blown away by how beautiful it was to see a movement spread across Canada, and then globally so quickly…. The reason that it was so powerful is because everybody was a leader, everybody was working in the movement. Everybody was a part of it. That’s what makes the movement so beautiful, and so special today.Drawn to the sound of the drum, people gather at the New Year’s Eve round dance at Portage and Main in Winnipeg. (Eman Agpalza / ARP Books)What would you do differently?I think that the only thing that I could speak to, is there could have been more work on the part of white settlers and non-Indigenous people to get involved with the movement. I think sometimes people we’re discomforted by an Indigenous-led movement that focused on Indigenous rights.How proud are you of what happened?I’m amazingly honoured and proud to be a part of a movement like this, led by Indigenous women and two spirit people, supported by so many Indigenous men.","5 Years after Idle No More, founders still speaking out  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"The leaders of France and Israel sparred verbally Sunday over the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, while new violence rippled across the region following the move by U.S. President Donald Trump.In Jerusalem, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard, seriously wounding him in the first attack in the volatile city since Trump’s pronouncement on Wednesday. In Beirut, scores of Lebanese and Palestinian demonstrators clashed with security forces outside the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy, and Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo demanded that the United States rescind the decision.The move upended decades of U.S. policy, and a longstanding international consensus, that the fate of Jerusalem be decided in negotiations. Israeli and Palestinian claims to the city’s eastern sector form the emotional core of their conflict, and Trump’s announcement was seen as siding with the Israelis and has drawn wide international criticism.At a meeting in Paris with Israel’s visiting prime minister, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned recent violence against Israelis. But he also expressed “disapproval” of Trump’s decision, calling it “dangerous for peace.”“It doesn’t seem to serve, in the short term, the cause of Israel’s security and the Israelis themselves,” Macron said.Protesters take cover from tear gas fired by riot police during a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. (Bilal Hussein/Associated Press)He urged Israel to freeze its construction of settlements on occupied lands and called for other confidence-building measures toward the Palestinians.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called Trump’s decision “historic,” said Israel has maintained its capital in the city for 70 years and the Jewish connection to Jerusalem goes back 3,000 years.“Paris is the capital of France, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,” he said. “We respect your history and your choices. And we know that as friends, you respect ours.“I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we move toward peace,” he added.Israeli PM bound for BrusselsThe exchange between the two allies set the stage for what could be a tense meeting Monday for Netanyahu with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. The Jerusalem issue and the moribund peace process are expected to be high on the agenda.Last week, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned that Trump’s decision “has the potential to send us backward to even darker times than the one we are already living in.”She also warned that Trump’s “move could diminish the potential role that the United States could play in the region and create more confusion around this.”Protesters are seen near the U.S. Embassy in Awkar in east Beirut. (Mohamed Azakir/Reuters)The meeting could be a precursor for what seems to be an emerging rift between Israel and the U.S. on one side, and Europe and the Palestinians on the other.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Trump’s decision has in effect disqualified the U.S. from continuing in its role as the traditional mediator of peace talks. The Palestinians have spent recent days trying to rally Arab and broader international opposition to the decision.Abbas declines meeting with PenceAfter Abbas political adviser Majdi Khaldi said Saturday that the Palestinian president won’t meet with Vice-President Mike Pence when he visits the region this month, a spokesperson for Pence said Sunday it was “unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region.”EU leaders, including Macron, have reiterated support for establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Trump has said he would support the idea if both sides endorse it — effectively giving Israel a veto over any peace proposal. Netanyahu’s government is dominated by opponents to Palestinian independence. Trump’s Middle East team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been working for months on a peace plan but has not yet released it.Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the area to its capital in a move that was not internationally recognized. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.East Jerusalem is home to Judaism’s most sacred site, as well as key holy places for Christians and Muslims, and these conflicting claims have erupted into deadly bloodshed in the past.A senior U.S. official appealed to world leaders, especially in the Middle East, to calm regional tensions.Acting Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield told Arab journalists that Trump’s pronouncement was merely a “recognition of simple reality” that Israel’s government already is in Jerusalem.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, flanked by Vice-President Mike Pence, on Wednesday. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press)He said the U.S. was not prejudging final-status negotiations about the city’s final borders and expressed hope that world leaders understand the U.S. is committed to moving forward with a peace plan he expects to be unveiled in the new year.“This is a question of choice: Do leaders choose to speak to their peoples, to their regions in terms that reflect reality or in terms that incite or inflame?” he said. “We hope it’s the former.”‘Days of rage’The Palestinians staged three “days of rage” after Trump’s dramatic announcement, with clashes breaking out in flashpoints across the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and Gaza militants firing rockets into Israel. Four people in Gaza were killed. In the West Bank, there were dozens of injuries, but no deaths.There were indications that Sunday’s stabbing at the Jerusalem bus station was motivated by Trump’s move, although police did not officially confirm it.They said the attacker was a 24-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli media identified him as Yassin Abu al-Qarah, who posted on his Facebook page in recent days about Jerusalem, saying “our blood is devoted” to the holy city. Comments on his profile called him a hero for the alleged attack.Police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said the guard sustained a serious wound to his upper body and the attacker was apprehended.Palestinian youths also clashed in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas.Protesters hold a rally Sunday outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta to condemn the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (Darren Whiteside/Reuters)In Beirut, Lebanese security forces broke up the protest outside the U.S. Embassy after demonstrators pelted them with stones. After a rowdy start, the protest drew several hundred people and became more peaceful, with demonstrators chanting and singing.Clashes resumed in the afternoon, with security forces chasing and arresting a handful of protesters and lobbing tear gas. Lebanon is home to 450,000 Palestinian refugees, nearly 10 per cent of the population.About 10,000 people also rallied Sunday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.Similar protests, mostly organized by the Islamist Prosperous Justice Party, or PKS, also were held in many other cities in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country.Arab foreign ministers criticalIn a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, Arab foreign ministers demanded the recognition decision be rescinded and urged the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Trump’s decision. They acknowledged that Washington would most likely veto it.If the U.S. vetoes such a resolution, the Arabs would seek a similar resolution in the UN General Assembly, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Malki told a news conference in Cairo.With few options for the Palestinians, and the Arab world preoccupied by other crises, Arab willingness to press the issue may be limited. In Paris, Netanyahu talked about his quiet but improving relations with Arab countries that look to Israel as an ally against Iran.“There is in this a blessing, because this could help pave the way to an ultimate peace between us and our Palestinian neighbours and between us and the rest of the Arab world,” he said.Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, defended Trump’s move.“For those who want to say this is a bad idea, I’ll tell you: Ask us five or 10 years from now if you still think it’s a bad idea. Because I really do think this is going to move the ball in the peace process,” she told CNN’s State of the Union.","Israeli, French leaders tangle over Trumps Jerusalem decision  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"Two men, different provinces, the same life-changing surgery, yet one has to pay out of pocket and the other is covered by the public health-care system in what some call Canada’s medical “postal code lottery.”Peter Pawlik, a hearing-impaired Calgary man, is travelling to Austria to get a life-changing medical device surgically implanted that will help him hear clearly for the first time. Because the Alberta government won’t pay for the surgery, his retired parents are footing the $50,000 bill.It’s a trip they wouldn’t have to take and a cost they wouldn’t have to bear if their son lived in another province.Peter Pawlik, right and father George pause to take a selfie on their journey to Austria, where Peter will undergo surgery to receive a Bonebridge hearing system. (Peter Pawlik)“I’m old and I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I can’t leave him knowing there is something somewhere which can help him,” father George Pawlik told Go Public in an interview from his home before he left the country with his son.Been wronged? Contact Rosa and the Go Public teamThe Pawlik family tried for years to get surgery in Alberta for a Health Canada-approved bone conduction implant doctors say could restore Peter’s hearing to “almost normal.”The 35-year-old was born without ear canals and underdeveloped ears: conditions called bilateral atresia and microtia.George Pawlik packs for the trip to Austria, where his son will receive a surgery to improve his hearing. (Michael McArthur/CBC)He has been diagnosed with several mental health issues, which his psychiatrist links to his inability to hear clearly.His father says Peter is depressed and feels isolated, and that he can’t work, shies away from social contact, and didn’t want to be interviewed.George Pawlik says navigating the Canadian health-care system has been frustrating, and that the family faced delays and received conflicting information even when they offered to pay for the surgery themselves.Eventually, they gave up and booked the surgery overseas. “If something is possible to do, we have to do it,” Pawlik said.Alberta Health tells Go Public the last time it looked at insuring this type of implant was in 2013 when it decided there was “a lack of evidence that these implants were safe and effective.”Half of the provinces in Canada did their own reviews and decided the implants should be publicly funded.Canadians have to live in a province for more than three months before they are covered by medicare there.Different province, different systemRoss Weiss lives in Saskatchewan. He has the same condition as Peter Pawlik in his left ear and in 2015 he had the same surgery. The province of Saskatchewan paid for it.Ross Weiss of Saskatoon had Bonebridge implant surgery in 2015 and says the improvement to his hearing has been ‘a life changer.’ The external audio processor is worn above the ear, magnetically attached to the bone conduction implant which was surgically embedded in his skull. (CBC/Chanss Lagaden)“It’s not fair. Everybody should have access to something of this nature because it is a life-changer,” Weiss told Go Public.“I’m very happy to live in a province that does cover the surgery.”Physicians frustratedDr. Vincent Lin, an Ontario head and neck surgeon, says Alberta should revisit its decision not to fund the surgery. Ontario pays for the surgery, and Lin has done more than 80 operations to implant Bonebridge hearing devices in the last few years.Dr. Vincent Lin, a head and neck surgeon at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, holds the part of the Bonebridge hearing system that is surgically implanted in patients’ skulls. He has performed the surgery about 80 times. (CBC/Ivan Arsovski)“There’s been numerous studies … where it’s been freely available for years now, where it shows that Bonebridge has a huge advantage for patients with this type of hearing loss,” Lin said from his Toronto clinic.He says patients who would benefit from the implant have to go without if they can’t afford the surgery in provinces where it’s not covered and that is an “ongoing frustration with physicians, in many many fields.”Medical ‘postal code lottery’Health-care advocate Adrienne Silnicki says she hears stories like Peter Pawlik’s all the time.Adrienne Silnicki, national director for policy and advocacy at the Canadian Health Coalition, says hearing devices are just one of many areas of Canada’s health-care system where covered services and devices vary widely among the provinces. (David Richard/CBC)“It’s not just for hearing devices. It’s for pharmaceutical and dental care and vision, all of these pieces of the body that we left out of the Canada Health Act,” said Silnicki, who is the national director for policy and advocacy at the Canadian Health Coalition.Medical devices and medicines are approved by Health Canada, but it’s up to the provinces to decide what they will or won’t cover.“The postal code lottery is a perfect way of describing it. We have this patchwork of systems where people are trying to access services, but they may not be able to access it in their province.”Silnicki points out the “great divide” between “have and have-not provinces.” The ones that have more money to spend on health care sometimes offer more procedures, but she says it’s not just about funding but about using money they have more wisely.Peter Pawlik’s current hearing system, which he’s used since childhood, requires him to wear a headband and it only gives him limited hearing. (George Pawlik)A new Canadian Institute for Health Information study found 30 per cent of medical care in Canada is unnecessary and wastes health-system resources that could be put to better use.Silnicki would like to see the federal government work with the provinces and territories to ensure all Canadians have the same access.Peter Pawlik’s surgery is scheduled for Jan. 8. His retired parents will have a big bill to deal with, but his father says it will be worth it if his son’s hearing improves.“Peter was talking all the year about this, and this is first time that he has some sparks in his eyes, that he was believing that something would change in his life,” his dad said.",Some patients pay thousands while others nothing at all in medical postal code lottery  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

We could sense discrimination in this event, huh?Nieto emphasized that journalist like Tagala is one of the reasons why the people no longer trust the media.“Yung mga journalist tulad ni Tagala ang lalong sumisira sa mga reputasyon niyo” –NietoThis is Nieto’s Facebook post:",ABS CBNs Journalist Don Tagala Harrased & Disrespected Presidential Spouse Honeylet Avancena

"Houston Rockets guard James Harden drives to the basket on Portland Trail Blazers guard Evan Turner during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Portland, Ore., Saturday, Dec. 9, 2017. (AP Photo/Steve Dykes)PORTLAND, Oregon—The NBA’s hottest team has found a home on the road.Houston won its ninth consecutive game after James Harden scored 48 points and the Rockets rallied from 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 124-117 on Saturday night.The Rockets, who trailed for most of the game, won their eighth consecutive road game, running their season road record to 12-1. It is Houston’s best road start since the 1996-97 season.Harden hit 16 of 29 shots and grabbed eight rebounds, while Chris Paul scored 24 points and Trevor Ariza had 13 for Houston. The Rockets’ 20-4 record is the best by percentage in the NBA this season.“We’re riding high right now. That’s great. We know we’ll have some bumps. We have a lot of things to figure out, but we just keep getting better and grinding it out,” Houston coach Mike D’Antoni said.Houston took a good punch from Portland, which was trying to end a three-game home court losing streak. Damian Lillard tied a franchise record with nine 3-pointers and scored 35 points, while C.J. McCollum had 28 for the Blazers (13-12).“It was disappointing to lose. . We had a lot of good efforts from a lot of different players. It was good to be in a game at the end against a really good team,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said.Houston hasn’t had a close game in a while, particularly with Paul returning to action from an early season knee injury. That changed Saturday as Portland built a 98-84 lead after three quarters, though Lillard started the fourth quarter with an ice bag on his right foot after limping to the bench.Houston went to a small lineup, and punished Portland’s defense with 1-on-1 offense. The Rockets hit 15 of 18 shots, and Harden and Paul combined to score 25 of the team’s 40 fourth-quarter points.“Me and James were talking about how cool it was. I went a few times and then he got to go a few times. It was fun that we got to play off of each other like that,” Paul said.Harden went 6 of 7 during the fourth quarter, including five layups.“We went small and they had to adjust to us . once they did that, we had shooters on the court and the lane was wide open. So it was layup, layup, layup, 3-ball,” Harden said.With Lillard’s foot on ice, Houston launched a rally, pulling to 103-98 when Lillard returned with 7 minutes remaining. But the Rockets had momentum, and took a 110-109 lead on Ariza’s 3-pointer.The Rockets never trailed again, outscoring Portland 14-6 during the final 3 minutes.“It took everything we had to beat them,” D’Antoni said.The Blazers, eager not to finish a home stand 0-4, were aggressive early, as Lillard hit two 3-pointers but also drew two fouls during the first 3 minutes. Midway through the first quarter, Lillard stepped in front of Paul and earned a charging foul, touching off a battle of words that resulted in technicals to Portland’s Meyers Leonard and Paul.Lillard’s 3-pointer gave Portland its largest lead of the first half at 57-46, but Houston outscored the Blazers 16-5 during the final 5:37 to pull even at 62 at halftime.Houston piled up a big edge at the free throw line, making 34 of 42 shots, while Portland took only 12 free throws, making nine.“The disparity was ridiculous,” Stotts said.","James Harden scores 48 points, Rockets win 9th in row  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"The gift of travel is one of the best things parents can give their children to help them see the world and grow into well-rounded adults.Not only would it help them widen their horizons, traveling would also allow them to see and experience what’s out there and expand their awareness of all the possibilities life has to offer.This holiday season, traveling is also the best way to teach kids the value of sharing and giving.AirAsia, in partnership with World Vision, celebrates the season of giving through a joint Christmas initiative called “See the World,” an awareness building and fundraising effort for the benefit of underprivileged Filipino children.From Dec. 1 to 31, every seat booked done in the Philippines with AirAsia is equivalent to a P5 donation to World Vision Philippines.“’See the World’ is a worthwhile project that celebrates the value of giving and haring,” enthused captain Darren Adrian Acorda, chief pilot for operations, AirAsia. “The collaboration between AirAsia and World Vision represents our commitment to always extend a helping hand to the communities we serve.”Lifestyle Feature – Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1As a global brand, AirAsia is honored to partner with World Vision, an international relief, development and advocacy organization, which shares the same commitment and passion in helping and empowering communities.“See the World” aims to raise at least P1 million to provide sponsorship program for many children as direct recipients across the country.“The collaboration between AirAsia and World Vision represents another step forward in our commitment to the philosophy that no corporation can live apart from the community it serves,” said Pete Chareonwongsak, regional chief operating officer, AirAsia. “It’s one thing to run a business, it’s another to run an organization that directly impacts communities.”Well, AirAsia is not new when it comes to giving hope.“We were there after typhoon Yolanda struck Tacloban. AirAsia was the first one to fly in just when the runway was cleared,” recalled Capt. Acorda, the pilot in command of that flight. “We transported passengers — all covered in mud — for free.”AirAsia also conducted relief operations when a strong earthquake hit Tagbilaran.“AirAsia will always extend a helping hand to the communities we serve,” added Chareongwongsak.A worthwhile partnershipIt’s the first time for World Vision, which is now in its 60th year, to have an airline partner that will help them spread joy and cheer this Christmas season.“Through this initiative, we can ensure that every peso that will be donated to World Vision will help a lot of underprivileged Filipino children attain their dreams,” said Rommel Villafuerte, national director, World Vision Philippines.Aside from the fundraising efforts, “See the World” will also feature inspiring stories of children from impoverished communities around the country whose lives have changed and caused other children and communities to aspire for better living.“I’m such a cheeseball when it comes to this because I grew up in poverty,” shared singer/songwriter Quest, a World Vision ambassador. “I was just fortunate that my grandma was able to raise us well.”Quest, who came from a dysfunctional family, didn’t think twice when World Vision asked him to sponsor a child.“I was so honored because that’s my chance to give back. All throughout my life, I’ve been receiving help from my relatives and friends. Now’s my time to give back,” he enthused.For singer Christian Bautista, who has been a World Vision ambassador for more than 10 years now, working with World Vision opened his eyes to the realities of life.“Not all of us are born blessed. There are families out there who couldn’t even make both ends meet. My aunt introduced me to World Vision. She told me that for less than P100 a day, I could actually send a child to school. Well, I could give up a cup of designer coffee for a child in need anytime,” enthused Bautista.Bautista, together with the Mandaluyong Children’s Choir, performed well-loved Christmas carols during the launch of the “See the World” campaign at H20 Hotel in Manila.AirAsia and World Vision are expecting to raise P1 million until Dec. 31, but Chareonwongsak believes that AirAsia will exceed that amount.“I hope that this partnership is something that we just do during the Christmas season when everyone’s feeling a little charitable. This is one undertaking we would like to extend throughout and beyond today’s event,” added Chareonwongsak.Through AirAsia and World Vision’s “See the World” campaign, we can all have that chance to touch each other’s hearts and celebrate Christmas in a different way.* * *Keep updated and find out more about “See the World” through #AirAsiaWorldVision and #SeeTheWorld hashtags.",AirAsia and World Vision let you See the World and help a child  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"On Tuesday, June 27 , 2017, 5 people were found dead inside their house at North Ridge Royal Subdivision in Bulacan . The heinous crime was dubbed the Bulacan Massacre . The person who found them was Dexter Carlos Sr ., a security guard working at a bank in Makati and one of the victim’s husband. According to Dexter, he arrived home at around 8:45 am from his nightshift job but was surprised when no one opened the gate for him. He then climbed the gate only to see his mother-in-law, wife, and children massacred in their home.On June 28 , one of the suspects of the Bulacan massacre, 26-year-old Carmelo Ibanez , was arrested. Following his apprehension, he confessed to committing the heinous crime.Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr. , Bulacan police director, asked him why he did such a thing. Ibañez, a construction worker, said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN:“Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok.”Of the 5 victims of the Bulacan massacre, 2 women were r*ped by Ibañez and his two other companions, Tony and Inggo .According to Ibañez, the three suspects collectively did P150 worth of shabu during their drinking session before they decided to go to the Carlos residence to murder the people living there. When asked why they also killed the children, he simply said he didn’t know that there were any. He said:“Hindi po namin alam na may bata doon, ano na po kasi sa droga… Iyung mga bata, nakaka-meet ko rin po iyun. Minsan po kasi, nanood iyun sa kabila, sa ano ng ate ko, bahay.”He then asked the family to forgive him for what he had done. Ibañez said:“Ako po ang pumatay sa kanilang lahat. Nagsisi po ako sa ginawa ko po. Sana po ay mapatawad po ako kasi po lulong po ako sa droga saka po sa alak po. Pasensya na po kayo.”Watch ABS-CBN’s full interview with the suspect below:",Trip-Trip Lang: Bulacan Massacre Suspect Confesses to Killing All 5 Victims!
"“They are alive, you talk to them and tell them they would end up in a very serious situation if they continued (involvement in drugs),” the President said referring to drug suspect on the lists.The President stated that the priests had done nothing to help him in his campaign against drug, instead they “easily condemn” it. On the other hand, the Church leaders have shown support for the anti-drug campaign but stated they are against the killings associated with it.President Duterte also asked Church leaders to talk to village chiefs. Village chairs, he said, were not in the frontline of this war on drugs because “40 percent of them are involved in drugs. You see? That’s how serious the problem is.”“We are now a narcostate. You ask why I did not tap the barangay captains (village chiefs)? I cannot trust the idiots anymore,” the President said.He stated he had to tap the military’s help in destroying drug factories and running after all drug suspects. He’s no longer trust the village chiefs because of the involvement of many village officials in drugs. But he emphasized that his order did not include killing the suspects.“You can ask the military or the police in Manila if I ordered them to (kill drug suspects). If anyone of them stands up and say I ordered them to kill the poor and the children, I would resign because that would make me a liar.”“That’s the truth,” he added.He said the Church would always find fault in his antidrug campaign because of what he said were irreconcilable positions on how to deal with the drug menace.“For them, it’s pity and not hatred,” the President said. “No response. But the law is not like that. It takes pity on you but at the same time punishes you by jailing you,” he said.He also said the war on drugs did not target the poor.“I am here to enforce the law,” the President saidsource inquirerIn the Philippines, the Church holds a strong power over the nation that their opinions and beliefs matter. They have been part in ruling the country. When Rodrigo Duterte became the President, the Church seemed to be on the opposite side. They questioned the President’s capacity especially now that the war on drugs is a top issue.The President is now challenging the Church to help him on his war on drugs by taking the “preemptive move” of convincing drug suspects to reform.During a dinner with reporters, President Duterte said he would provide the list of drug suspects to the priest and they, together with the Church Leaders could reach out to those who were on his list of drug suspects and talk them out of the drug trade.",The Church Should Help Prevent Bloodshed in War on Drugs says the President

"The taxi driver who was accused by Maegan Aguilar of stealing her guitar has been rewarded by LTFRB. Mr. Vinet Alforque Sr.'s honesty has been recognized by the board because it was not the first time the taxi driver did good to his passengers.Alforque's good deeds as a taxi driver came to the attention of LTFRB after a video posted by Raffy Tulfo In Action's Facebook page went viral. In that video, he appealed to singer Maegan Aguilar, daughter of Freddie Aguilar, to stop bashing him and his family on social media.Aguilar accused Alforque of stealing his valuables that she accidentally left on his taxi. Eventually, the guitar and a bunch of bowls was brought back to her with the help of the LTFRB and operator of Nimble taxi, the company where Alforque is a long time driver.Aguilar did not count herself fortunate enough for the safe return of her valuables and instead took to social media to post malicious messages on her account stating that the driver would not return her belongings if not for the LTFRB. She even said in one post that the taxi driver and his operator are having an affair.The said posts by the singer reached the family of Alforque prompting him and his wife to seek help from Raffy Tulfo's program on TV5 where both parties were given chance to talk via phone call. The actress would not retract her accusations against Alforque and even implied that she would continue to bash the taxi drive on social media unless Tulfo can make other netizens stop bashing her as well.The taxi driver and the singer did not come to an amicable settlement.Meanwhile, even before her dispute with the taxi driver reached Tulfo's program, the singer had already posted on social media that she's not afraid of Tulfo and that her father and the president Duterte are best friends. She might have also implied in that same post that the president owns the Tulfos.Watch the awarding ceremony for Mr. Vinet Alforque below:",Taxi Driver Who Was Accused By Maegan Aguilar Of Stealing Gets Rewarded By LTFRB
"U.S. President Donald Trump regaled a rally of supporters Friday night with a story about a disagreement with Canada’s prime minister, then sprinkled his tale with some questionable statistics about international trade.Trump told a partisan crowd in Florida that he and Justin Trudeau had a closed-door debate about trade balances.He described it during the part of his speech where he blasted bad trade deals as one of the reasons he won last year’s election, and reiterated his promise to either cancel or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.He lamented a $71 billion trade deficit with Mexico, then added that there’s also a deficit with Canada. That’s where he described his exchange with Trudeau — who apparently kept telling Trump the U.S. has no trade deficit with Canada.“I like the prime minister very much. Prime Minister Trudeau. Nice guy. Good guy. No, I like him. But we had a meeting… He said, ‘No, no, you have a trade surplus.’ I said, ‘No we don’t.’ He said, ‘No, no you have a trade surplus,”‘ Trump told the Florida crowd.Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Pensacola, Florida on Friday night. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)“(Trudeau) said, ‘I’m telling you that Canada has a deficit with the United States.’ I told my people — in front of a lot of people — I said, ‘Go out and check’.”He said his staff found Trudeau left out some key details, pertaining to trade in goods: “(Trudeau) was right. Except he forgot two categories: Lumber timber; and energy. Other than that, he was right. When you add them all together, we actually have a $17 billion deficit with Canada.”That’s not what his own government’s stats say.Statistics from the website of the office of the U.S. Trade Representative — the very office handling NAFTA negotiations — paint a portrait opposite to Trump’s. It says, of last year’s trade balance: “The U.S. goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $12.5 billion US in 2016.”That reflects a large surplus in trade in services of $24.6 billion, mitigated by a deficit in goods of $12.1 billion.Inaccuracy on Mexico deficit numberTrump’s figure on Mexico was also off by almost one-third: The USTR site says the deficit with Mexico last year was about $15 billion smaller than what Trump said, or $55.6 billion in 2016.A number of economists have also called trade balances a questionable measure of success. They note that the U.S. economy has had a strong year in 2017, while the trade deficit is growing, and that, in any case, fluctuations are partly pegged to swings in the price of imported commodities like oil.Trump has repeatedly threatened to begin pulling out of NAFTA, as a negotiating ploy. Mexico has said it would leave the negotiating table if he triggers NAFTA’s withdrawal clause, while Canada has not made such a threat.Trump told the Florida crowd: “We’re gonna hopefully keep NAFTA. But there’s a chance we won’t. And that’s okay.”​","Trump says Trudeau left out lumber, energy while talking trade numbers  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) political affairs chief Ghadzali Jaafar said the group’s forces have been helping evacuate civilians out Marawi city.This statement was made earlier this month as government troops battled against Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists.In a report by the Inquirer, the MILF spokesperson said that the humanitarian efforts of the MILF came after MILF Chief Al Haj Murad met with President Rodrigo Duterte on the evening of May 29 in Davao City.According to Jaafar, their group has been helping Maranaos escape the violence in the city long before the meeting with the president took place.“We escorted them out of their homes to nearby towns outside the city,” he said.Jaafar also confirmed that sometime during the siege in Marawi City on May 23 – MILF militias open fired at the militants who were trying to blow up the bridge in the aforementioned city.“With the President’s go-signal, our troops there have been instructed to help in bringing out of the city the remaining civilians,” Jaafar said.However, despite the shared history between the MILF and the Maute group, there seems to be no love lost between the two groups.The spokesperson said there was no executive order for MILF forces to fight alongside with government forces against the ISIS-aligned Maute terror group.As of writing, the group’s focus has solely been the rescue civilians who remained trapped in the city. They were told to save these civilians regardless of whether they were MILF relatives or not.Yesterday it was reported by GMA News, that rescue teams of both MILF and government volunteers would reenter the war zone. Both groups would take advantage of the military’s eight-hour ceasefire in order to recover the bodies of the slain.Assistant Secretary Dickson Hermoso of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process had made this statement.“Our mission is to retrieve warm bodies. Our volunteers from the MILF will go to the ground, knock on the doors at the houses there, use megaphones and use the local vernacular of Maranao to entice them (trapped civilians) and bring them to the safe zone.”The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced the eight-hour ceasefire last Sunday night to allow Marawi City residents to peacefully celebrate the end of the month-long Ramadan known as Eid’l Fitr.The ceasefire which began at 6 AM will end at 2 PM.Watch the viral video report here:",GREAT NEWS!

"It wasn’t supposed to end up like this.Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were designed to help us keep up with friends and share photos, to unite diverse people with distinct ideas, and democratize the way we discover new information. Instead, they’ve fostered the rampant spread of propaganda and untruths, enabled cyber bullying, and amplified social divisions.While these ubiquitous platforms have fundamentally changed the way billions of people around the globe connect and communicate, it’s arguable that this change hasn’t necessarily been for the better. And as the repercussions resonate with users the world around, it could signal the beginning of the end for the social media giants.A decade ago, the expectations of what social media could do were utopian and idealistic. According to Buzzfeed News Media Editor Craig Silverman, the hopes were that they would usher a new age of more human communication and bring about transformational change in every aspect of society. “Social media was supposed to be the layer on top of the internet that truly enabled people to connect globally, to democratize news and information, and to also unleash new ways of doing business.”Twitter brought people together from across traditional barriers in the early days, says Elena Yunusov. (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)And at first it worked “miraculously well,” says Elena Yunusov, the founder of digital marketing firm Communicable.In the early days of Twitter, she explains, the platform brought people together from across traditional barriers. Users had long conversations with people they might never have had the opportunity to engage with otherwise, discovering discussions through hashtags designed to make a given topic searchable and inclusive.“Facebook was interesting too,” says Yunusov. While Twitter was great for getting to know new interesting people, Facebook was “really was about keeping in touch with friends and family. Social networks thrived on creating connections and communities, and while it’s hard to imagine now, they didn’t push notifications, didn’t serve ads every other second, didn’t spam users.”But now, she says, “we see more research come out on the adverse effects on people’s mental health, memory, attention spans, and ultimately, productivity and human connection and basic ability to communicate with each other.”‘Stark misuse of social media platforms’And that psychological toll is just the tip of the iceberg. As Nick Bilton wrote in Vanity Fair, we’re now seeing mounting evidence social media platforms are “tearing society apart, being used as terrorist recruitment tools, facilitating bullying, driving up anxiety, and undermining our elections.”From election meddling to fake news to racist algorithms, the harm done by these seemingly innocuous social tools is profound and far reaching.“We have seen stark misuse of social media platforms for the spreading of deliberate and targeted disinformation,” says Katina Michael, a professor in the faculty of engineering and information sciences at the University of Wollongong and Editor in Chief of IEEE Technology and Society Magazine. “We have also witnessed consumer exploitation and calculated economic manipulation based on an individual’s documented traits and characteristics on social media.”From election meddling to fake news to racist algorithms, the harm done by these seemingly innocuous social tools is profound, and far reaching. (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)According to Michael, the algorithms being used to profile you based on what you post, comment on and share online are then used to sway your sentiment “and have purportedly been responsible for the Brexit vote, led to President Trump’s election victory, led to an increase in the polarization of people’s beliefs to extremes, and contributed to instability and citizen anxieties about the now and future.”For example, last year, the firm Cambridge Analytica, hired by the Trump campaign, used people’s Facebook data to build psychological profiles of them. Using data scraped from the social network, such as age, location, occupation and hobbies, as well as religion, income and voting history, the company claims to have been able to match specific voters with targeted campaign messages. That’s all thanks to how those people used Facebook.So how did things go so far astray from their idealistic origins?Scale plays a big part in how things veered off course. The bigger these companies grow, the harder it is to manage the vast number of people that use their sites, and the even larger amount of content that people create and share. As a result, software has become the arbiter of what is right and wrong as automated systems make decisions about what is and isn’t allowed on the platforms.Cracking down on fake news5:16Without human oversight or intervention, these platforms have been manipulated and abused by the people and organizations on them, says Silverman, who adds that “platforms like Facebook operate at a scale that is unheard of in human history, and so we are only now beginning to see the good and bad of what that means.”But while that unprecedented growth has been the cause of many of these platforms’ negative consequences, some claim the dark side of social media can be traced to its very origins.Anatoliy Gruzd, an associate professor at Ryerson University and director of research for the university’s Social Media Lab concurs, saying that “the roots of the current issues with social media can be traced back to the mid-90s, to when the first pop-up ads appeared on the internet. By choosing advertising as the vehicle to fund the growth of the web, we set the stage for the current issues.”‘Major changes are on the way’Facebook co-founder Sean Parker even admitted recently that the platform was designed to exploit a vulnerability in human psychology, and “consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible.”Roger McNamee, another Facebook investor, recently said: “Facebook has the largest margins of any company of similar size in the American economy. They’re functioning like a drug company without doing clinical trials.”While Gruzd says that more still needs to be done, he notes that “major changes are on the way.”“In the wake of the on-going election manipulation scandal, Facebook has already come out in support of some limited changes to the current political advertising laws,” says Gruzd. “Twitter, in the wake of all their abuse, trolling and ISIS propaganda problems, has slowly come around to making major changes to their platform.”Facebook co-founder Sean Parker admitted recently that the platform was designed to exploit a vulnerability in human psychology, and ‘consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible.’ (Alex Wong/Getty Images)According to a comment filed with the Federal Election Commission, Facebook has said that it supports measures to promote transparency in online campaign advertising, including requiring political advertisers to disclose who is paying for the advertisements.Twitter also announced that they will “clearly label” political ads, and regularly updates its terms of service to try to mitigate the platform’s rampant abuse and harassment. In their updated rules, Twitter claims that “everyone should have the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers,” a statement that echoes the early ideals of social media, despite how it has veered off course in recent years.Facebook has said that it supports measures to promote transparency in online campaign advertising, including requiring political advertisers to disclose who is paying for the advertisements. (Noah Berger/Associated Press)So is this the beginning of the end for the likes of Facebook and Twitter? Certainly, there’s more chatter these days about social media burnout and “digital detox” than there is buzz about people clamouring to join.Faced with ugly truths ranging from election manipulation to the spread of misinformation, Grudz says these companies “will have to shoulder much of the responsibility to ensure that their platforms are safe for users and advertisers,” which is a far cry from the hopeful origins of the social media platforms.So while the current crop of social media platforms may not be going the way of Myspace just yet, this could be a moment of reckoning, as they are forced to acknowledge that the tools they have grown into are not the idealistic ones they were first intended to be.",Rampant social media misuse puts future of popular platforms at risk  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"On Staurday, June 24, 2017, GMA News reported that Sen. Leila De Lima, vocal critic of President Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, was once again issued an arrest warrant that alleges she was involved in “the proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison during her term as Justice secretary.”According to Sen. De Lima’s legal counsel, Alexandra Padilla, the arrest warrant was issued on June 21, 2017 by Judge Amelia Fabros-Corpuz of the Muntinlupa RTC. The warrant also includes Jose Adrian Dera a.k.a. Jad De Vera.De Lima’s legal counsel is pushing for the arrest warrant to be dropped, seeing it as the weakest among the 3 drug cases that De Lima currently faces from the Department of Justice (DOJ).Senator De Lima is still currently under the custody of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in their custodial center located within Camp Crame. She was arrested and detained on February 23, 2017, also for drug charges. Judge Juanita Guerrero ordered her arrest.The DOJ accused De Lima and Dera of conspiring to extort money from Peter Co, an inmate in Bilibid. Co claims in an affidavit that Dera blackmailed him by detaining and threatening his niece, Sally. Co claims Dera received 2 out of the 5 million pesos that he extorted from the inmate. Dera also allegedly took 4 of Co’s vehicles and used them during Sen. De Lima’s 2016 campaign. Co adds that Dera received 3 million pesos from Co’s niece, which he used to finance Sen. De Lima’s campaign.In an interview with GMA, Padilla said:GMA News wrote:What do you think of this recent development? Share your opinion in the comments section.",JUST IN!

"Lost amid the furor over the Federal Communications Commission’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad decision to reverse net neutrality requirements is another, equally awful decision that has slipped through the cracks.In mid-November, the Commission decided to “re-think” it’s Lifeline program, which provides subsidies for broadband internet subscriptions to low-income Americans in cities and tribal regions around the country.The proposed reforms could significantly reduce the amount of aid that’s offered through the program, which provided a $9.25 monthly subsidy for broadband subscriptions ($25 for subscribers on tribal lands). As the Brookings Institute notes, the Lifeline program was the only initiative specifically aimed at making broadband and phone access more affordable.At a time when digital skills are an increasing necessity for success in education and the job market, cutting access for the Americans who are least likely to afford those services on their own seems like a singularly bad idea.The new FCC rules would stymie the $2.25 billion annual program in three ways.First, it could prevent re-sellers from offering subsidized subscription plans. Re-sellers are telecommunications companies who provide services but don’t own network infrastructure — they typically pick up the slack in areas where there’s little incentive for network providers to offer services. That decision, according to Brookings, has a special impact on people living on tribal lands who receive a $25 in extra subsidies through re-sellers.The proposals from the FCC would also consider instituting a national spending cap on the subsidy. Finally, the FCC is considering revoking national approvals for Lifeline service providers that have already been qualified.The rationale for Lifeline’s re-evaluation was the revelation of mismanagement at the program. Roughly $1.2 million of the program’s $2.5 billion in funding was being distributed to fake identities or to people who had died, according to an investigation by the General Accounting Office.Under the new rules the FCC would definitely get rid of much of the waste associated with the program — primarily by doing away with everything that makes the program effective.Originally launched by President Ronald Reagan as a way to provide phone services to low income households in the eighties, the program was expanded under the Obama Administration in 2016 to include broadband services as an acknowledgement of the centrality of the internet in modern American life (just as the phone was in the 80s).While the majority of the FCC supports the changes to the Lifeline program, the changes aren’t embraced unanimously. Two weeks ago Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn addressed the proposed changes to the program during a speech in South Carolina.“Connecting the unconnected is no easy task. Costs of just a couple dollars a month can be insurmountable for families that struggle to put food on the table each day. But what the FCC majority proposed to do earlier this month, is to take away no-cost service offerings, and eliminate the business model of 70% of providers in the current market without specifying where existing consumers will go,” the Commissioner said. “I would be hard-pressed to identify a recent FCC action with a more pointed attack on the economically disadvantaged, than this one.”Reducing the ability for low income households to access the internet is a terrible idea. It creates even more obstacles to a quality education for kids and limits the ability of adults to develop the skills they need to compete in the modern job market — or even apply for jobs in the modern era.Again, the perspective from the Brookings Institute is helpful. According to their report, even though 93% of Americans have access to broadband services, penetration rates are actually far lower. Indeed, given their estimates that roughly 37% of households in low income neighborhoods have poor subscription rates for broadband services.It may be that this problem of the subscription gap is even more acute, and more intractable than internet access. New technologies are increasingly making broadband access more available to remote locations. By contrast, service providers have little incentives to bring their services into communities that can’t afford to buy them.“In short, the Lifeline Program is in trouble,” Commissioner Clyburn said in her remarks last month, “making it incumbent on those who care about affordable access to work with providers, partner with state and local authorities and let the FCC know how their communities will be impacted if 70 percent of those who currently provide service to those most in need are forced out of the market.”",Net Neutrality isnt the only thing the current FCC is screwing up  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Midler is renewing an allegation of sexual misconduct against Geraldo Rivera, a day after Rivera called the news business “flirty.” In a tweet posted Thursday by Midler and confirmed by her publicist, the actress-singer called on Rivera to apologize for an assault she said occurred four decades ago. (Photo by Richard Shotwell, left, and Rich Fury/Invision/AP, File)LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bette Midler renewed an allegation of 1970s sexual misconduct against Geraldo Rivera on Thursday, a day after Rivera called the news business “flirty” amid Matt Lauer’s dismissal by NBC.In the tweet posted by the actress-singer and confirmed by her publicist, she included a video from the 1991 interview with Barbara Walters in which Midler made the allegation against Rivera.“Tomorrow is my birthday. I feel like this video was a gift from the universe to me. Geraldo may have apologized for his tweets supporting Matt Lauer, but he has yet to apologize for this,” Midler posted, adding the harassment-solidarity hashtag “#MeToo.”A representative for Rivera didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fox News Channel, which currently employs Rivera but didn’t in the ’70s, didn’t immediately comment on Midler’s post.In the clip, Midler hesitates in recounting what she alleges happened with Rivera during his visit to interview her in the early 1970s, saying it will get her in trouble. “Get in a little trouble,” Walters encourages her.After Rivera and a producer left their TV crew in another room, they “pushed me into my bathroom. They broke two poppers and pushed them under my nose and proceeded to grope me,” she said. “Poppers” is slang for the alkyl nitrites class of drugs.“I did not offer myself up on the altar of Geraldo Rivera,” said Midler, calling his behavior “unseemly.”After Midler tells Walters that she had no way of knowing “these things are going to come back to haunt you,” Walters suggests they discuss other subjects.Midler came to prominence at the start of the ’70s, which included the release of her debut album “The Divine Miss M.”Walters opened up the topic by asking Midler’s reaction to Rivera’s 1991 autobiography “Exposing Myself,” including what Walters called his account of a “torrid sexual affair” with Midler, whom he labeled “insatiable.”Midler smiles, saying she was glad the book runs counter to her image at the time of the interview as that of a “somewhat straight-laced” older lady.“The truth about it is I didn’t remember” such an affair, Midler said. “One thing I did remember is how I met Geraldo, and that was not funny,” she added, then recounted the alleged assault.On Wednesday, Rivera waded into the sexual misconduct crisis that has spread through media, politics and Hollywood and snared “Today” show Lauer, fired after allegations were reported by NBC and in more detailed form by Variety and The New York Times. In his first public statement, Lauer said he is “truly sorry” to anyone he hurt by his words and actions.Rivera tweeted that the issue is “so red hot right now there is no room for any thought or opinion but hang em high.” He added: “If News wasn’t (formerly) a flirty biz then how do we explain so many newsroom courtships that have led to happy marriages?”Rivera also suggested there was a “slight chance” that those making allegations were motivated by big money settlements.Responding to his statements, Fox News Channel issued a statement Wednesday, saying, “Geraldo’s tweets do not reflect the views of Fox News or its management. We were troubled by his comments and are addressing them with him.”Rivera apologized hours later, saying he “didn’t sufficiently explain that this is a horrendous problem long hidden” and “harassers are deviants who deserve what is coming to them.”Fox has dismissed two high-profile men over sexual misconduct allegations involving their behavior while at the news channel, host Bill O’Reilly in April and CEO Roger Ailes, who was fired in 2016 and died earlier this year.

"A University of Calgary team has flushed the competition with a project that sets out to convert astronaut poop into handy tools, while also cutting down on flying bags of feces masquerading as shooting stars.Schulich School of Engineering student Alina Kunitskaya, and Sam Wilton-Clark, a health sciences student, are part of the team that just brought back a gold medal from the International Genetically Engineered Machine Foundation’s giant jamboree in Boston.Their winning project was called Astroplastic: From Colon to Colony.Sam Wilton-Clark, left, and Alina Kunitskaya, students at the University of Calgary, used fake poop in their project, made from a recipe created by NASA. (David Bell-CBC/Submitted by Alina Kunitskaya)“There’s a huge issue with transporting materials to Mars. How do you account for everything astronauts might need over three years? Waste management is another huge issue and we thought maybe we will address both of those,” Kunitskaya told The Homestretch.Wilton-Clark explains the solution the group came up with.“We modified the DNA of an E. coli bacteria so that it would take acids out of the human poop and actually build a plastic out of it and then spit that plastic out so that we can use it to make tools.”The plastic is used by a 3D printer to create tools such as a wrench or screwdriver.The NASA-approved fake poop is altered to create white plastic pellets that can be used in a 3D printer to make tools such as a wrench or screwdriver. (Submitted by Alina Kunitskaya)They didn’t actually used human feces but in the process learned that NASA has an official recipe for fake poop, which includes yeast, cellulose, peanut oil and miso paste.“The tools won’t be smelly because by the time we get the plastic out of the system, it’s going to be dry and all the smelly components will be removed,” Kunitskaya explained.“The funny thing is, our synthetic poop that we made actually had a quite pleasing smell to it.”These Calgary students were not satisfied with No. 2. Their project took a gold-medal in a recent science competition in Boston. (Submitted by iGEM 2017 team)Wilton-Clark didn’t totally agree with that aromatic assessment.“It’s a smell only a mother would love,” he said.The project involved interviewing experts at the Canadian Space Agency and NASA and astronauts including Chris Hadfield and Robert Thirsk.Kunitskaya says if they can swap fake poop for real poop, it could save valuable room on the spacecraft and reduce the need to dispose of solid waste, which is currently just tossed out.Here’s a very special wrench.

After providing for his family in Marcos ‘ Letter of Instruction, the whole wealth derived from this was supposed to be given to the FILIPINO PEOPLE . This was the “MARCOS WEALTH” that some POLITICIAN and CHURCHMEN kept on saying was the:” ILL – GOTTEN ” Marcos Wealth..WHY THIS WEALTH HAS BEEN LABELED ” ILL – GOTTEN ” a little further along in our STUDY , that unti today is in MARCOS SECRET ACCOUNTS.– On April 9, 1973 Marcos said: “MY EARTHLY GOODS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE CUSTODY AND FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MARCOS FOUNDATION DEDICATED TO THE WELFARE OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE.”In his GRAND PLAN, MARCOS wanted to RE ESTABLISHED the former grandeur of MAHARLIKA and the whole region of SOUTHEAST ASIA , the former MALAYAN EMPIRE.In June 1983, Marcos appeared before the First World leaders in Toronto. He announced his plan to boost economy of the Southeast Asia Region by creating ASIAN DOLLAR. This would be backed up by the 400,000 metric tons of gold in Central Bank.The ASIAN DOLLAR , backed up by the two thirds of all gold in the world that was in the Maharlika. Would made the Maharlika money more valuable and stronger that the American dollar. This was his vision to raise Southeast Asia to be par with the rest of the first world countries.There is plenty of solid evidence of a program MARCOS worked on with American President Ronald Reagan, which referred to as the ABL ( ANG BAGONG LIPUNAN) program. Under this program some 250 sets of gold , documentation and related ABL currency were to be shipped to various countries around the world.—-WHAT BECAME OF THE REMAINING 400,000 metric TONS PERTAINING TO THE TAGEAN – TALLANO CLAN and where is it today?To this day, the 400,000 metric tons of GOLD are still in the CENTRAL BANK in East Avenue , Quezon City. NOBODY CAN MOVE it because Marcos insured it with the LLOYDS OF LONDON and its agents are guarding it.—-BUT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ITS EXISTENCE.—Not only have SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS of the Philippines failed to ACKNOWLEDGE the existence of the GOLD, they have CONSPIRED to keep this information from being KNOWN to the Filipino People.We assume this is because they have been working at ways to convert the GOLD for their own selfish gain, probably in conspiracy with the International Banking Cartel.Immediately after Ferdinand Marcos was REMOVED from the office by a U.S MILITARY helicopter , the NEWLY installed PRESIDENT CORAZON AQUINO , formed the PCGG- Presidential Commission on Good Government, PURPORTEDLY to go after the Marcos – ILL GOTTEN WEALTH.” IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CONSPIRATORS THAT THIS WEALTH SHOULD BE LABELLED ~~ILL – GOTTEN~~ even though, as has already been shown , MR MARCOS was in his OWN RIGHT the WEALTHIEST MAN on the face of the EARTH and had absolutely no need to take anything from anyone.A decision of the FEDERAL SUPREME COURT OF SWITZERLAND dated December 21,1990 said……”… By decision of May 29,1986 , the attorney general of District of Zurich accepted in principle to the legal assistance requested by the PHILIPPINES and invited all the banks of the City of Zurich to FREEZE IMMEDIATELY all the accounts, deposits or safes of the persons, companies or foundations ( of MARCOS) in the order….”THE ACCOUNTS WERE FROZEN at the request of the government of the Philippines and the PCGG has ensured they have remained FROZEN to this day.This is all a GRAND SCHEME OR SCAM. BLINDED Filipinos must keep repeating that MARCOS was a THEIF ( MAGNANAKAW) so that those HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of DOLLARS of Marcos Money will remain FROZEN and not be given to them for their use..Consequently, they MUST CONSTANTLY BORROW MONEY from International Monetary Fund( IMF) and World Bank ( WB) with SO MUCH INTEREST so that this COUNTRY WILL REMAIN A SLAVE and SHACKLED to the foreign powers.HISTORY will show that the money was not stashed away and inaccessible but AVAILABLE to truly deserving Filipinos.There was NOTHING SECRET about Marcos Accounts. These ACCOUNTS were ONLY MADE SECRET by some people in the government so that the PUBLIC would not know its REAL STORY.GOLD FOR GOLD , DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, this country , the Maharlika is the RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.During a talk show in U.S TV the week following the bombing of the New York Twin Towers, PRES BUSH was asked this question:WHICH IS THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TODAY ? With a smile he said : THE PHILIPPINES, Marcos knew it, but he could not talk.At the time they made sure that MARCOS would not longer talk. After kidnapping him from Malacanang , they put him in a golden prison in HawaiiAccording to Global Finance, the richest country in the world, based on gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing-power-parity (PPP) per capita, is Qatar, second Luxembourg, and third Singapore. The Philippines is ranked 118th.Watch the video below:",Public Trending
"I’ve heard blogging referred to a couple of times recently as a mixture between an art and a science. If this is true (and I think it is), there’s no ‘right way’ to approach blogging if you want to be successful. There are plenty of people who’ve done a great job of it though, and I thought it would be useful to learn from them.These 16 bloggers shared one important tip each for blogging beginners. No doubt, even if you’re not a beginner these tips will probably prove to be useful.1. Get ideas from your audienceCreate blog posts that answer the most interesting questions from people you engage with on social media. Dave Larson, founder of @tweetsmarterThis can be a great way to gather ideas of what topics people would most like to read about, which will help your blog grow! One of the best ways I’ve seen this in action is through blog comments or Tweets. In one example, here on FastCompany a lot of people requested a post that features more women entrepreneurs:Now, a few weeks later adding such an article where just women contributed and built great businesses was a big hit:2. Understand your audienceUnderstand your audience better than they understand themselves. It takes a lot of upfront research, and often means being a member of the very tribe you’re trying to lead – but it pays off. Brian Clark, founder and CEO, CopybloggerUnderstanding your audience better means you’ll have a better idea of what blog content will resonate with them, which is a good start when you get to writing blog posts.A great technique for doing this is to simply ask your readers first on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn with an engaging quote. If people respond well to it, than this is probably a great topic to write about. An example for this comes from Andrew Chen who famously “tests” his blogpost ideas on Twitter first.And so does Joel here at Buffer. Take this example from a recent Twitter post of his, where he simply tweeted one quote to see how well people liked a topic before he blogged about it:3. Write for yourself firstWrite for yourself first & foremost. Ignore the fact that anyone else will read what you write; just focus on your thoughts, ideas, opinions and figure out how to put those into words. Write it and they will come. Adii Pienaar, founder of PublicBetaAdii’s experience in writing for himself firstly has made a difference to his blog in ways he didn’t expect:Yes, since I’ve been writing for myself, I’ve found that I write more and I publish more often. I think though that the main reason for that is that I don’t decide whether to publishing something based on the traction / reception that the post will receive within my audience; instead if I want to publish something, I do so. For myself.4. Build your email listStart building your email list from day one. Even if you don’t plan on selling anything, having an email list allows you to promote your new content to your audience directly without worrying about search rankings, Facebook EdgeRank, or other online roadblocks in communications. Kristi Hines, freelance writer and professional bloggerWhen you’re asking readers to sign up for your email list, you might want to try experimenting with different language. Willy Franzen found that his subscription rate jumped 254% higher when he changed his call-to-action from “subscribe by email” to “get jobs by email”:Using this phrase more clearly tells Willy’s readers what they’re signing up for, which clearly worked well!5. Love your existing readersLove the readers you already have. A lot of bloggers get quite obsessed with finding new readers – to the point that they ignore the ones they already have. Yes – do try to find new readers but spend time each day showing your current readers that you value them too and you’ll find that they will help you grow your blog. Darren Rowse, founder of ProBloggerFocusing on your readers is a great way to get to know them better (see tip #2). I love the way Daniel Burstein describes blog readers’ expectations of you as a blogger:A blog is really two things. One, simply a piece of technology, a platform. But, two, it is a promise in the minds of most readers, who expect that the blog should have actual content with some elements of value that is hyper-targeted to their needs. Much like with a newspaper. Readers don’t just look at a newspaper as newsprint that is delivered on their driveway every morning. They look at it as valuable information about their city, where they live, and the things that they do.6. Focus on building an amazing call-to-actionI screwed up for years. I’d blog and blog. Some of my posts were doing very well on places like Hacker News, but I had such hard time getting return visitors. And very few people bothered to follow me on Twitter. Don’t rely on people to do the work to find your Twitter account. Don’t rely on them to do the work to find your details in a sidebar. People are blind to sidebars. Thanks banner ads! Finish your blog post with some kind of call to action to signup for an email list or follow you on Twitter. When I started doing this, I immediately increased my Twitter followers by 335% in the first 7 days. Nate Kontny, founder of DraftNate uses a simple call-to-action on his blog now, that looks like this:This particular technique we’ve also tested here on the Buffer blog and found it to work amazingly well to bring attention to other blog posts we’ve written, like this:or to Buffer product features, like this:7. Give stuff awayGive away free content that adds value to people’s lives “until it hurts” and they will love you and become loyal fans. Jeff Bullas, blogger and author of Blogging the Smart WayA great example of this is the research done by Incentivibe, who found that adding a giveaway contest pop-up to the bottom-right of their website led to 125% more email subscribers.8. Be consistentConsistency is one of the most important things that bloggers tend to forget. It’s much easier to lose your traffic than it is to build it up, so make sure you consistently blog. Neil Patel, founder of KISSmetricsA study by Hubspot showed that consistent blogging actually leads to higher subscriber growth rates:Over a two-month span, businesses that published blog entries on a regular basis (more than once a week) added subscribers over twice as fast as those companies that added content once a month.9. Give away your knowledgeDon’t be afraid to showcase what you know. Too many bloggers hold back the good stuff out of fear of giving away the “secret sauce.” There is no secret sauce in a world where everyone has high speed Internet access at all times. Today, you want to give away information snacks to sell knowledge meals. Jay Baer, author of YoutilityJay’s advice is to share the knowledge you have, rather than keeping it tucked away for a rainy day. Chris Guillebeau follows this advice by offering two free, downloadable PDFs to his readers. Chris also does what Jay calls giving away “information snacks to sell knowledge meals.” On both of the free PDF download pages, Chris markets his book on the right-hand side.10. Be true to your voiceStay true to yourself and your voice. People don’t care to follow sites so much as they care to follow people. Chris Pirillo, founder and CEO, LockerGnomeAnother blogger who advocates the importance of the writer’s voice is Jeff Goins. He says that your voice is the most important, yet over-looked part of blogging:Writing isn’t about picking the right topic; it’s about finding the right voice. What matters, what readers really resonate with, isn’t so much what you say, but how.11. Give it time – This is whyPlan to invest in blogging for a long time before you see a return. The web is a big, noisy place and unless you’re willing to invest more over a greater period of time than others, you’ll find success nearly impossible. If you’re seeking short-term ROI, or a quick path to recognition, blogging is the wrong path. But if you can stick it out for years without results and constantly learn, iterate, and improve, you can achieve something remarkable. Rand Fishkin, CEO of MozRand shared these great images with us from his wife’s travel blog, Everywhereist, which shows just how long it can take to see a return on your efforts:12. Give your email list priorityIf you’re blogging to create a business, a movement, or to support a cause, then you need to build an email list. It’s not an option. I don’t even consider my blog to be my community, my email list is my community. Caring about these people, writing for them, and delivering value to them should be your number one goal. James Clear, entrepreneur, weightlifter and travel photographerWhen the New York Public Library focused on growing email subscription rates, this simple home page design with information about what readers could expect to receive boosted numbers by 52.8% over a more complicated version with less information about the actual newsletter:13. Write catchy headlinesNo matter how great your content is, it won’t matter unless you have an amazing headline. People have a split second to decide if they should click on your post, and your headline will make them decide. The headline is also essential in making it easy and desirable for people to share your post. Keep your headlines SPUB: simple, powerful, useful and bold. Dave Kerpen, author and CEO of Likeable LocalSomething we do at Buffer is to test several different headlines for each of our blog posts to determine which ones works best. Here’s an example of what that might look like:You can read more about this particular approach in more depth here: A scientific guide to writing great headlines on Twitter, Facebook and your Blog14. Be YourselfThere isn’t one specific set of rules to be successful in blogging. When I started blogging, I had the opportunity to learn from experienced and successful bloggers in the industry. One of the best lessons I’ve learned from them is to simply be me. I didn’t have to be too “professional” or use “big words” to impress others. I had to simply be me. By being me, I enjoyed writing and the process more. It had me writing more than I usually would too. If you look at the the most successful writers like Seth Godin and Chris Brogan you’ll notice that they are different and unique in their own ways. Aaron Lee, social media manager, entrepreneur and bloggerMoz CEO Rand Fishkin agrees that telling your company’s story is important, as opposed to following a formula for successful blogging:Emotion and storytelling have been part of how we communicate with each other and inspire action for thousands of years.15. Keep it shortBiggest lesson I learned in my past year of blogging. Keep it in the 1–2 minutes read-time length. Derek Sivers, founder of Wood EggWorking out the best length for your blog posts can be tricky. You generally need about 300 words minimum to get indexed by search engines, but otherwise the length of your post is up to what you think feels best.Derek Sivers noticed recently that his shorter posts were much better received by readers and seemed to be shared more, unlike his longer posts:When I’ve written articles that were too long or had too many ideas, they didn’t get much of a reaction. When I read books, I often feel bad for the brilliant idea buried on page 217. Who will hear it? Stop the orchestra. Solo that motif. Repeat it. Let the other instruments build upon it. The web is such a great way to do this. Present a single idea, one at a time, and let others build upon it.According to this Chartbeat graph below, many visitors to your site won’t bother scrolling, and most visitors won’t read more than about 60% of what you’ve written. Keeping it short and sharp then, could be worthwhile.If you’re looking for a general guide to blog post length, Joe Pulizzi’s blog post, “A blog post is like a miniskirt” might be useful:A blog post is like a miniskirt. It has to be short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the subject.16. Make it worth referencing – here is how:One thing I always try to keep in mind before publishing a post is would anyone want to “cite” this for any reason? Just like interesting research is great because it leaves you with a fascinating finding or an idea, I like for my posts to be the same. That doesn’t mean relying on research, but simply making sure each post has an original lesson or actionable item, making it “citable” on the web. Gregory Ciotti, marketing strategist at Help ScoutOur very own Buffer co-founder Leo has written about a similar thing before:When writing a post, I get into a mindset to answer just this 1 question with a Yes: “Would anyone email this article to a friend?” It’s an extremely simple proposition. Yet, it has changed my writing completely. If I put myself into a reader’s head going through a post and seeing whether someone will say “Oh, this is interesting, John will really like this”, then I go ahead and publish it. It’s almost like an invisible threshold to pass. I need to improve the post until this level is reached. I will iterate, find more research, get more examples, until I can truly imagine this happening.I’m sure there are lots more great tips out there about building a blog.

"Doctor Ethel Pineda expressed her disappointment to former President Noynoy Aquino and former Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Janette Garin for not being careful in deciding if vaccinating 700,000 children of the controversial Dengvaxia vaccine would be safe.She said that the former administration still pushed the program despite of the doubts of several health experts about the vaccine which made by Sanofi Pasteur, a French pharmaceutical company.According to her, the drug was not yet proven 100% effective in 2016, however the former administration still distributed it to thousands of people in different parts of the Philippines.She also said that the vaccine was used in a wrong way which resulted to a wasted opportunity to help thousands of Filipino people against the deadly dengue virus.“It is lamentable to see something that has been a product of so much research and studies, with the noble intention of helping people, used haphazardly so it does harm instead. What a waste.” Dr. Pineda said in her Facebook post.“If Aquino and Garin really had in their hearts the welfare of the Filipinos, they would have been more careful. They should have listened to experts and be more circumspect and cautious.” she added.Thousands of families became alarmed after the Sanofi Pasteur on Wednesday admitted that their latest clinical data showed could make the disease worse in people who had not previously infected with the virus.World Health Organization also clarified that they never recommended to contries to introduce the controversial Dengvaxia vaccine to their immunization programs.“WHO’s position on the dengue vaccine was published in July 2016, based on recommendations of the strategic group of experts on immunisation which met and published preliminary advice in mid-April 2016,” WHO said.According to the Department of Health, 733,000 children were already vaccinated by the controversial Dengvaxia.Several deaths of children due to severe dengue were also reported in different parts of the Philippines.Source:",Doctor says Dengvaxia scandal is a proof that former Pres. Aquino and former Sec. Garin didnt prioritize Filipino welfare

"Senator Antonio Trillanes IV has received heavy criticism and bashing after being stood up by Stephen Sackur in BBC Hard Talk interview.With a moral and political reputation at stake, it seemed only Rappler was trying to salvage Trillanes walk of shame by posting an article spun to favor Trillanes.Rappler ran the headline “Trillanes to BBC anchor: Filipinos will soon realize ‘damage’ caused by Duterte” which focused on the controversial Hard Talk interview.Despite Trillanes’ obviously besmirched reputation after the BBC interview, Rappler still tried to angle its news report in a way that positively highlighted Trillanes’ viewpoint.Netizens took to social media to express their dismay at Trillanes’ interview with one of them posting:How long does it take to expose a lying braggart?BBC – less than an hourPhilippines media – cannot answer. Mouth stuffed with money.Rappler was also targeted by the ire of netizens for allegedly protecting the senator.One netizen said, “ladies and gentlemen, mga kababayan, this is what spinning to condition the minds of the people is all about. The entire world has seen the meltdown of the Senator yet Rappler sees it differently. This online new entity has taken the role of fault-finder in the Duterte presidency to the point of neglecting critical thinking, which is a very important aspect of Thought Leadership. I am amused.”As Rappler’s founder, Maria Ressa was bashed for her editorial choices that have led to Rappler seemingly trying to protect a staunch Duterte critic.Netizen Mike Acebedo Lopez posted Rappler’s article on Trillens’ BBC interview and wrote a caption saying, “most of us have seen the BBC interview, a grand display of feeblemindedness and a much-deserved paring down of the senate stooge, yet this is Maria’s Rappler’s takeaway. Pasintabi pero, sobra na, Maria Ressa…punyeta ka!”",Did Rappler tries to save Antonio Trillanes political career with biased news?
"Eighty-three-year-old monk Brother Albéric says that if you stacked all the cheese he’s made in his life, the pile would reach up to heaven.Every morning, the monk is in the kitchen at the Notre Dame des Prairies monastery near Holland, Man., by 8:30 a.m., crafting fresh wheels of fromage de la trappe — cheese in the Trappist style, made with unpasteurized milk. At that point, he’s already been awake for hours, after getting up at 3:30 a.m. to sing and pray with the four other elderly monks who are part of the Trappist order at the monastery.He’s in the dim cellar by 10 or 10:30, handwashing dozens of the 10-pound wheels in a special brine as they age, in silent, spiritual contemplation.He’s the last person in North America who makes the cheese using the traditional Trappist techniques — but he won’t be for very much longer.“For me, it’s the will of God,” the monk said. “I’m old, I’m tired, I [have] nobody.… It’s time to finish.”After 60 years, Brother Albéric is ready to stop making cheese, and he found a pair of Winnipeg chefs who say they want to take on his tradition.The five monks at Notre-Dame-des-Prairie Monastery are up before dawn most mornings to pray and sing together. (Samuel Rancourt/CBC)‘This cheese is alive’Married couple Dustin Peltier and Rachel Isaak have worked in Winnipeg kitchens for 20 years and 19 years respectively, and run a catering company called Loaf and Honey.Peltier stumbled upon Brother Albéric’s cheese through one of his suppliers six or seven years ago, he said. He liked the deep, dark, rich flavours of the unpasteurized cheese.“This cheese is alive,” Peltier said. “It’s got flavour, it develops, it’s got character because it hasn’t been pasteurized.”Later, he read an article about Brother Albéric’s lifelong devotion to the craft and he was intrigued. A year ago, he and Isaak started thinking seriously about taking on cheesemaking full-time, after a trip to the wineries and creameries in B.C.Dustin Peltier, left, and Rachel Isaak are preparing to start their own cheesemaking business in the tradition of the Trappist monks, taught by Brother Albéric. (Samuel Rancourt/CBC)Since then, Brother Albéric has been grooming the pair to begin their own practice, training Peltier in the monastery and instructing him to relay the information to Isaak, who isn’t allowed in the back of the monastery because she’s a woman.They’re building a cheese factory and cement “cave” to age the cheese just like the monk does in the rural municipality of Woodlands, just northwest of Winnipeg, and hope to have their first wheels ready for sale by mid-January. De Luca’s, a Winnipeg specialty food store, has already placed an order for 300 wheels per month and chefs from various restaurants have expressed interest, too, Peltier said.They’ve been instructed by the province to take a proper training course, offered in B.C., to produce the unpasteurized cheese, Peltier said.“It’s a little daunting and we get a little nervous but, you know, we’re excited about it and we feel it’s a passion thing for us,” he said.“This recipe dates back to the 1700s and Brother Albéric’s the last man in North America to make this cheese in this style, and we feel very honoured and kind of privileged that we get to do this and keep going and spread it.”Quality over quantityFor Brother Albéric, the handover has been a lifetime in the making.The Quebec native left his family and home just west of Montreal and entered the Trappist monastery near Oka, Que., when he was 16.Four years later, he started making cheese — because, he says, he didn’t have a choice. All the novices spent their mornings milking cows and making cheese. They used an unpasteurized recipe he says originated with 18th-century monks in Yugoslavia, which was shared with a French monk and finally passed on to the Quebec monastery as a Christmas gift in 1918.Brother Albéric washes each wheel of cheese by hand everyday. (Samuel Rancourt/CBC)Brother Albéric has been making it the same way ever since, he said, even though the Quebec monastery stopped making its own cheese decades ago. He volunteered to come to Manitoba in 1967 to help out the Prairie branch of the monastery, and helped establish a new traditional cheese factory to replace one that was destroyed in the 1950 Red River flood.Some European monasteries have altered the recipe to include pasteurized milk so they can sell the cheese on a larger scale, he said, but he doesn’t think much of the flavour.“The [pasteurized] cheese tastes [like] nothing, smell nothing. They lose the quality for the quantity to make some money,” he said. “I prefer to have a small cheese factory, not produce so much, and to have a good cheese than to have a big quantity of cheese tasting [like] nothing.”The cheese factory at the Notre Dame des Prairies monastery has been producing cheese for decades, but will stop soon. (Samuel Rancourt/CBC)As he got older, he started looking for someone to take up the mantle when he retired. Monastic leadership wasn’t interested, he said, and no young monks materialized to teach — and that’s where Peltier and Isaak came in.“We’ve got kids and bills to pay, and we feel this is a good way to set ourselves up. It’s a niche that … no one’s delved into and looked at,” Peltier said. “There’s a big demand for unpasteurized cheese.”The next stageWhen their cheese plant is up and running in Woodlands, Peltier and Isaak plan to make cheese in the cellar and sell jams, preserves and baked goods made from the leftover whey in a bakery at the front.“We’re not looking to take over anything or whatever. We want to keep it a niche, artisanal thing,” Peltier said.They haven’t pinned down a name for the cheese yet — fromage de la trappe is off the table because it’s associated with the monastery, and Brother Albéric told them they can’t name it after him, like they wanted to.But they’ve got a Winnipeg distributor, and they’re already planning meals for their catering business that incorporate the cheese. They’re also considering multiple flavours with local ingredients like mushrooms, fruit and beer.As for Brother Albéric, after a lifetime in the business, he said he’s ready to move on.“I really don’t care, because I know everything has to have an end,” he said.Peltier said he’s excited to start educating more Winnipeggers on the cheese and the tradition.“I’ve got to spend a lot of time with Brother Albéric. He’s 83 years old. He’s been in the monastery life since he’s been 16,” Peltier said.“To stay with someone and listen to him — and he’s been making cheese for 60 years, and he’s still passionate about it — you can’t help but kind of carry that on and take it on.”","The last Trappist cheesemaker: 83-year-old monk ready to retire, pass tradition to new hands  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"Admit it, most girls love makeovers, shopping for clothes and of course, surprises. That’s why most boyfriends never fail to surprise their girlfriends, especially on their birthdays. But what if inside a surprise comes another surprise? Isn’t it romantic? One man has done a very unique birthday surprise in Singapore with a romantic twist at the end.A loving boyfriend named Jensen wanted to surprise her girlfriend Evelyn on her birthday so he secretly arranged a vehicle to pick up Evelyn at her workplace on June 30th, 2014.Inside the vehicle was her boyfriend’s 1st surprise- a box with a stuffed toy inside and a sweet note from him.He wrote, “Hi Princess Evelyn, remember me? The Stitch you have always been hugging while in the car? I’m back for you! Your journey has just begun. Sit tight, relax, and have fun!”Evelyn was then brought to a salon. She had no idea that she will be given a complete makeover for free.After the makeover, Evelyn received another box with a note.“Take a look into our love journey. All the countries and memories we had been through. I want to walk on with you again to many countries and to fill our album with more love!”, Jensen wrote.This time, the box was filled with photos from their trips together.But it seems like Jensen’s surprises were endless. The lucky girlfriend was brought to a boutique full of decorations and personal mementos of the couple.Jensen recalled how he met Evelyn again in school.

"Grab may be in the process of raising a huge $2.5 billion investment round, with SoftBank, Didi and Toyota confirmed as participants, but Uber’s Southeast Asia-based rival has lost its head of engineering.Arul Kumaravel, VP of engineering at Grab, has left the company for personal reasons, according to a source. It’s not yet clear what his next plan is. Grab confirmed the departure.Kumaravel joined Grab’s Singapore office from Amazon, where he had been head of mobile development, in April 2015. He assumed the role as head of tech at Grab in August of that year following the departure then-CTO Wei Zhu, a former Facebook engineer who lasted just over a year in his role.Grab said it has promoted “long-standing engineers as heads of engineering” to fill the gap, with Raman Narayanan, a veteran Microsoft engineer who leads Grab’s Seattle office, providing additional leadership.The ride-hailing firm has over 2,000 staff today, and its engineering presence has grown significantly over the past two years. It operates six engineering sites worldwide, beyond its $100 million Singapore center that reach includes sites in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Seattle. A Grab spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company plans to hire 800 people more for its tech team over the next two years.In a statement, Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan wished Kumaravel all the best for the future, paying credit to progress made during his time:I have the highest respect for Arul and he has been a great partner in his two years with Grab. He’s played a key role as we grew from one to six R&D centres in the last couple of years, and he’s led the launch of multiple services and new features. Arul has been a mentor to many of the Grab engineers, who have further developed their professional skills under him. They are Grab’s future leaders and I thank Arul for his contributions in building the Grab team. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours. In the last few years, the team has put in place a strong foundation as we keep developing the #1 consumer O2O platform in Southeast Asia. The recent round of funding puts us in an excellent position to invest further in our people and to scale our technology. There is unique opportunity to work with a top global team from the major tech centres in the world, and develop new services and solutions that will impact hundreds of millions of people in this region.Southeast Asia is frequently lauded as a market with immense potential for technology — a 2016 report co-authored by Google tipped the region’s internet economy to grow 6.5-times to reach $200 billion by 2025 — but with a comparatively small tech talent pool, recruitment is challenging for firms like Grab.That explains why Grab has expanded its tentacles across the world in search of engineers while its service remains focused on Southeast Asia, where it is active in seven countries and claims over 55 million downloads and 1.2 million drivers.Its main rivals are not dependent on Southeast Asia for talent either. Uber does not have an engineering team in Southeast Asia while Indonesia-based rival Go-Jek has a strong tech presence in India, where it has also made talent acquisition to grow its team.Despite the relatively quick departures of Kumaravel and Wei Zhu, Grab will press on with its policy of hiring talent from outside of Southeast Asia and moving key personnel to its Singapore base.“Southeast Asia is still a young region in terms of its technology ecosystem. It is more challenging to find tech talent as many haven’t worked on platforms that have scaled at the size and speed that Grab has. We are looking overseas for the people who have worked on large tech platforms and have developed specific expertise in areas such as machine learning and cloud technologies, and will also continue to invest in the raw talent of Southeast Asia,” a spokesperson said.",Ubers Asian rival Grab loses its head of engineering  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"The math is pretty hard to argue with. Rogers bought the Blue Jays for a mere $165 million in 2000. Today the franchise is worth more than $1.6 billion. By any measure, that’s a nifty return on investment. Rogers has made a bundle. Why not sell it now?Speculation hit a fever pitch this week when Roger’s chief financial officer said this: “We’re looking at ways to better surface values for the Blue Jays,” Anthony Staffieri told a conference in New York. “[The Blue Jays have] become a very valuable asset for us that we don’t get full credit for.”The quote sent both the business and sports worlds into a tizzy. Who would buy the Jays? What would they sell for? What would it mean for the team’s prospects in 2018?But it’s worth taking a deep breath and looking at the whole story (or quote) for what it is. First of all, the full quote adds a pretty important caveat.“To be clear,” he said in the same breath. “There isn’t anything imminent that we’re about to announce, but we’re certainly looking at the alternatives.”Fans cheer the team, not the owners. (Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images)This wasn’t an announcement. Staffieri had been asked directly by a UBS analyst if it still made sense to own a sports team.Staffieri — who has mused about selling off non-core assets in the past — initially responded that it does make sense. But he added there are other ways of getting sports content (for example, he mentioned Rogers’s 12-year, $5.2 billion deal for the rights to NHL hockey).Rogers issued a statement once speculation about a potential sale began to spread.“We have terrific sports assets, including the Toronto Blue Jays, that have performed really well for us. As we have said, we would like to surface value and get credit for these assets in our overall company valuation.”So, what, precisely does it mean to “surface value”? One obvious way to surface value of an asset is to sell it. But the Rogers statement certainly implies Staffieri was merely trying to say the full value of the franchise isn’t fully reflected in the Rogers share price. The company made it clear there are no plans, processes or timelines in place to sell the team.Fans stream into the Rogers Centre. The team brought in revenue of $278 million US in 2017, according to Forbes. (Shutterstock / ValeStock)Beyond the semantics, there are probably just as many arguments to sell as there are to keep the Blue Jays on the books.Forbes says the team has annual revenues of $278 million US ($358 million Cdn). It values the franchise at $1.3 billion US ($1.68 billion Cdn). The team may have finished second last in their division, but it has the third best attendance of any team in Major League Baseball.But these last years have been something of a historic anomaly. The Jays stunk up the American League for years, attendance was way down, and TV ratings were lagging too.Today, even after a lousy season, the franchise is on a high, and its value has soared.The Jays make up about three per cent of Rogers revenue, but the team gives the company an outsized halo, at least as long as the team is winning. Everyone loves the Jays when they’re playing baseball in October. But does the corporate owner of a team get much credit for the good years?The Ted Rogers statue that stands outside of the Rogers Centre was unveiled in 2013. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)“Everybody hates the owners,” says Howard Bloom of Business Sports News. “If the team wins, everyone loves the players. If the team loses, everyone blames the owners.”Bloom says if that irrational sporting maxim makes even a handful of customers choose a competitor over Rogers, it’s an issue. Especially so when the Jays make up such a small fraction of the overall revenues.On the other hand, he says Rogers needs content. Live sports is one of the very last bastions of traditional television. A large part of the value of the Jays is tied up in the fact that Rogers owns the whole enchilada: the stadium, the team and the broadcast rights. Individually, Bloom says the team isn’t worth nearly as much.“The Blue Jays [alone] can’t make money,” he told CBC News. “But it makes sense if you own the broadcast rights and everything else. Just to sell off one without the other? Good luck to Rogers.”Rogers mulls selling Blue Jays4:47Besides, Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management, says live sports isn’t just a buffer against changing consumer habits. He says sports programming is no longer just about watching a live game. “We’re looking at sports as a brand where there’s all sorts of ancillary forms of content that are emerging — you know, pre-game shows and fantasy sports,” he told CBC News this week. And that gives broadcasters a firmer grip on TV and media not just today but in that unknown future of digital and over-the-top television consumption.Jose Bautista and his famous bat flip rallied fans to the Blue Jays, if not necessarily to Rogers. (Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images)Baseball is a funny game though. The famous Billy Beane is quoted saying, “It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball.” Even the business side is touched by the romantic, ethereal, almost irrational sentiment tied up in the game.Rogers’s struggle is to tap into that sentiment, convert it into customers and count the money.Like any asset, Rogers will most likely sell the franchise — once the gains to be had from selling the team outweigh what it’s worth to the company’s bottom line. Sure, there’s more romance in a manager tinkering with the lineup or going to the bullpen in a late October game. But the owners deciding when to make their own moves is just as big and just as important a part of the game.Follow Peter on Twitter @armstrongcbc",Is Rogers really going to sell the Blue Jays?

"MANILA (UPDATE) - President Rodrigo Duterte has signed an executive order banning smoking in public places nationwide, officials confirmed Thursday.Speaking to ABS-CBN News, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said Duterte signed the executive order last May 16. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella also confirmed that Duterte already signed the EO.Ubial said the signing of Executive Order 26 was made in time for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day on May 31.Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking banDuterte had made his campaign vow to impose a nationwide smoking ban similar to what has long been implemented in Davao City, where he served as mayor for over two decades.Duterte had shunned criticism to his policy, especially those coming from the tobacco industry.EO No. 26 titled “Providing for the establishment of smoke-free environments in public and enclosed spaces,” listed as a prohibited act smoking in “enclosed public spaces and public conveyances, whether stationary or in motion, except in DSA (designated smoking areas).”The EO provides standards for a spot to be considered a designated smoking area (DSA), which may either be an open space or a separate area with proper ventilation.For a DSA inside an enclose space, there shall be no opening that would allow air to escape into smoke-free area of a building or conveyance, except for a single door equipped with an automatic door closer.A DSA shall also have a non-smoking buffer zone. The combined area for a DSA and its buffer zone should not be larger than 20 percent of the total floor area of the building or conveyance.The DSA is also barred from being located within 10 meters from entrances, exits, or any place where people pass or congregate, or in front of air intake ducts. There shall be no more than one DSA in a building, and the chosen area should bear proper signage.Minors are prohibited from DSAs, the order said.The EO, however, bars the establishment of DSAs in schools, hospitals, clinics, food preparation areas, and locations in which fire hazards are present.OTHER PROHIBITED ACTSThe EO also prohibits “persons-in-charge” to allow, abet or tolerate smoking in public places.Persons-in-charge refers to a president or manager in case of a company, corporation, partnership or association, or the administrator in case of government or private property, facility, office or building, and the city/municipal schools superintendent, school president, dean or principal in case of schools.Selling, distributing, or purchasing tobacco products to and from minors are also prohibited. Ordering, instructing, or compelling a minor to use, light up, buy, sell, distribute, deliver, advertise or promote tobacco products are likewise prohibited.The EO also bars placing tobacco advertisements and other promotional materials within 100 meters from the perimeter of a school, public playground, and other facilities frequented by minors.Persons-in-charge are also mandated to establish internal procedure and measures through which the EO shall be implemented and enforced within the area of which he is in charge.Those who will be found to have violated the EO shall be punished in accordance with applicable penalties under Republic Act 9211 or the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.Local government units are also enjoined to develop, promote and implement their respective Local Smoking Cessation Programs.",Duterte signs executive order on nationwide smoking ban

"Former President and current Pampanga Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo praised the current president, Rodrigo Duterte, for his bold reforms and his ability to “inspire and unite” the people in his first year of presidency. Arroyo said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown awesome leadership and resolve in the many programs that he promised to do during his presidency.”“In his first year, he managed to institute various bold reforms against illegal drugs and corruption. His Build, Build, Build initiative is commendable and is a step in the right direction towards achieving inclusive growth.”Arroyo’s government was marred by numerous controversies in regard to electoral cheating and alleged cases of corruption. However, that did not stop her from once again being voted into a position of power. For the former president, President Duterte managed to inspire and unite the Filipino people. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo stated:“More than his accomplishments in his work as President, President Duterte has achieved to inspire and unite the Filipino people towards his goal of effecting real change for the country. I wish him success and the best of health for the rest of his term as he fulfills his mandate for the nation and for the people.”Shortly after winning the presidential election, Duterte began to develop a close relationship with former president Arroyo. He also appointed many of her former subordinates to office and occasionally seeks her counsel. He also often invites her to official gatherings.Meanwhile, Former Senator Bongbong Marcos, Jr., a known ally of the president, also lauded Duterte for being a “good leader” and establishing an “important position” of the country in the international community. He said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown one singular quality that is very clear and the reason why he is very popular–the quality of leadership. For example, he has redirected our foreign policy and that is the reason why we have regained once again a crucial and important position in the international community to the benefit of the Philippines. It is the same with various domestic policies.”The former senator also said that Filipinos recognize the president’s efforts.

"MANILA, Philippines — Joreen Bautista, the Kim alternate in the United Kingdom tour of Miss Saigon, returned home recently, but only for five days, to celebrate her 18th birthday with her family and closest friends. Little did she know she was in for a big surprise when she was treated to a grand coming out party to really make her debut an unforgettable one.Joreen’s actual birthday was on Dec. 1. But she left the country a week earlier, still with fond memories of how she marked her 18th birthday. What she originally knew was a simple dinner, turned out to be a grand party with more than a hundred guests.Her family — dad Joey, mom Maureen and younger brother Jimuel — connived with five of Joreen’s closest girl friends and classmates from Brightwoods School Educational Venture Academy in Angeles, Pampanga, where Joreen is presently in 12th Grade under the school’s home study program.The minute Joreen and her mom arrived into the venue in the family car, the birthday girl was blindfolded by her classmates and was ushered into a large function room of the Black Angus Steak and Rib House in Angeles, Pampanga, home of Joreen’s family. The guests were instructed to shout, “Welcome to Dreamland,” as the blasting music of The Heat Is On in Saigon, set the tone for the party.In an off-shouldered mocha cocktail dress created by her uncle Stephen Victoriano (brother of her mom), Joreen addressed her guests when her blindfold was removed. “I’m back to where my dream started,” she tearfully said. “I’m going back to my roots. I didn’t know the party was this big. I was told it was just a simple dinner. It was bigger than I expected.”Joreen Bautista with her surprise guest, Gerald Santos, who plays Thuy in the United Kingdom tour of Miss Saigon. Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Then Joreen entertained her guests with memorable Disney classics — Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid and Reflection from Mulan. Throughout the night, she also gave her guests a sample of what she has been doing in the UK for the last six months. To a live piano accompaniment, she belted out Kim’s heart-wrenching number, I Swear I’d Give My Life for You, for her son, Tam.In I Still Believe, Joreen did a duet with her mom Maureen, while she rendered Sun and Moon with her dad Joey (short for Joselito). It wasn’t hard to conclude that Joreen’s singing talent was inherited from both her parents. Meanwhile, her name was a combination of the first names of her parents, while her second name, Moriah, was taken from the Bible.Her 14-year-old brother, Jimuel Martin, bragged that he “composed a song” for Joreen. Yet, he merely sang “Happy birthday,” as his surprise to his sister. Nanny Josephine, who took care of Joreen from the time she was only three months old, was also present. The nanny still works in the Bautista household up to this day.Joreen’s Grade 12 classmates at Brightwoods School entertained the guests at the reception. Her dad said he was thinking of a free band that can perform in the party. Then, the girls popped up and they gamely serenaded the guests. The girls also participated in the traditional 18 Candles, while the boys close to Joreen danced with her in the 18 Roses.Joreen’s mom, Maureen, taught for 17 years at Brightwoods. However, the mom resigned two years ago and opened her Beauty Overflows Salon in Angeles, Pampanga.Joreen’s special guest that night was her Miss Saigon co-star, Gerald Santos, who plays Thuy in the musical. In the party, they rendered I See the Light from Rapunzel.

"Egypt announced Saturday the discovery of two small ancient tombs in the southern city of Luxor dating back some 3,500 years and hoped it will help the country’s efforts to revive its ailing tourism sector.The tombs, located on the west bank of the river Nile in a cemetery for nobility and top officials, are the latest discovery in the city famed for its temples and tombs spanning different dynasties of ancient Egyptian history.Egyptian excavation workers restore pottery near a tomb in Draa Abul Naga necropolis in Luxor. (Hamada Elrasam/The Associated Press)“It’s truly an exceptional day,” Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said. “The 18th dynasty private tombs were already known. But it’s the first time to enter inside the two tombs.”Al-Anani said the discoveries are part of the ministry’s efforts to promote Egypt’s vital tourism industry, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, which was hit hard by extremist attacks and political turmoil following the 2011 uprising.Tourists photograph an entrance of the newly discovered tomb, which officials hope will help revive the country’s ailing tourism industry. (Hamada Elrasam/The Associated Press)The ministry said one tomb has a courtyard lined with mud-brick and stone walls and contains a six-metre burial shaft leading to four side chambers.

"Columnist Ramon Tulfo claimed in his December 5 article for the Philippine Daily Inquirer that the only son of Philippine National Police Director General Chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa enjoyed special treatment at the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA).He questioned how Bato became proud of his son despite of some rumors that his son Rock Dela Rosa received VIP treatment inside the academy.Tulfo revealed that several upperclassmen of the son of the PNP Chief complained that Rock is always watched by his guards and doesn’t sleep in the barracks, an activity that strictly prohibited inside the PNPA.“How can Bato be proud of his son who has bodyguards and did not undergo hardship like his fellow plebes?” Tulfo wrote.“Rock’s upperclassmen, as well as his fellow plebes, are complaining that he is always under guard, doesn’t sleep in the barracks and goes out most nights,” he added.Dela Rosa is not yet responding on the column of Ramon Tulfo against his son.Last week, PNP Chief Bato he congratulated his son Rock for surviving the rigorous training as a fourth class cadet of the Philippine National Police Academy.Photos of the meeting between Bato and Rock catches the hearts of the netizens after the soon-to-be-retiring leader of the PNP didn’t stop his emotion and hugged his son tightly.“Ako, anak ako ng tricycle driver kaya no retreat, no surrender ako. Papasok [ako] doon – kahit na babagsakan mo ako ng shot put sa tiyan ko, hindi ako uuwi ng Davao. Pero siya, anak siya ng chief PNP kaya iba na rin ‘yung psychological kuwan niya. Medyo kuwan lang ako, apprehensive, but anyway, pabayaan ko siya kung ano gusto niya sa buhay,” he saidThis is not the only time that Ramon Tulfo criticized Dela Rosa in his column.In January, Tulfo called Dela Rosa a ‘clown’ for ‘making the public laugh instead of being serious in his work’In response, Dela Rosa said that “I’d rather be a clown that makes people laugh instead of that person (Tulfo) because he’s always frowning.

"MANILA, Philippines — When Mireio opened nearly a year ago at Raffles Makati, with its Provençal theme and Marcel Antonio mural and dishes from the south of France, it brought an exotic touch to downtown. This was an “upscale brasserie” that celebrated simple, earthy dishes and foods developed by Provençal chef Nicolas Cegretin (now preparing to transfer to a Fairmont hotel in Canada).During the course of the year, Mireio expanded its menu to include classics like steak frites and more French-Mediterranean flavors from neighbors like Spain, Italy and North Africa.Now, to celebrate its first anniversary, Mireio is going back to its roots, offering nine of its signature dishes at the very reasonable price of P365 each during a festival from Dec. 8 to 12 called, appropriately, “A Year in Provence.”From 12 noon to 10:30 p.m. during those five days, guests can enjoy appetizers like the signature smoked salmon tartare with Granny Smith apple and Dijon mustard cream; classic tomato tart with clams and escargot, garnished with rocket salad and parmesan cheese; and soup of green lentil with pan-seared foie gras and truffle oil.For the main course, choose from signature Mireio dishes like the very Provençal slow-cooked oxtail parmentier, traditional herb-crusted jackfish on ratatouille, and orzo with king prawns flambéed in Pastis and star anise cream.For dessert, select from classic French pastries apple tart tatin topped with vanilla ice cream, lavender crème brûlée or 65 percent Maracaibo chocolate mousse with truffle and hazelnut crunch.Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:Raffles marketing and communications manager Monique Toda explains the concept: “We’re playing on the idea of the book A Year in Provence with the pricing (each generously portioned dish for the price of P365), of course, plus the anniversary. These nine dishes were the signature dishes we opened with and are our bestsellers.”While Mireio began with a very specific concept — everything Provençal, from the chef to the ingredients to the art lining the walls leading upstairs to open-air bar The Terrace — it’s broadening its scope to allow more possibilities. Now, according to Raffles and Fairmont Makati food and beverage director Stephane Tremblay, “Everything goes — we can use spices and flavors from Italy, Spain, North Africa.”Of course, according to Mireio restaurant manager Nicolas Bracq, “This doesn’t mean we will be serving a paella or a couscous, but we will bring ingredients from here and there, to give the menu more touches from around the Mediterranean Sea.” Think clams with Ras el hanout, a mix of spices from North Africa; tagliatelle pasta; various risottos, or calamari frites done with “touch of Provence”: special mayonnaise, bell pepper and thyme.Says Tremblay, the core of Mireio will remain the dishes introduced by chef Cegretin, which are still popular sellers. “The DNA of Mireio is always the first, it’s the structure; we need to keep the DNA Provençal.”As the holidays roll around, Mireio also wants guests to celebrate. Following the popular “Champagne and Martinis in the City” happy hour — where guests enjoyed unlimited Champagne at the upstairs Terrace for P900 — Mireio is now holding “La Vie en Rosé,” another happy hour featuring — you guessed it — rosés from the South of France in tantalizing combinations such as Aperol Spritz with Prosecco; or Frosé, a refreshing slushy cocktail with rosé, vodka, lemon and pureed berry juice.Says Bracq, “Guests are curious in general, so when they come here we try to teach them something outside their dining experience. It can be about the simple name ‘Mireio,’ which is linked to the Frederic Mistral poem; it can be linked to the Ayala Champagne we serve — people ask, ‘Is this owned by the Ayala family?’ No, not at all; this is owned by the Boulanger house in France.” Guests like details like this, and tell their friends.While chef Cegretin transfers to Canada and Mireio expands its menu, Raffles and Fairmont Makati is expanding too: it’s hiring possibly Manila’s first female executive chef, Anne-Cécile Degenne, formerly at Sofitel Singapore and Saigon, who’s also appeared on Top Chef France Season 5. She will likely make the final choice on Mireio’s new permanent chef, who, according to Tremblay, doesn’t have to be from Provence, but he (or she) does have to be French: “We don’t mean to be picky — we would just be narrowing our selection — but it is open to French nationals.”French to the core.

"Following the recent open letter published by Maine Mendoza, a lot of netizens have been construing other celebrities’ status messages, tweets, and posts as always pertaining to Maine Mendoza. For one, Vice Ganda’s recent tweet of general encouragement for everyone who is going through something has been interpreted by Maine’s fans as addressed to her. Netizens were quick to tag the Dubsmash Queen in their replies, despite the fact that it remains unconfirmed whether the said tweet really was meant for her.This is why veteran comedienne Ruby Rodriguez was shocked when she tweeted a thank you message to Globe which says, “Loyalty is not a sign of weakness but of true character. It shall not go unrewarded. Thank you Globe, Christmas is here. #GlobeIPhoneX”.The tweet, which was posted on December 2, garnered a lot of negative reactions and comments from netizens. Ruby also received a lot of online bashing. This was due to the fact that the tweet exceeded the limit of 160 characters, and was thus cut as follows: “Loyalty is not a sign of weakness but of true character. It shall not go unrewarded. Thank you… instagram.com/p/BcLS7DOH3s1/”.Netizens then automatically assumed that the tweet was about Maine Mendoza, whose stay in “Eat Bulaga” and GMA has recently been the center of many controversies. She has not been seen in the show since she published her open letter. Rumors of her transfer to GMA’s rival network ABS-CBN have been rampant, which was probably why her ‘loyalty’ is now being questioned by some.However, Ruby Rodriguez was quick to clarify that her tweet was not about Maine. On December 3, Ruby tweeted: “Omg!! Ok lang kayo? Globe Loyalty program ang post but kailangan lagyan ng meaning!!???!!!”. She also took to Instagram to address the issue, saying “Dont put any other meaning sa post po. Thats a loyalty program ng Globe.”Globe Telecom is really known to shower preferred clients with rewards for their loyalty, just as any other telecom network would. However, it seems like netizens have become overly-sensitive with anything that can be linked to the open letter posted by the Dubsmash Queen.What do you think of the netizens’ negative reactions towards Ruby Rodriguez’s tweet which was apparently not about Maine Mendoza?

"A new planet hunter has been fired up in Northern Chile — the ESPRESSO machine doesn’t make coffee but is a massive spectrograph that is the most powerful planet-hunting tool ever to scan the cosmos.What does ESPRESSO stand for?It stands for the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations. It is a light detector that determines what wavelengths or colours are coming from the distant reaches of the galaxy. It’s a device that is connected to European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile that doesn’t have a lens exactly like a traditional telescope but instead detects electromagnetic frequencies, which includes light waves.What is ESPRESSO looking for?It is scanning the skies for habitable planets. We have heard a lot in the news about various planet hunting missions, Kepler for instance, and the James Webb Space Telescope to be launched in spring 2019.But this ESPRESSO spectrograph is bound to an Earth-based telescope. It’s a little harder to see beyond the atmosphere of Earth, but it’s also a lot easier to fix when things go wrong.An artist’s impression of the James Webb Space Telescope to be launched in spring 2019. (Northrop Grumman/NASA)So far, dozens of rocky Earth-like planets have been found. The first step in finding planets like Earth is to just find other planets orbiting around other stars — there are literally an infinite amount of them. Then, those planets have to be narrowed down to those that are rocky, those that are also the right distance away from the star they orbit to not be too hot nor too cold, something called the Goldilocks zone.This Goldilocks zone is essential because it’s when it is just right that liquid water could form on a rocky planet. And voilà … a second Earth. If only it were that easy.How do you hunt for planets far off in space?There are a few different strategies to do this. ESPRESSO uses something called radial velocity. We can tell approximately how fast a star is moving in space by detecting the light coming off of it, and we can look for differences in that light if a planet orbits.Francesco Pepe from the University of Geneva is the lead author on this project. He explains radial velocity this way: “You imagine that you have a star which is low in the universe, so it’s travelling by its own. So it will travel with a constant speed. If there is a planet around this star, then by gravitational pull, the heavier the planet and the closer to the star, the easier it is that it will produce a larger gravitational pull, so the signal will be bigger.”In other words, an orbiting planet around a star will make the star wobble every now and then as it orbits, because it is being dragged around by the mass of the planet. That’s what they are looking for. The problem is the planets that could be habitable are small rocky ones that aren’t massive so the signals ESPRESSO is trying to detect are unimaginably small.Has anything been found?No, the instrument has taken what is called first light, which is a maiden voyage of sorts to see if everything works. There is an extended calibration phase to make sure any signals that are detected are real. But the ESPRESSO team are already looking at our stellar neighbourhood.To start the search, the Very Large Telescope will be looking at the regions of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, about 10 light-years away. (Peter Komka/EPA)To start the search, the telescope will be looking at the regions of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, about 10 light-years away. But results won’t be truly available until the middle of next year as the researchers make sure that the spectroscopic detector is working with the precision needed.What does the detector look like?It’s a beast. In order to detect such tiny shifts in the flight of the stars it must be big and full of expensive and incredible engineering and be incredibly precise.“It’s a huge vacuum tank of about five metre length, two metres in diameter with huge optical components, lenses and so on on it,” Pepe said.Everything closed into this vacuum vessel in order to work without air pressure variations because otherwise these would disturb our measurements, and everything is then kept to one mili-degree of temperature stability and this spectograph and this 10-tonne beast is enclosed in the cellar of the Paranal Observatory, just below the telescopes.”This photograph shows ESO’s Very Large Telescope during observations. (Serge Brunier/ESO)Pepe was in charge of overseeing the dismantling, crating and reassembly of the ESPRESSO detector on site in the mountains of Chile and crossed his fingers the whole time that everything would work. The initial calibration results are going extremely well. Soon, it will be online and analyzing all the stars that we can see on a dark night to determine, perhaps, if an Earth-like planet is out there within our view.",This ESPRESSO machine doesnt make coffee but scans the skies for habitable planets  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"The invasive emerald ash borer beetle has devastated urban tree canopies and strained municipal budgets wherever it has touched down. Winnipeg has been bracing for its unwelcome arrival and the day of reckoning is finally here.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirms as much — a suspect ash tree on Dan Law’s St. Boniface boulevard was sampled and showed signs of borer beetle larvae inside.Emerald ash borers were first detected in Detroit and Windsor, Ont., in 2002, but they had been in North America under the radar since the early 1990s. They spread through surrounding areas, eventually turning up in London, Ont. (2006), Toronto (2007) Montreal (2011) and Quebec City (2017).The city’s first confirmed emerald ash borer infested tree was found by Dan Law, who called the city when he noticed the tree on his boulevard looked different than last year. (CBC)They arrived in Winnipeg more quickly than federal researchers expected, and it’s possible borers have been right under Winnipeggers’ noses for two to four years, said Dan McKenney.“It will take a few years before the effects are noticed, but then it really ramps up really quickly,” said McKenney, senior scientist with Natural Resources Canada’s forest service in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.“It’s kind of flabbergasting how it seems to be slow … and then it just hits with a vengeance.”“Here in Ste. Marie it’s pretty much come and gone in eight years,” said John H. Pedlar, McKenney’s colleague and a forest biologist at the Great Lakes Forestry Centre, on Friday.Whereas Winnipeg’s prolonged and costly battle with Dutch elm disease is likely to continue for years to come, McKenney said Winnipeg can kiss its ash trees goodbye, likely within the next decade.Natural Resources Canada states on its website that typically, 99 per cent of ash trees in infected areas die within six years.Just how significant is this little pest?City of Winnipeg forester Martha Barwinsky says Winnipeg is at risk of losing all of its green ash trees — 350,000, give or take — in the next decade. The species makes up 30 per cent of all of city park and boulevard trees, which are valued at nearly $440 million.The “value” likely includes various factors like cost of replacement, shade and heat benefits, rainwater run-off prevention, aesthetics and property values, said Krista Ryall, a scientist with Natural Resources Canada’s forest service who has been studying borers for a decade.“It’s a major financial implication to the municipalities trying to cope with this … it’s devastating,” said Ryall,She said the cost of managing the beetle has ranged from $3 billion to $10 billion US over the course of invasions across several American cities.“One year things can look fine and by the end of that same season you can have all these dead and dying trees.”The 2,000 dots on the map below are a random sample of Winnipeg’s green ash trees, the second-most common tree in the city. The data reveals although the tree was widely planted across the city, there are high concentrations in newer neighbourhoods, which experts say are likely to become the problem areas with the appearance of the emerald ash borer in Winnipeg.McKenney and Pedlar published a paper in 2012 that estimated when the insect would reach Winnipeg and suggested it could cost about $200 million just to remove infected trees from streetsides — an estimate they still believe is conservative.“Our spread modelling suggested it would be between 10 and 20 years before it arrived in Winnipeg,” Pedlar said.McKenney said it could be that spreads in the United States helped the beetle reach Winnipeg quicker than expected.Winnipeg was put on notice last year when the bug burst onto the Thunder Bay scene, less than 700 kilometres east of Winnipeg.Signs of an emerald ash borer infestation include D-shaped exit holes in the bark of the tree. (CBC)One thing working against the city is that Winnipeg has a much higher percentage of ash trees than most places out east, McKenney said.On the other hand, the Prairie city has the benefit of knowing how Ontario cities reacted — or didn’t — in those early years.“We knew nothing at the time, so they had no tools and no options, really, to work with,” said Ryall.As Canada’s patient zero, Windsor learned this lesson first. It would be tempting to imagine the beetles would move out of town after reducing the majority of ash trees to sawdust, but in Windsor, even the tiny ash saplings were eaten and the pest remained planted in the Ontario border city, Ryall said.Winnipeg strategyRyall is leading a project with the City of Winnipeg on how to stem the spread and plans to visit in early 2018 to get a sense of how widespread the invasion is.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which monitors emerald ash borer populations in Canada and regulates efforts to prevent the spread of the pest, will conduct the first phase of visual surveys in St. Boniface and the surrounding area in the next two months or so, Ryall said.An ash tree can harbour borers for several years and present no obvious signs of infection, so crews will use a pruning system Ryall devised that allows foresters to peel bark back and see the “galleries” of tunnels carved out in the wood beneath the surface.Serpentine tunnels under the bark where the larvae have travelled are signs of emerald ash borer infestation. (CBC)“There’s lots of trees that may be infested and not showing any symptoms,” Ryall said, adding the bark-peeling campaign will likely start early in 2018. “This will occupy them for quite a few years to come.”Those initial results will inform the city’s strategy, she said, which may eventually include the mass release of a parasitic Chinese wasp species. The wasps evolved alongside borers and hunt down their larvae (don’t worry, they don’t bite people), and Ryall already led such an experiment in Quebec and Ontario last year.One species of the parasitic wasps released, the Oobius agrili, will lay eggs inside the eggs of the emerald ash borer. (Houping Liu/Michigan State University)A facility in Brighton, Mich., breeds and sells the wasps, and Ryall is now raising her own winged legion in Sault Ste. Marie.Though the wasps hold promise, they work best in heavily forested, rather than urban areas that don’t experience the same frigid winters as does Winnipeg. It’s unclear whether they’ll thrive in a colder climate, Ryall said.Winnipeg is home to several species of woodpeckers, and researchers have noted the long-billed birds have developed a taste for the borers in parts of the U.S.Scientists have also found a way to coax beetles out into the open using pheromones produced by female borers, but that isn’t yet being done on a large scale.TreeAzin ‘vaccine’There’s also now a vaccine-like injectable called TreeAzin that is commercially available in some parts of Canada that can be shot into specific “high-value” ash trees.All of these tactics are constrained by city budgets and time.“Unfortunately it is fairly expensive,” said Pedlar.He says the cost of inoculating an average-sized ash tree is roughly $165. Each tree has to be injected about every two years, said McKenney, and that process has to go on indefinitely. That adds up for homeowners interested in saving trees on their private property, and the price for a treatment could rise with demand.“That’s why it’s a dilemma,” McKenney said. “It’s a serious situation.”The trick to stemming the spread will be to identify and destroy big infected trees.City forestry workers are already facing a backlog of Dutch elm disease-infected trees identified a couple years ago which are still in the ground, contributing to the spread of that disease.Ryall said minor landscaping duties have fallen by the wayside in other municipalities consumed with fighting borers.Managing expectationsUltimately this issue is as much about managing expectations as it is about managing pests.Ecologists and pest-management specialists, often with a tone of reluctance, deliver the same aphorism on invasive species in cases such as these: once invaders get into a system, good luck getting them out.That system in this case is a city whose leafy tree coverage is dominated by a pair of monocultures in American elm and green ash.A moratorium was enacted on planting elms as a way of curbing the spread of Dutch elm once it was first detected. And the city has tried to turn a corner in recent years by planting a more diverse group of tree species to make the whole urban forest less vulnerable to disease outbreak and infection, according to Barwinsky.Winnipeg has taken that old chestnut to heart, she says — to some degree we’ve learned from our past monoculture mistakes and are taking steps so we’re less doomed to repeat them.“I think it is a wake-up call to try to have more diversity in terms of what your tree canopy is,” Ryall said.You can find more information on the beetle through the city’s website.

"Ozamiz Police led by Chief Inspector Jovie Espenido successfully seized some 14 kilos of shabu worth P112 million from three different operations in Misamis Occidental on Wednesday.According to Espenido, the shabu that they discovered were the old supply from the Parojinogs who ended their decade reign in Ozamiz City after a bloody pre-dawn drug raid that left 15 people dead including their former Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr.He said that because the Parojinogs were already no power in Ozamiz City, they are now having difficulties to earn money and sell their illegal drugs.“Lumang supply iyan, pagdating ko sa Ozamiz tinago nila. Ngayon lang inilabas dahil nakita nila, na naghahanap sila ng pera at patay na yung papa nila,” Espenido in an interview with Dobol B sa News TV.“According sa nakuha naming information up to 86 kilos iyan last year. ‘Yung transaksyon nila, ‘yung taga-Cebu, magpupunta sa Ozamiz, sakay lang ng barko. Ganundin ‘yung taga-Lanao, taga-General Santos,” he said.In their first operation, 32 million pesos worth of shabu were seized from a certain Butch Merino, a former bodyguard of detained Ozamiz Vice Mayor Princess Nova Parojinog.Espenido said that they received an information that Nova Parojinog is still continuing her illegal drug business inside the PNP Custodial Center.He was caught by the authorities in a checkpoint and they discovered one kilo of shabu worth 8 million pesos, a firearm and magazines.Merino also told the police about the identity of his supplier identified as Melden Rabarez, who later arrested in an entrapment operation together with a certain Roselyn Walohan. They seized P27-M worth of illegal drugs from Rabarez.According to Espenido, the shabu were planned to deliver to a distributor in Lanao Del Sur.In the second operation, they seized 64 million worth of shabu, however their target escaped the men of Espenido while the 3rd operation confiscated 2 kilos of shabu from the son of former Board Member Parojinog who also killed during the bloody drug raid several months ago.The Ozamiz police also seized eight kilos of shabu from Melodin Malingin and Gaudencio Malingin, known supporters of the Parojinogs.They also seized two kilos of shabu and guns from the house of Maychell Parojinog Gumapac, while heavy firearms were discovered from the house of Manuelito Francisco.Meanwhile, the cops also recovered grenades and guns from the house of former Ozamiz City Councilor Ricardo Parojinog who’s still at large.The raid happened several days after Duterte administration declared that the war against illegal drugs would be brought back with the cooperation of PDEA.Espenido shocked the nation after he successfully raided the houses of the powerful Parojinog family in Ozamiz which resulted to 15 deaths in July.The anti-drug raid also resulted to the arrest of former Vice Mayor Princess Parojinog and others.",Espenido is back!

"Roque’s “Nine out of ten”Assuming the unlikely event that Roque’s “nine out of ten” statistic has factual basis, asking the public not to panic solely on the basis that 90% of the vaccine recipients are protected directly negates Roque’s supposed reputation as a human rights lawyer.Does the protecting 90% justify endangering the remaining 10%? The government “inoculated” over 700,000 individuals, so the fact that Sanofi and the government endangered over 70,000 is “no reason to panic”? Besides, how sure is Roque that 90% have had dengue before, which is a requirement for the vaccine to work as designed?Where is the study? When was it published? Where was it published? Or did the government just made that number up to justify the botched mass vaccination program?To add further insult to injury, Roque, aside from being the presidential spokesman, is also the Presidential Adviser on Human Rights.What’s more disturbing, however, is the Department of Health’s claim that Dengvaxia provides “a 30-month protection” before the risk of contracting severe dengue kicks in.Referring to those who received Dengvaxia but have never had the virus in the past, Duque said in Filipino , “Even if they received their first dose, they shouldn’t panic because the first dose of the vaccine gives protection for 30 months.”Under Duque’s “30-month protection” theory, all of the recipients under the assailed vaccination program must still be alive by today, because the program was launched only 20 months ago.Civil society group Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) claims that at least three kids have died after receiving Dengvaxia as manufacturer Sanofi maintains that there have been no deaths due to the vaccine“30-month protection” a myth?DoH Sec. Duque versus Reality“…The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true… infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)…”Please, not another Christine!I smelled fearShocked in TarlacDr. “Santos” takes no one elseShocked, confused, and slightly scaredA ""new"" Leijani “resurfaces”DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:In as early as program’s second week, however, a male recipient was pronounced dead on arrival at the Bataan General Hospital after suffering from cardiac arrest.Just two weeks after the death, authorities exculpated Dengvaxia by pinning the blame on congenital heart disease. Then-Health Secretary Janette Garin, who was the vaccine’s main government proponent and who headed its regulatory approval, ascertained the cause of death in no more than 14 days.Authorities said the child died “ due to cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema and other underlying causes such as congenital heart disease, gastroenteritis, with moderate dehydration. Now, Dengue can trigger cardiac arrest [ Vancini-Campanharo 2016 ]. It’s is linked to pulmonary edema [ Lee 2012 ]. It also has symptoms similar to gastroenteritis [ Varatharaj 2010 ], and it also causes dehydration [ US CDC ].Is former Health Sec. Garin absolutely certain that it’s not dengue, or was she, along with the rest of her department, merely trying to cover up the mess?I have reason to believe that it is so, as Garin has an extensive history of ignoring multiple World Health Organization warnings against Dengvaxia, warnings that were issue way before, right before, and immediately after the launch of her catastrophic mass immunization program.If Garin indeed attempted a coverup, does it also mean that Health Sec. Duque’s “30-month protection” theory is just a figment of his imagination?Just hours ago, News5 reported that 10-year-old Bataan 4th grader Christine Mae de Guzman, one of the vaccine’s first recipients, died from severe dengue before receiving her second dose of Dengvaxia scheduled October this year. Christine had no prior history of the disease: this was her first dengue infection.Duque’s “30-month protection” theory would have meant that Christine would still be alive by now.But according to the death certificate, Christine died from severe dengue.What happened to this Christine seems to confirm the untested risk with Dengvaxia that Sanofi itself cited in a 17 March 2016 document of the World Health Organization. Sanofi said that for those who have never had dengue:Was Duque referring to some parallel universe that the rest of the planet has yet to discover? If so, then let us hope that we can refund the P3.5 billion we paid Sanofi so we can ship the 700,000 kids to the Bermuda Triangle and hope against all hopes that they will somehow end up there.But then, I am very big believer of Hanlon’s razor, or the saying, “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”So, should we attribute the “30-month protection” theory to malice, or is it merely a product of stupidity?Yesterday, I interviewed Lejani Pangalangan, a Tarlac mother who claimed that her daughter, Aimy Junnel Tamayo, contracted dengue Aimy never had dengue prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. She received all three doses under the same mass immunization program where the late Christine got hers. Aimy’s last Dengvaxia shot was in August 2017, and the mother claims Aimy contracted dengue three months later on 28 November 2017.After the phone interview last night, the mother and I agreed to meet this afternoon. I told her that I will visit them in Tarlac so I can interview them personally. The mother was even glad that I’ll come to visit because I promised to help them with the bills after she told me that she even had to borrow money so she could bring Aimy to the hospital.The mother also said in the interview that the child was vaccinated without parental consent, although she doesn’t blame Aimy’s teachers for it because she believes that the teachers acted only upon orders from the Department of Health.I wrote a  article about that phone interview and it was published last night at 12:12 AM . The article quickly went viral and it has garnered over 16,000 shares as of this article’s writing.A few hours later at 7:12 AM, the mother Lejani tried to call me but the signal on my phone was poor. I have a morning radio program, “Karambola sa DWIZ”, so I was inside a building at time, preparing for the show. I texted Lejani, asking why she tried to call.Lejani replied in Filipino, “I just want to correct something I said. I think I was mistaken when I said there was no parental consent. I signed a waiver before the first dose. The teacher found a copy.”That was odd. Leijani said she discovered about the immunization only after Aimy’s younger sister complained about why she wasn’t given Denvaxia too. If Leijani indeed signed a consent form, how would she totally forget about it?JUST A FEW HOURS LATER AND SHE’S BACKTRACKING ALREADY!?I felt that Leijani was lying about the consent form, but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Despite my reservations, I immediately updated the article to reflect this development and I informed her about it about it right away.A few minutes later, Lejani texted, “Please, sir, I do not want to ruin their reputation! Please delete the article if you don’t mind! They love my daughter a lot!”I replied, “Yup. They’re safe. I’ll protect them.”Should there be problems, I was intent on defending Aimy’s teachers, even if it has to be in front of Education Secretary Leonor Briones: I would’ve done so even if no one asked for it. I have interviewed Sec. Briones just two weeks ago , I have her contact details, and I believe that she is a very fair and just human being who responds well to reason. Teachers are already overworked and underpaid. While they are expected to follow all the rules by the book,I am a firm believer that they deserve to be shown more compassion than most people. Despite the assurance, the mother repeatedly insisted that I take down the article, but it takes more than a couple of text messages for me to do that. Leijani sent one text after another, with each subsequent message sounding more and more panicky.Unfortunately, my radio show starts at 8 AM so I couldn’t read or respond to her messages during that time, so I texted, “I’ll speak to you later po, I’m on air right now.”(The Filipino word “Po” is a form that indicates respect or politeness .)After the radio show ended, I immediately and repeatedly tried to call her after the radio show but her phone cannot be reached. I started to worry, as there are wide range of things that could have gone wrong with the child. Leijani told me the night before Aimy’s platelet count was low at 38 and may still be falling.From my best recollection, I think I managed to call her at around 11:30 AM as I was on the way to Tarlac, I confirmed with her that we will meet between 2 and 3 PM as previously agreed upon.I texted her again at 12:50 PM, asking her if she was alright.She replied at 1:53 PM with, “I hope you can delete the article.”I arrived at the hospital at exactly 2:19 PM, in line with our agreement.Right before I entered the lobby, a hospital staffer recognized me and asked for a photo. The hospital staffer said he is one of my social media followers so he was already aware of what Leijani and I agreed upon. He told me that Aimy and Leijani have already been transferred to another hospital.I was shocked. I told him I needed more details, so he introduced me to another hospital staffer who witnessed the hospital discharge. Note that I will never reveal their identity, for their own protection.The second staffer told me the following that doctors from the Department of Health – Tarlac arrived at hospital around 9:00 AM. The doctors spoke to Leijani over breakfast at the hospital cafeteria.He said the doctors paid for all the expenses Leijani has so far incurred and told the hospital that they will facilitate the patient’s discharge for transfer to Jose B. Lingad Hospital in the neighboring province of San Fernando, Pampanga.Do provincial DoH offices have discretionary funds that can be used to “bail out” patients from private hospitals?If so, why just Aimy? Some of Aimy’s neighbors also got struck with dengue and are in the same hospital, so why did DoH Tarlac take Amy and no one else?The hospital staffers said all the hospital employees who witnessed the scene were all surprised.Concerned about mother and child, a hospital employee even asked Leijani if she will have a place to stay in Pampanga. According to the staffer, one of the DoH doctors said they’ll give Leijani a room.One of the staffers told me that it was highly irregular and perplexing.He said there’s a dengue epidemic in Leijani’s village and some of the other dengue victims are admitted in the same hospital. He wondered why DoH-Tarlac took Leijani and Aimy and left everyone else behind.He said they left at 12 noon in a vehicle with DoH-JBL decals (branding).One of them told me in Filipino, “You know, one of their teachers also contracted dengue. Her platelet count is less than 10 so she’s on the 5th floor. Would you like me to bring you to her?”I respectfully declined the offer on humanitarian grounds. The teacher’s platelet count is low so I do not want to subject her to further stress anymore. For all I know, she might start hemorrhaging just by trying to talk.Asked for the names of the DoH doctors, the staffers said they can’t recall the exact names anymore, but one of them said one of the doctors had a surname of “Santos”.Something felt really off so I decided that it’s better if I do not stay in that place for too long. If there’s a massive coverup going on, then it’s not improbable that somebody within the hospital premises may be looking for meI thanked the hospital staffers, quickly exited the building, did a quick 5-minute Facebook live session as proof that I really went there, then immediately left Tarlac.Tarlac, after all, is the home of former President Benigno Aquino, one of the masterminds of the Dengvaxia Scandal.I tried to call Leijani again as soon as we got onto the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, but no one was answering. For some really weird reason, Leijani, the Dengvaxia victim’s mother, doesn’t want to talk to me anymore.I immediately called my friend Sass Rogando Sasot at around 3:35 PM and I told her about what happened. She asked for Leijani’s number and she said she’ll call Leijani herself.The rest of the this section is based on how Sass recounted the events to me.Sass dialed Leijani’s number but it was busy.She dialed it again and it rang. Leijani picked it up.Sass asked Leijani, “I want to donate, where I can I send my donation?”Leijani and her friends were trying to solicit financial help for Amy online since last night. Thus, Leijani shouldn’t be surprised if she gets calls from total strangers, in the same way that she wasn’t surprised when I called her last night.Leijani said, “You can deposit it to a bank account.”Sass asked, “Where are you right now?”“In Pampanga,” Leijani replied.Sass asked,” How did you get there?”Sass heard somebody talk to Leijani and just moments later, Leijani hung up.Available data suggests that DoH Tarlac took just Leijani and her daughter Aimy. They left Tarlac for Pampanga at 12 noon and the call took place at around 3:35 PM so Leijani’s relatives, if any, are unlikely to be there that fast.Who was coaching Leijani, a Health Department employee?Leijani suddenly “came back to life” when she texted me again at 7:33 PM and apologized for not informing me about their transfer. She said she was already groggy out of hunger and exhaustion. She said somebody told her about the Facebook live session I did in the hospital in Tarlac.She admitted that DoH Tarlac offered help and she accepted and that there was no money involved. She said she wasn’t silenced in exchange for money, and all that she wants is a quiet life and what’s best for her daughter.The whole nine yards.I can’t take her word for it anymore because I have reason to believe that her texts were sent under duress. No, she’s in probably in no physical danger, but as a mother, I think she feels the necessity to comply with whoever is necessary, for the sake of her daughter.#DengGate has been raging for almost a week now, but we have yet to hear from a President who’s typically vocal even about the littlest of issues.If Duterte knew about #DengGate, would he be in Greenbelt yesterday to shop as the parents of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lose sleep over the Dengvaxia scandal? That’s not Duterte, so somebody may be keeping the issue away from his eyes… and his daily briefings.I think there’s a coverup going on, from a little bit below the top all the way to a little bit above the bottom. After all, many of them may be complicit to this whole mess, and many of those heads will roll if somebody opens the can of worms.Remember DoH Tarlac.The relative silence of government authorities, the mismatching official statements, the disappointingly scant media coverage of what would otherwise be a major national issue… all of these point to a concerted effort to play down #DengGate.All these, in my opinion, point to a massive coverup.And who are the suspects?Read the title, for starters.

"BINONDO, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – Apparently not content with its claim over the disputed territory in the South China Sea, the Chinese government today announced it was laying claim over the oldest Chinatown in the world — in Manila!Manila’s Chinatown, located in and around the Binondo district, was established in the late 1500s. It was built by the Spaniards as a settlement for Catholic Chinese, and was positioned across the Pasig River so that the colonial rulers could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects. To this day, it continues to be a center of commerce and trade in Manila where all types of businesses are run by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry.Almost a quarter of the Philippines’ 100 Million population are of Chinese descent, and China is demanding loyalty from them.The administration of Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino immediately protested the Chinese announcement, saying “China cannot just kidnap 25 percent of our population. What are they planning to do? Build a wall around Binondo and make our Chinatown their overseas seat of government?”Aquino called U.S. President Barack Obama at 3 a.m. Monday morning (U.S. East Coast time) to report the latest move by the Chinese government.The U.S. and the Philippines have a mutual defense agreement which provides for the use of Philippine bases by American military forces.

"It may be chilly out, but if you bundle up and step outside over the next week, you’ll be able to enjoy one of the most active meteor showers of the year: the Geminids.Though you can spot a meteor on any given night, Earth has a major meteor shower almost every month, when it passes through a trail of debris left over from a passing comet or asteroid.Each December, we pass through debris from asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which orbits the sun once every 524 days.The shower runs from Dec. 4-23, but peaks on the night of Dec. 13-14. Though you can head out any time to catch a few, your best bet is likely from Dec. 12 to the night of Dec. 15.During the peak, you can see upwards of 120 meteors an hour as they travel through the atmosphere at 35 km/s. But to do so, you should get to a dark site.You can use this animation to see how Earth passes through the remains shed by the asteroid.3200 Phaethon may be something astronomers refer to as a “dead comet,” in part because of its highly elliptical orbit around the sun. But astronomers still aren’t sure how to classify this intriguing rock as, when it nears the sun, it doesn’t produce a tail like comets do.Interestingly, on Dec. 16 the asteroid — discovered in 1983 — zips past Earth roughly 10 million kilometres away.Observing tipsThe best thing about this year’s Geminids is the moon, or lack thereof, which will be only roughly 14 per cent illuminated on the night of Dec. 13, meaning there won’t be any significant bright light to drown out the fainter meteors.So where to look? You just need to look up. But, there is a direction from which the meteors seem to be coming, called the radiant. This shower’s radiant lies in the constellation Gemini, hence the name.Gemini rises in the east around 10 p.m., but the later it is, the better your chance at seeing some meteors, as the constellation gets higher in the sky where it’s darker. And try to stay away from anything bright — including your phone.So, if you have clear skies and plan to brave the elements, head to a dark location and look up. If you’re in a light-polluted city like Toronto or Vancouver, you’ll likely still manage to catch some of the brightest meteors, as this shower tends to produce bright ones with great colour. Just try to stay away from streetlights and you’re sure to catch a few.","How to watch the Geminids, one of the most active meteor showers of the year  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"Manila Times writer Rigoberto Tiglao broke down how the Rufino-Prieto family owes almost Php 3 billion to the Filipinos in taxes from their Mile Long prime property in Makati and Dunkin’ Donuts enterprise.“If government’s claims are valid, and its figures accurate, the Rufino/Prietos’ liabilities through their firm Sunvar Realty and Development Corp. would be this P1.8 billion, plus the P1.5 billion alleged tax evasion by another firm they own, Dunkin’ Donuts,” Tiglao explainedWith the amount of almost Php 3 billion, Rufino-Prieto are just like any other Chinese-Filipino tycoons “notorious for being tax evaders”.President Arroyo’s Solicitor General Agnes Devanadera in 2009 revealed that the elite family owed Php 1.8 billion for Sunvar. This was based on the Php 630 million the family owes from illegal and unauthorized use of the property from 2003 to March 21, 2009 and the Php 10.4 million monthly rent from April 2008 until it was given over to the government.Rufino-Prieto dismissed their debts after maneuvering through several court cases and continued to charge rentals from over 400 stores for 14 years after its lease expired in 2002.The Sunvar debt is a “measly rent of P360 per square meter per month government is asking Sunvar to pay—a give-away price in a prime area where rents are at least P50,000 per sq. m. per month.”Supreme Court (SC) issued a decision on 2012 that urged the elite family to pay ASAP the debts that they owe to the State.In the SC’s court ruling, it said:“The Court notes that respondent Sunvar has continued to occupy the subject property since the expiration of its sublease on 31 December 2002. The factual issue of whether respondent has paid rentals to petitioners from the expiration of the sublease to the present was never raised or sufficiently argued before this Court. Nevertheless, it has not escaped the Court’s attention that almost a decade has passed without any resolution of this controversy regarding respondent’s possession of the subject property.”Despite the intervention of the SC, the lower court took three years to issue a decision. Metropolitan Trial Court Judge Barbara Aleli Briones in July 2015 ordered Sunvar to pay only P555 million, a mere 30% of what they owe.It was until the case reached Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 141 Maryann Corpus-Manalac and MRTC Branch 59 Judge Winlove Dumayas that the Rufino-Prieto family had their way and was granted control of the property.Tiglao pointed out that when the Mile Long property was being guarded over by former President Macapagal-Arroyo, their news arm, Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) “demonized” Arroyo and continuously publicized alleged corruption scandals.However, when former President Benigno Aquino III took seat and suspended the case on the questionable lease of their properties, PDI “unabashedly idolized and supported” his administration.President Rodrigo Duterte swore to look into these property deals of the Rufino-Prieto firm as he also lambasts their news arm for criticizing and demonizing his administration when the elite family owes up to billion to the Flipinos.Tiglao challenges the status quo and questioned, “what would the hundreds of thousands of urban poor squatters in the metropolis say when riot police try to eject them? ‘Why us poor, not the rich squatting on prime government land?’”",Public Trending

New evacuations were ordered as the fire sent up an enormous plume near Montecito and Carpinteria, seaside areas in Santa Barbara County.“The winds are kind of squirrely right now,” said county fire spokesperson Mike Eliason. “Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it’s blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we’re in.”Southern California’s gusty Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region’s most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.‘This is the new normal’Gusts of up to 64 km/h are expected through Monday, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.Containment increased Sunday on other major blazes in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. Resources from those fires were diverted to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the 699 square kilometre fire that started Dec. 4 in neighbouring Ventura County.As of late Sunday, the Thomas Fire had destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191.Firefighters use drip torches to set a backfire at night in an effort to make progress against the Thomas Fire before the winds return with the daylight near Lake Casitas on Saturday near Ojai, Calif. (David McNew/Getty Images)Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a years-‘long drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.“This is the new normal,” Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura fire. The governor and experts said climate change is making wildfires a year-round threat.Ellen DeGeneres’ house at riskHigh fire risk is expected to last into January.The air thick with acrid smoke, even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave, fearing another shutdown of U.S. 101, a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week. Officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that’s home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.“Our house is under threat of being burned,” Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at midday Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets. I’m praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters.”Ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities.1 confirmed deathIn San Diego, which is 209 kilometres to the south, the Lilac Fire was 75 per cent contained. The flames erupted suddenly Thursday in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Downs training centre, where it killed more than 40 elite thoroughbred race horses, and destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in a retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape the fire that continued to smoulder Sunday.Despite the size and number of wildfires burning in the region, there has only been one confirmed death: a 70-year-old woman, who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city where the Thomas Fire began.Most of last week’s fires were in places that burned in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighbourhood of Bel-Air that burned six homes and another in the city’s rugged foothills above the community of Sylmar and in Santa Paula",Firefighters brace for second week of California wildfires  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"Alleged Vice Mayor Nova Parojinog's scandal video is now talk of the town on social media after several bloggers posted about it online. It was said that the Ozamiz vice mayor was caught on video in a compromising position and that she had engaging in such acts to bribe police officials.Searches for the phrases 'vice mayor nova parojinog scandal' has suddenly erupted after social media users try to find the said video. Nobody ever found such video, though, and that is because it's most likely no more than a hoax being spread online by black hat bloggers for their personal gains.An interview with Police Chief Inspector Jovie Espinido wherein he stated that some politicians in Ozamiz tried to bribe him with sexual favors in the past only gave credence to the existence of a scandalous video of Parojinog whom the netizens quickly figured the inspector was talking about.Malicious bloggers and internet marketers saw the opportunity for their personal gains, hence the birth of a made up scandal that actually doesn't exist, at least at the moment.Even our resident scandal expert, who have found and watched countless materials of such nature for the sake of journalism, of course (duh), also said that he had scoured all known platforms in the internet where such footage might have been uploaded but to no avail. He also said that it was just a sheer waste of time to search for it. He kinda looks frustrated, actually. It was written on his face that he firmly believes such video of the Ozamiz vice mayor does not exist.Most people who tried searching for the said video only found themselves watching the replay of PTV news report below which most certainly does not contain what its thumbnail shows:Wait there's more.We here at Pinoy News Blogger always remind our readers that spreading malicious content on the internet such as the so called, if ever it exists, is against the law.",Alleged Vice Mayor Nova Parojinog Scandal Video Spreads Online But It Might Be Just A Hoax
"3759 SHARES Share TweetKamias or also known as blimbi are one of the most underestimated fruits in the world. It is similar to the star fruit, but the kamias fruit has a specific sour flavour, which makes an incredible addition to a large number of exotic cuisines around the world.The fruit is native to the Philippines and it the people there are highly aware of its beneficial properties.The fruit itself is packed with vitamins C and B as well as minerals such as iron, phosphorus and antioxidants. Kamias isn’t as popular as other tropical fruits, but its popularity has been rapidly growing thanks to its recently-discovered high nutritional value.It’s funny that while we Filipinos are so familiar with Kamias, we rarely look into their healing properties. Because of its complex nutritional compounds the mighty plant, from the stem to the flower to the fruit, can be used for these purposes:1. Treating CoughYou can easily relieve cough by mixing a few grains of fennel, 3 pieces of kamias, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil then steam for several hours. Divide the water in two. Drink the first half in the morning on an empty stomach, and the other half in the evening.2. Overcome DiabetesKamias is extremely beneficial for people suffering from diabetes. Prepare 6 pieces of Kamias and crush. Mix with water and boil the mixture. When ready, strain and drink twice a day.3. Overcome AcneKamias’ acid properties can help in treating acne. Just crush into fine powder and apply topically as needed.4. Overcome Thrush or SingawJust like in the previous number, crush the Kamias and apply topically. Be warned, this will sting.5. RheumatismAlleviating rheumatic pain can easily be done by crushing a few kamias leaves and one peice of kamias and mixing the two together until you end up with a smooth mixture. Mix this with water and apply it on the affected areas. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times a day.As usual with natural remedies, it is best to treat the problem with proper exercise, diet and a consultation with your doctor.",Did you know that eating kamias everyday can do this to your body?
"It may still be the punchline of many a joke, but self-pleasure has come a long way since American Pie's apple pie incident.While the stigma around self-love is slowly shrinking, we have to ask: Is it possible it's affecting our ability to get it on IRL?Masturbation actually helps keep your sexual pilot light on, says Megan Fleming, Ph.D., a sex and relationship therapist.If you get in the habit of bringing yourself to orgasm and experiencing that onslaught of dopamine, oxytocin, and stress relief, you won't start with a cold engine when you want to get revved up with a partner.Getting excited to get it on may not be a problem for some, but if you tend to have a low libido, solo sessions can help you know exactly what turns you on, Fleming says.And while no one's going to touch you exactly like you do, having a super-great time with yourself won't necessarily diminish a bout with someone else, says Megan Stubbs, a sexologist and sex educator.Instead look at masturabation like an opportunity to communicate with your partner—touch yourself in front of them, walk them through what you're doing, and they'll pick up tips.m the typical, scripted sex couples can fall into.It's all good (really good): Masturbation gives the libido a helping hand, keeping us revved up and in tune with our bodies.Outside of certain conditions and hormone imbalances, there's no way to ""tap out"" of desire—so feel free to keep going at it with the person who knows best.",HOW MASTURBATION AFFECTS YOUR SEX DRIVE
"You’ve been missing multi-awarded broadcaster and motorcycle rider Jay Taruc, haven’t you? Jay’s show Motorcycle Diaries folded up after six years but he’s making a comeback (with a vengeance) still astride on his now-iconic motorcycle in Ride Ph with Jay Taruc which premieres on Sunday night, Aug. 20, still on GMA News TV.The half-hour tele-magazine show focuses on everything about motorcycles. The Rider’s Profile and My Ride segments feature riders and their exceptional love affair with their bikes. Biker groups share their club’s experiences in Bike Tribes. In the Motor Issues segment, the latest motorcycle products, models and services in the market will be showcased while relevant issues concerning motorcycle riding are discussed.“Ride Ph promotes ‘moto-tourism,’ with Bike Stops and Bike Routes which feature hangouts and routes around the country,” said Jay whose docu-traveler side comes out in Jay Riding as he discovers compelling stories during his rides. “One of the features to look forward to in the first season is the historical Himalayan Team ‘Pinas adventure ride.”Advocating safety riding, Ride Ph aims to be a platform for educating the riding public about road safety. A staunch safety-riding advocate for two decades now, Jay shares his passion with the growing community of two-wheeled riders in the country. In the past few years, there has been a rapid shift in the Filipinos’ transport practice and the motorcycle has increasingly become the preferred ride due to road congestion. In fact, motorbike sales spiked up to 40 percent the previous year.“We cannot stop the increase in the number of motorcycle riders,” said Jay who owns six bikes. “But they should be reminded na hindi lang puro saya ng ride, they should be responsible not only to themselves but to other people on the streets.”On Season 1, Ride Ph will dart from one end of the country to the other to participate in the largest motorcycle gatherings, discuss urgent motor issues and practical tips to everyday riding glitches, and of course, the coolest bike tribes and hottest bikes.Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1The show is sponsored by Dickies, BMW, Shell Philippines, Spyder, Uratex, Loctite, Big Bike Tech, PTT Oil, Ducati Group and many others.A Masscom (Broadcasting major) graduate from Centro Escolar University (CEU), Jay is one of the four children of well-respected veteran radio icon Joe Taruc. Jay’s two brothers are into business while their youngest sister takes care of their parents.Born on Jan. 26, 1973 (Aquarius), Jay stands 5’10”; and wears L/XL-size shirt and size-10.5/11 shoes.Why did you choose the motorcycle as your means of transport in your quest for stories?“Everywhere we go, there will always be motorcycles. And motorcycles will take you to the farthest places where you will find the most interesting stories and meet the most interesting people.”Why did you choose Dickies as your official dresser?“Dickies is an American brand known for its reliable work-wear line. It is also affordable so, a practical choice for me, especially when, like me, you are exposed to the elements when riding a motorbike. Matibay siya, bagay pang-motor.”To what do you attribute the popularity of your show?“Motorcycle Diaries ran for six years and I attribute its longevity to the thousands of motorcycle riders and enthusiasts who follow and watch our episodes. With Ride Ph with Jay Taruc, we rely on our core audience and the growing population of motor-bikers out there.”Were you influenced by your dad, The Great Joe Taruc, into following in his footsteps?“My Dad was a great influence. At first, he did not want me to become a broadcaster. Alam niya mahirap at dadaan ako sabutas ng karayom. But when I showed interest early on, when I tagged along to his radio-anchoring duties in the ’80s, he then saw my potential in the broadcasting field.”Tips and reminders from your dad?“My dad gives premium on ‘integrity’ and ‘loyalty.’ And he would always remind us, ‘A clean name and reputation’ is very important, especially in this business.”Any risks involved in the pursuit of your job?“When I was just starting out, as a young producer, the challenge was to seek out the most interesting stories that had yet to be told. Kailangan hangga’t maaari, ‘yung hindi panapapalabas o yung istoryang hindi pa nagagawa. The search for these types of stories took us to the most remote places in the North all the way to the South, around the islands, where traveling from one place to another can be considered risky in itself. Job-related risks when we were young were so appealing to us, until magkaanak na, magkapamilya, it will slow you down naturally.”Name three of your most memorable and controversial topics.“My first memorable topic would be my first I-Witness episode which was a documentary about the use of landmines in Mindanao. We documented the process of how landmines were scoured through the vast farmlands in Maguindanao, detected and diffused by an elite military bomb disposal team.“Second memorable story would be an episode where I ate batchoy or pagpag, shadowing a family for hours who would collect scraps or pagpag then re-cook them for a new and warm meal.“Third memorable story would probably be that Motorcycle Diaries episode where I was able to ride with our current president, Rodrigo Duterte. It was a very memorable ride within his balwarte in Davao City.”Hosting a show like yours is physically demanding. How do you keep in shape?“I used to go to gyms. But now, I prefer to ride bicycles. Have to keep the heart pumping really well. Managing time is most difficult. I have two kids, Luis, 14 and Sofie, 8. They are both home-schooled by Mommy June. I make it a point to spend quality time with them when I’m not traveling or working.”How’s your diet; what’s usually for breakfast, lunch and dinner?“I like sweets! Which is so bad for me because my parents have diabetes. I am a light breakfast eater. I usually have a bowl of oatmeal with milk or just coffee and a banana. Pero hataw nasa lunch and dinner. I try to cut down on rice pero depende sa ulam. I drink a lot of water every day. Maybe more than eight glasses a day.”What workout do you do?“If I can’t ride my bicycles outdoor, it is stationary biking for me. Cycling would probably be my most favorite physical activity.”What part(s) of your body need improvement?“My tummy and muscles all over my body.”How much sleep do you get per night?“An average of six hours of sleep every night is probably not enough.”Aside from your celfone, one thing that you cannot do without?“I must have a charger always. A motorcycle is another must for me.”How do you unwind, cope with stress; how do you spend time away from work?“Plan a nice short ride outside the metro. There are a number of choices where to ride to. It relaxes me to just ride and breathe in all that fresh air. Rejuvenating.”Last thing that you do before you go to sleep?“I pray.”First thing that you do as soon as you wake up?“I plant a kiss on the cheeks of my son and daughter, saying thanks that I get to live one more day with them.”(E-mail reactions at entphilstar@yahoo.com.

However, an interview with a mother from Tarlac suggests that such a ""protective period"" may not be entirely true.Yesterday, Facebook user Von Dy posted two photos of a young girl in what appears to be a hospital’s Intensive Care Unit, and part of the accompanying caption reads:I am generally doubtful of claims made by random people on Facebook, so I called one of the phone numbers listed in that post, and I got to speak with a certain Lejani Pangalangan, who claims to be Tamayo’s mother.Pangalangan said the doctor fears her child may be suffering from dengue, just three months after receiving her third shot of Dengvaxia in August 2017.Pangalangan said the child started to become feverish on November 28th but she was still able to attend a school competition the 29th, although she has already become weak and frail by then.After the family got home, Aimy’s cousin told Pangalangan that dengue is detectable only after three days, so she brought her daughter to the hospital on December 2nd to get her blood tested.She said, “Mababa na po yung platelet. Sabi ng doktor, ipa-admit na kasi nakaka-alarma dun sa barangay niyo ay marami nang na-dengue [Her platelet count was already low. The doctor said she should be admitted to the hospital because of the high prevalence of dengue in her barangay].”Pangalangan said Aimy’s platelet count is falling. It was 61 two days ago, 38 today, and the results of the latest test are still pending.She said, ”Doon sa lugar namin, kung hindi po ako nagkakamali, 30 na po yung na-dengue. Then, dalawang estudyante po na kaklase po niya ngayon ay nilalagnat, so naalarma po sila (mga guro) [If I’m not mistaken, there have been 30 dengue cases in my village and two and her classmates currently have fever, so the teachers are alarmed at the situation].”There’s a dengue outbreak in their village right now.Pangalangan said her daughter received 3 shots of the dengue vaccine as part of the mass immunization program of Department of Health, and that her daughter has no history of contracting the dengue virus.Aked if her daughter received Dengvaxia, she said, “Grade 6 po siya ngayon. Na-inject po siya ng ganon noong Grade 4 siya… two years ago [She’s in 6th grade right now. She got her first injection when she was in 4th Grade… two years ago].”The said program was launched in early 2016, which is only about a year and a half ago.Asked on the specific date of Aimy’s first dose, she said Aimy’s teacher texted her the specific dates of vaccination. After checking her inbox, she said Aimy received shots on 30 March 2016, 13 October 2016, and 14 August 2017.Pangalangan noted that in reality, the first dengue vaccine shot may have been administered a few days later: on April 4th, 5th, or 6th.Aimy was injected with Dengvaxia, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi’s newly-launched anti-dengue vaccine.She said she wasn’t notified about the vaccination program. She said she wasn’t made to sign anything, and nothing was explained to her by any school official.“Actually po, noong sinasaksakan sila, hindi po namin alam (We actually didn’t know they got vaccinated until they did),” Pangalangan said.Pangalangan added, “Nagulat na lang po ako noong umuwi po iyong isang anak ko, sabi niya, ‘Ma, si Ate, nagpa-inject pero kami, hindi.’ (I was shocked when one of my kids came home and said, ‘Mom, my elder sister was vaccinated but we weren’t).”Pangalangan asked her younger child what was injected, and the child said it was an anti-dengue vaccine. “Natuwa pa po ako, anti-dengue pala, e di maganda siya… Sino ba naman po ang hindi matutuwa e anti-dengue po pala? (I was actually pleasantly surprised because it was anti-dengue, so it’s good for her… Who wouldn’t be glad that she got anti-dengue vaccine?),” Pangalangan said.She had no idea how the vaccine works because nothing was explained to her. That is, until her elder daughter Aimy was hospitalized a few days ago.Dengvaxia is effective on recipients who have had dengue. However, if injected on persons with no prior history of dengue, the vaccine may worsen the disease at the first natural infection, i.e. through a mosquito bite. Thus, preliminary testing for presence of dengue antibodies in a prospective recipient is key, as doing so would determine if Dengvaxia would be appropriate to administer.Aimy was never tested prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. Moreover, Pangalangan said there was no preliminary screening done to Aimy or any of her classmates.She said all of Aimy’s 4th grade batchmates were vaccinated.“Hindi ko naman po sinisisi ang mga teacher kasi iniisip nila kapakanan ng bata… unang-una po, utos ng DoH (I don’t blame the teachers because they only want what’s best for the kids… in the first place, it was an order from the Deparment of Health),“ Pangalangan added.With Ms. Pangalangan's permission, I published a recording of our entire phone call b elow:This entire article was largely based on the initial Facebook post and this phone call interview. Hence, I still need to visit the facility myself to more thoroughly verify the situation.And that’s what I will do.

"For almost all immigration benefits, you should save and preserve documents to establish eligibility for that particular benefit. Many people state that, for one reason or another, they no longer have documents relating to their immigration history. They moved several times and lost track of the documents; they got angry because their case was denied and tore up the paperwork, burned it and threw the ashes into the Pasig River; or lost documents or they were destroyed due to natural calamities (e.g. flood, lahar), or termites ate the paperwork, etc.Had they kept track of the documents or put them in a safe place, their chances of success would have been greater. But now the case could be more difficult and expensive.Among the documents you should keep are:1. Documents showing how you entered the US. This would include the passport and visa you entered the US on (even if under an assumed name), I – 94, other documents proving you were “inspected” at your port of entry.2. Documents showing your marriage(s) were bona fide and in good faith. If a person has ever been petitioned by a US citizen spouse, the bona fides of that marriage may come up and be questioned at any later interview. This is because the law states that if a person has ever been in a fixed marriage, all future petitions will not be approved. Even if you get divorced from your spouse, you should continue to save the pictures, love letters, and other joint documents, just in case that issue arises in the future.3. Documents showing you worked for the employer. If you obtained a green card through an employer’s sponsorship (PERM/labor certification) you will need to prove you worked for the employer after being granted your green card. In some cases, a person quits before their adjustment is granted, or they never bothered working for the sponsoring employer.

Some people apply for various immigration benefits, whether they were eligible for them or not. Some may not have even realized what they were filing for. But those previous filings will come up with any future application for immigration benefits. Therefore, if your case was denied, don’t just rip up the denial and throw it in the fire. Save it. If you can no longer locate your documents, there are ways to obtain your file from the US government.5. Documents showing your continuous residence in the US. Although there is no “amnesty” at the present time, we are still hoping and praying for comprehensive immigration reform. Almost all of these programs require that a person continuously resided in the US for a certain number of years. Therefore, in case any kind of immigration reform is passed and requires your demonstrating continuous residence, save documents proving that, such as tax returns, Dr. bills, rental agreements, phone bills, etc. Save them now, so that when comprehensive immigration reform is passed, you already have them available and organized, versus scrambling around trying to locate documents, which you may have lost or thrown out.These are just a few examples of the type of documents you should be keeping in connection with your immigration case. Don’t just throw out things or lose track of them, as it may be critical to obtaining certain immigration benefits.In addition to keeping the paper copies of these documents, you may also want to scan and email them to yourself, so you can have access to the documents “in the cloud,” even if the paper copies are lost. And to be sure of the type of documents needed for a particular immigration benefit, you should seek the advice of an attorney who can assist you.Michael J.

"Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, two southern Republican senators with little to lose politically as they enter their last months in office, strongly criticized Donald Trump’s temperament as president on Tuesday, a remarkable display as the party seeks to unite over tax reform.Corker strongly criticized Trump in interviews and on Twitter, saying the president is consistently untruthful and has debased the United States and damaged its standing around the world.“The president has great difficulty with the truth on many issues,” Corker said in a CNN interview at the Capitol, hours before Trump met with him and other senators to seek consensus on a tax reform plan.“It’s amazing. Unfortunately, world leaders are very aware that much of what he says is untrue,” Corker continued. “Certainly people here are, because these things are provably untrue. They’re just factually incorrect and people know the difference.”Although he is a foreign policy specialist, Corker is also a key player in the tax debate. His support could be crucial as Republicans seek passage of the White House-backed tax plan in the closely divided Senate.Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan played down Corker’s criticism of Trump, urging reporters to “put this Twitter dispute aside.”But Corker, a senator from Tennessee who recently announced he was not seeking re-election, pulled no punches in his onslaught against Trump, acknowledging that tensions between the two men, once allies, have been building for months.He assailed Trump for telling falsehoods that are easily disproven and questioned why he persisted in doing so.“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country in that way, but he does. He is purposely breaking down relationships we have around the world that had been useful to our nation.… I think the debasement of our nation is what he’ll be remembered most for.”When reporters caught up to Corker after the working lunch, which lasted about 90 minutes, he said Trump didn’t call him out during the lunch, and they had no interaction.Flake says he won’t runBut minutes later, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake stood up in the Senate chamber to launch a broadside at Trump as he announced he, too, won’t seek re-election in the 2018 midterms.Flake took aim at the “coarseness of our leadership” and a need to get back to civil discourse in Washington. He bemoaned how international alliances can be upended “by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters,” a shot at Trump’s frequent, unpredictable tweets.White House on Trump feud with senators2:13“Reckless, undignified behaviour has become excused and countenanced as ‘telling like it is,’ when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified,” said Flake. “And when such behaviour emanates from the top of our government, it is something else — it is dangerous to our democracy.”Flake evoked a quote from Republican president Teddy Roosevelt which begins: “The president is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct.”Flake also called on his colleagues to put country before party when necessary.“Were the shoe on the other foot, would we Republicans meekly accept such behaviour on display from dominant Democrats?” he asked. “Of course we wouldn’t, and we would be wrong if we did.”Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called Flake “a fine man” and said he was sorry to see him go.John McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently criticize Trump, was effusive in his praise for Flake.Flake’s decision to not run again was not unexpected, as he criticized the direction his party was heading in and expanded on his speech’s themes in a book released earlier this year, Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.‘When he gets hit, he’s going to hit back’Trump has previously called Flake “weak and ineffective. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the senator lacked support among voters and that stepping down was “probably a good move.”Republican Sen. Jeff Flake says ‘I will not be complicit’1:46When asked why the president engages with critics, Sanders said the president is “a fighter” and voters “didn’t elect somebody to be weak, they elected somebody to be strong.”“When he gets hit, he’s going to hit back, and I think Sen. Corker knows that and he’s maybe trying to get a headline or two on his way out the door.”Flake’s seat, like Corker’s, will head to a Republican primary contest. There will be 33 Senate races in the midterm elections on Nov. 6, 2018, while all seats in the House will be contested.‘Same untruths’Until Flake’s plea, the latest Corker-Trump fireworks took prominence in D.C. on Tuesday.Trump appeared to catch Corker’s appearance early Tuesday on NBC’s Today Show, when the senator claimed that the meeting later in the day between Trump and the Republicans was a photo op that was “not really about substance.”Trump gestures to reporters as Russian flags thrown by a protester fall in front of the president and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell as they arrive for a Republican luncheon. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)“Bob Corker, who … couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote minutes later on Twitter.Trump also claimed that Corker had supported the nuclear deal that the U.S. and several countries struck with Iran. Corker in fact voted against the deal.Trump’s claims prompted a retort on Twitter from Corker, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”Corker used the hashtag #AlertTheDaycareStaff, harkening back to comments he made earlier in the month that the White House had become an “adult daycare centre.”Trump later in the morning issued a few more tweets directed at the Tennessee senator, including calling him “liddle Bob Corker,” a reference to the senator’s modest height.Corker, who supported Trump for president, later told reporters on Capitol Hill it was a choice he regretted.But Tuesday evening, Trump was praising some of his Republican colleagues.","Reckless, outrageous and undignified: Republican senators attack Trump  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

"China asks US, S. Korea not to Sell Fighter Jets to PhilippinesChina asks US, S. Korea not to Sell Fighter Jets to PhilippinesManila | Reports about China’s failed attempt to block the sale of F-16 fighter jets to the Philippines have re-emerged amidst ongoing tension on South China Sea.According to an American source, the Chinese government intercepted the Philippine’s plan to acquire a squadron of F-16 fighting falcons from American defense company Lockheed-Martin. A representative from the communist country allegedly called Lockheed-Martin CEO Marilyn Hewson through backdoor channel and asked her not to sell the lethal jets to the Philippine government.The CEO then responded and told the communist government that they have no right to ask such highly unacceptable request. Hewson said that only their government (the United States of America) can ask the company similar request, and besides, it is a government to government business transaction and that the company cannot derail them.The F-16 fighting falcon is a multi-role air superiority fighter jets developed by General Dynamics and later sold to Lockheed-Martin. There were around 4500 units have been manufactured and used mainly by the United States Navy and Air Force. The said aircraft is one of the most lethal and formidable fighter jets. The Philippines is set to acquire a squadron (12 units) of F-16 starting 2016 according to Air Force chief Lt. Gen. Lauro Catalino dela Cruz. “Air Force is going to acquire the latest version of F-16 fighting falcons,” the general said.In separate news, a South Korean news outlet published a report that reveals China’s attempt to block South Korea from selling FA-50 fighter jets to the Philippines.A report in The Chosunilbo Monday cited Yomuiri Shimbun’s Oct. 18 report that China made the request prior to former President Aquino’s state visit to South Korea on Oct. 17.The said request by China happened prior to Aquino’s approval of buying 12 FA-50 multi-role trainer/fighter jets.Korea reportedly declined, saying it cannot accept “interference” in arms exports, which Seoul considers an issue of national interest.The Philippine and South Korean governments have agreed to fast-track Manila’s procurement of 12 lead-in fighter jets to upgrade the defense capabilities of the Philippine Air Force (PAF).The Korean government declined to comment about the report, but some top officials of the Korean Armed Forces confirmed the report.The FA-50 and F-16 fighter jets are both superior to China’s current inventory of refurbished Russian Shenyang fighter jets according to Globalfirepower.comDespite of China’s attempts to block the Philippines plan to upgrade its Military, the country is now going forward and the plan will not change according to Aquino.Ten patrol ships for the Philippine Coast Guard are currently built by Japan and the first delivery is expected to arrive on the last quarter of 2018, a senior navy official said.","China asks US, S.

"From his jail cell in Ukraine’s capital, opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili is calling on supporters to rally for the impeachment of the president and has declared a hunger strike.Saakashvili, the former governor of the Odesa region who was stripped of his citizenship this summer, was arrested Friday night. He hasn’t been formally charged, but prosecutors say he colluded with Ukrainian businessmen tied to Russia to topple President Petro Poroshenko.Saakashvili rejects the allegations, pointing to his long record of opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Saakashvili must be brought to court for arraignment within 72 hours of arrest. No day for that has been announced. A spokesperson for the prosecutor-general’s office, Andrei Lysenko, said Saturday that officials will likely ask for him to be held under house arrest after his court appearance.He also faces the possibility of being sent back to his native Georgia, where he faces charges of abuse of office from his years as president from 2004 to 2013.Saakashvili was the key figure of the 2003 Rose Revolution protests that forced Eduard Shevardnadze to resign the presidency. Saakashvili was elected the next year to replace him. During his tenure, he earned wide admiration for anti-corruption efforts, including revamping the police force, but critics said the headstrong leader showed a growing authoritarian streak.He left Georgia in 2013, and in 2015 was named by Poroshenko to be Odesa governor. The next year, Saakashvili resigned from that post, claiming Poroshenko and other officials were impeding reforms in Odesa and he became a strong critic of his former patron.Supporters helped him cross borderGeorgia stripped his citizenship after his move to Ukraine, and Poroshenko this summer rescinded his Ukrainian citizenship, leaving Saakashvili stateless. He was out of the country when he lost Ukrainian citizenship, but forced his way into Ukraine in September, barging across the border with Poland, helped of a crowd of supporters.Saakashvili, centre, appears with some of the supporters in downtown Kiev who freed him from a police van last Tuesday. He was arrested again late Friday. (Sergei Chuzavkov/AFP/Getty Images)His lawyer, Ruslan Chernolutsky, said Saturday that Saakashvili had written a statement in jail saying “don’t be afraid of anything and boldly go to Sunday’s peaceful demonstration” for Petroshenko’s impeachment.He also said Saakashvili would refuse food while in detention.Saakashvili’s detention and his call for a protest on Sunday raise tensions in a country shaken by two massive protest uprisings in this century. Poroshenko became president in the wake of bloody 2014 protests that drove his Russia-friendly predecessor to flee the country.Saakashvili supporters have set up several dozen tents in a protest encampment near the parliament building. But police have not moved to disperse it, possibly concerned that such action would only inflame tensions.",Jailed Mikheil Saakashvili calls for Ukraine presidents impeachment  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"President Rodrigo Duterte recently signed an executive order banning smoking in public places nationwide. Executive Order 26 provides standards for designated smoking areas (DSA), which may either be an open space or a separate area with proper ventilation. Speaking to ANC on Friday, Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag explains that smoking areas should have a “buffer zone” so that non-smokers would not be exposed to the air. “There should still be a buffer zone wherein people close to the designated smoking area will not be exposed,” he said.SPONSORTayag said areas where smoking is totally banned are health facilities, establishments frequented by minors, areas with potential fire hazards such as gasoline stations, areas where food is cooked, public stairways, escalators, and elevators.Minors are also not allowed in smoking areas. Meanwhile, all buildings, regardless of size, are only allowed 1 smoking area, Tayag said.He also noted that electronic cigarettes are not covered by the EO which only covers tobacco productsShare this story!Visit and follow our website: Duterte Hot News© Duterte Hot NewsSource: #http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/05/19/17/where-is-smoking-allowed",Where is smoking allowed?

"A particular video earned extreme hate from netizens as it showed documented and detailed procedure of a lethal injection.The video was called ""#DeathPenaltyFail: A Lethal Injection,"" and it lived up to its title. Lethal injection is one of the most common methods used as the death penalty for prisoners deemed ""too evil"" for society. It is implemented with the belief that it is the easiest and the most humane way to kill the person as it will only stop the heart from beating. They usually inject three drugs into the bloodstream-- sodium thiopental to make the prisoner unconscious, pancuronium bromide to paralyze the muscle and the respiratory system , and lastly , potassium chloride to finally stop the heart from beating.However, this very method has accumulated the highest botched procedures in inmates as of 2014. In fact, 2014 has been hailed as the worst year in the whole history of Lethal Injection in America. Contrary to its claim of being easy and painless, many of the lethal injection executions went wrong in some way, and turned into rather gruesome deaths.This video is one of the worst execution recorded where it was revealed that most of the prisons that conduct lethal injections, obtain their drugs from shady sources. Furthermore, most of the people involved in doing the procedure aren't even medically trained!The curtains were eventually drawn at the end of the video after it turned too brutal. Many netizens were angered and wished to junk death penalty.",Watch This! Shocking: Video Of A Failed Lethal Injection Goes Viiral And It Will Give You Goosebumps!

"From July to September, the Philippine economy swelled by 6.9% – dumbfounding the government’s critics and virtually guaranteeing that the administration’s full-year growth target of between 6.5% and 6.7% will be comfortably achieved.That third-quarter figure isn’t an aberration; it doesn’t lie. It’s the result of a sound fiscal policy focused on a nation-building programme that seeks to attract high levels of investment by displaying business-friendly credentials and liberalising market entry for overseas firms.It’s the other side of the coin to one usually shown by those opposed to President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule. In fact, the only time they bring up the economy is when they can show it in a bad light. They’ll flag an underperformance of the stock market, a weakening of the peso – neither of which has anything much to do with the economy’s fundamentals – or issue some scare story about investors pulling out or taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding future investment plans; stories which they back up with an extraordinary lack of evidence.Certainly, the Philippines is a volatile market – but not for the reasons the critics put forward. The volatility in this market is not the result of Duterte’s War on Drugs, nor his battle to subdue Islamic-extremist groups in the south of the country; nor the ongoing seemingly interminable conflict with the communist New People’s Army. Of course these are all issues that have to be weighed, but the reality is that their influence on the broader economy is limited.The real market volatility comes from the onslaught of negative publicity aimed at undermining the president and his government. This is being driven by a political opposition lead by the Liberal Party which was vanquished in the May 2016 election that propelled Duterte to power. It would seem for them, and their coterie of human-rights groups and tame media – both domestic and international – that economic failure would be a price well worth paying if it can deliver them back into office.We’re not saying there’s no political risk in the Philippines; of course there is – there always has been as there is elsewhere in most countries of Southeast Asia. The archipelago’s Muslim and communist insurgencies are hardly new – they’re age-old problems, but wretched though they are for society they’ve never ever come close to bringing the economy to its knees.So how stable is the government – the litmus test for political risk? Well, despite its opponents’ best efforts to destabilise it, it’s very stable. For one thing, Duterte is extremely popular with his people. A poll produced last month by Pulse Asia Research Inc. put his approval rating at 80% and his trust rating at 80%.This isn’t Venezuela where mass protests denounce the illegitimacy of the government and call for their president to step down – Filipinos have got the government they want and the president they want. In fact, the best chance of a Venezuela happening in the Philippines is if Duterte is removed from power. In short, this government has an overwhelming mandate from the people.Then there’s the vote of confidence from the credit-rating agencies, all of which have the Philippines at investment grade or above investment grade – Japan Credit Rating Agency, BBB+; Moody’s, Baa2; S&P, BBB; Fitch Ratings, BBB-. Ratings agencies aren’t noted for going out on a limb – in fact, in anything they lean towards the side of caution.And yet, despite the blitz of negative publicity generated by opponents ranging from Human Rights Watch to the New York Times to the Philippine Roman Catholic Church to CNN to Liberal International to progressive-Left politicians from nearly every page of the atlas, the ratings agencies are of one mind; that the outlook for the Philippines is ”stable” and “positive”.Furthermore, they’re likely to stay that way even if Duterte did actually decide to form a revolutionary government – something which he said at the weekend would only happen “if things got out of control”; if there was a real danger of a violent coup.Thailand, a fellow member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, actually has a revolutionary government; a military junta. It’s called the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council and it’s been in control of the country, and its economy, since 22 May 2014 when its leaders took power in a coup d’état. Here are Thailand’s current credit ratings: Japan Credit Rating Agency, A+; Moody’s, Baa1; S&P, BBB+; Fitch Ratings, BBB+. They’re actually better than the Philippines’.So if Duterte did decide to go the Thai route and install a Filipino version of the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council, its credit rating would be unlikely to budge. Neither would his approval and trust ratings – Duterte’s supporters have regularly urged him to establish a revolutionary government to allow him to get on with his reform programme.Investors, therefore, need to take what they read in the papers and hear from the TV networks with a very large pinch of salt. ‘Economic analysis’ from those quarters is no such thing – it’s the avoidance of economic facts that would weaken their political argument. They cannot afford to make positive points about the management of the Philippine economy – to do that would be tantamount to endorsing Duterte. So that’s not going to happen.Is their instability in the Cabinet – another indicator of political risk? There is not. Destabilising elements have been removed. Liberal Party chairman, Vice President Leni Robredo, the virtually self-styled leader of the opposition, was asked to “desist from attending all Cabinet meetings” as of 5 December last year.Left-progressives who opposed Duterte in Cabinet on a number of issues – for example over his approval of former president Ferdinand E. Marcos’s burial in the Heroes’ Cemetery in Manila – have also departed. Social Welfare secretary, Judy Taguiwalo, Agrarian Reform secretary, Rafael Mariano both failed to win approval from the Commission on Appointments.The same fate befell Environment and Natural Resources secretary, Gina Lopez, whose draconian mining policy complete with the blanket issuance of mine-closure orders threatened to split the Cabinet at one stage.Perhaps with a couple of very minor exceptions, Duterte’s Cabinet is solidly behind him. It includes childhood friends, former classmates, San Beda College of Law fraternity brothers, PDP-Laban party mates and long-time political allies, members of his presidential transition committee – as well as former military and police chiefs who go back to his days as mayor of Davao City.In short, it’s extremely loyal. But it also has at its core some very capable individuals – among them, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, an economist and former banker who’s headed some of the country’s largest corporations, including Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier; National Economic and Development Authority secretary, Ernesto Pernia, an economics scholar and former lead economist with the Asian Development Bank; Budget secretary, Benjamin Diokno, a highly respected economist who held this same post from 1998-2001 in the Joseph Estrada administration.Add to them, Trade secretary Ramon Lopez, an economist with more than 20 years experience in the private sector as head of a large, publicly listed corporation, and Transport Secretary, former businessman and consummate administrator, Arthur Tugade – the former president and CEO of Clark Development Corporation.In short, there’s no political risk there – nor is there any lack of talent. Furthermore, among the policymakers there’s virtually no discord – a remarkable situation for Philippine Cabinets which are notorious for disagreements and squabbles. This must be one of the most cohesive executives in Philippine Government history.The main reason for that is that, to a Cabinet member, all are fully on board with the Duterte-inspired socio-economic agenda. In short, as far as the economy is concerned, everyone’s on the same page and everyone’s pressing to get things done. It’s just a pity that the legislative branch – specifically the Philippine Senate – doesn’t follow that example.None of this, however, appears in the perspectives provided by the anti-Duterte media. And for the investment community that’s very unhelpful. There’s no question, as far as we’re concerned, the Philippines is on the cusp of achieving great things. It has a well-defined direction and a strong determination. The potential is impossible to ignore.As the mainstream media and the political opposition – wherever they’re from – has been warning of the dangers of Duterte and his policies, The Volatilian™ has been making the case for investing in the Philippines.

"The vaccine’s anticipated impact on dengue burden is expected to stem from its documented ability to prevent 8 out of 10 dengue hospitalizations and up to 93% of severe dengue that includes hemorrhagic dengue fever that can be fatal in vaccinated study participants 9 years and older.That is, persons who have never had dengue before and were inoculated with Dengvaxia, if infected with the dengue virus, will suffer from the disease as if it was their second dengue infection.A healthy individual gets infected with dengue. He suffers from dengue fever and somehow recovers from it. However, if he gets infected again, the secondary dengue fever will be worse than the first. Suffice it to say, secondary dengue has higher mortality rates than primary dengue.Some severe dengue cases result in organ damage (heart, etc).Now, what did Dengvaxia do to the 4th graders who have no history of dengue?Suppose we have a 4th grader who has never been infected with dengue receives Dengvaxia. If that child gets infected with dengue for the first time, that child will suffer from severe dengue instead of just regular dengue.In short, the child would have been better left without the vaccine, as Dengvaxia increases the dengue mortality rates for recipients who have never been infected with dengue.Simply put, Dengvaxia is poison for those who have never had dengue… but Aquino and Garin wanted it anyway.How did this happen?Concealing Critical Information The DoH and Sanofi were not totally honest.First, the vaccine is a lot less effective to those who have never had dengue.If you have had dengue, the vaccine's efficacy is 81 per cent. However, if you have not been infected with dengue before, this figure is only 38 per cent [The vaccine’s effectiveness against those who have previously been infected with dengue is undeniable. However, the vaccine is a lot less effective if the recipient is seronegative for dengue, i.e. the recipient has no traces of dengue virus in his or her bloodstream.Of course, we can argue that having a vaccine that works only 4 out of 10 attempts is better than having no vaccine at all. And this leads us to the second point, which is…Second and more importantly, health experts have been warning the entire time that Dengvaxia may have considerable adverse effects on seronegative recipients.Senator Richard Gordon, after consulting health experts, has already warned against Dengvaxia in as early as 2015. In a December 2015 press release, he said: The DoH and Sanofi were not totally honest.If you have had dengue, the vaccine's efficacy is 81 per cent. However, if you have not been infected with dengue before, this figure is only 38 per cent [ ST ].The vaccine’s effectiveness against those who have previously been infected with dengue is undeniable.

And this leads us to the second point, which is…Senator Richard Gordon, after consulting health experts, has already warned against Dengvaxia in as early as 2015. In a December 2015 press release, he said:“…We talked to several health experts and they told us that they had already warned government long before about the possible adverse effect of the new drug on individuals with no prior history of dengue [ Senate ]”.Gordon’s warnings were bolstered by no less than the March 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report just a few months later and just days before Aquino and Garin launched the Mass Vaccination Program.Ironically, this report appears to have been used as the basis of the Mass Vaccination Program.WHO already said over and over that the vaccine may do more harm than good to recipients who have never had dengue prior to inoculation (seronegative)… and WHO said it multiple times BEFORE Garin’s DoH launched the mass immunization program.My gahd, I heyt drahgs!Issuance of WHO Guidelines The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia on 23 December 2015 but it was put on hold five days later pending the release of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [Despite the lack of WHO guidelines, Garin vouched for Dengvaxia just days after the DFA announcement, in an interview with Karen Davila [ The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia on 23 December 2015 but it was put on hold five days later pending the release of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [ GMA ].Despite the lack of WHO guidelines, Garin vouched for Dengvaxia just days after the DFA announcement, in an interview with Karen Davila [ YT ] in 03 January 2016.At the 1:45 mark, Davila asked:Who is the perfect candidate to receive the dengue vaccine? . . . I've never had dengue. Ako ba, should I be vaccinated anytime? Garin replied: Garin replied:Yes. It's recommended for those nine to 45 years old,” Garin said. Oh crap! From where does Garin derive her blind faith on Sanofi and Dengvaxia?!The Aquino government seems to have changed its mind when the Philippines hosted Dengvaxia’s global launch on 11 February 2016 [The Aquino Administration bought P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia in March 2016. Note that all contracts worth in excess of P50 million require the signature of the President.To give Garin the benefit of the doubt, I presume that Garin used the 17 March 2016 WHO guidelines [The problem: that same WHO document contains so many red flags that Garin willfully ignored.Let me list these red flags down one by one.The Aquino government seems to have changed its mind when the Philippines hosted Dengvaxia’s global launch on 11 February 2016 [ CNN ], or over a month before WHO’s 17 March 2016 publication of its background paper Dengue Vaccines on [ WHO ].The Aquino Administration bought P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia in March 2016. Note that all contracts worth in excess of P50 million require the signature of the President.To give Garin the benefit of the doubt, I presume that Garin used the 17 March 2016 WHO guidelines [ WHO ] to justify the April 04 launch of the mass vaccination program, as they are the only guidelines available at the time.The problem: that same WHO document contains so many red flags that Garin willfully ignored.Let me list these red flags down one by one.Red Flag 1: Warning to TravelersPage 5 of the WHO guidelines states, “in travelers unlikely to have already had dengue, vaccination may be substantially less beneficial (and there is a theoretical risk that it may be harmful).”The WHO document advises AGAINST vaccination of travelers who have never had dengue because it may be harmful. Yes, WHO admits that Dengvaxia may be harmful to those who have never been infected with dengue.Red Flag 2: Vaccination can do harmPage 6 of the WHO guidelines states, “Current data suggest substantially lower benefit of vaccination in seronegative individuals 9-45 years of age. There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination could do harm in this population.”WHO says Dengvaxia is a lot less effective to those who’ve never had dengue, and that it may even be harmful to them.Red Flag 3: Lack of ContraindicationsPage 12 says that according to Dengvaxia’s packaging, the drug should NOT be administered to those with severe allergic reactions, those with immune deficiencies such as HIV or AIDS, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.So why was there no contraindication against those who’ve never had dengue?Red Flag 4: Insufficient number of trial samplesPage 19 states, “The number of severe or hospitalized episodes was too small to undertake meaningful analyses stratifying by other factors.”Again, this is an admission that there weren’t enough samples.Red Flag 5: Severe dengue risk if given to seronegative peoplePage 24 states, “The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true primary... infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)”There. Page 24 of the 17 March 2016 WHO document said what Sanofi said just days ago.There probably are more red flags after page 24 of 67, but I believe that discovering five should have been enough to convince authorities to think twice about Dengvaxia.WHY DID AQUINO’s GARIN IGNORE THEM? It’s interesting to note that on 01 April 2016, the Philippine Daily Inquirer published the article “WHO approves PH rollout of dengue vaccine”, even if WHO only essentially said they tolerate the rollout and that they do not necessarily approve of it.Specifically, WHO-Philippines chief Dr. Gundo Weiler said, “It is the prerogative of a country to license the product [In short, Aquino’s Garin rolled out Dengvaxia in contravention of expert opinion.WHO reinforces warnings As if the 17 March 2016 WHO document wasn’t enough, the WHO issued another document a month later that basically reiterated the warnings.On 14 April 2016, or several days after the Aquino Government launched the mass vaccination program, Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine delivered a report entitled “Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV ‘Dengvaxia®’) Clinical Trial Results to the World Health Organization [According to the report (parentheses supplied),“There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination may be ineffective or may even increase risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in those who are seronegative at the time of first vaccination, regardless of age. However, there are few trial data available on older (aged 9 and up) seronegative participants to address this.” Let’s translate that to plain English:“There is a chance that Dengvaxia may be useless or even increase risk of severe dengue to recipients aged 9 and up who have never had dengue, but there’s an insufficient number of trial subjects to confirm this.” And there’s the trial methodology’s fatal flaw because when translated to really, really plain English, the April 2016 WHO report basically says:Dengvaxia is untested on people aged 9 and older AND have never been infected with dengue. That is, in as far as those aged 9 and up and seronegative are concerned, the drug is UNTESTED.Now, here’s the important question: Page 24 states, “The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true primary... infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)”There.

Dengvaxia recipients can be split into two categories:Seroprevalence, meanwhile, refers to the seropositive proportion of the target population.The studies mentioned in the previous sections indicate that Dengvaxia is considerably effective for seropositive recipients and I will not contest that. The problem, however, is what Dengvaxia does to seronegative recipients.","Thinking Pinoy: #DengGate: Aquinos Garin ignores WHO warnings, risks 700k Filipino kids lives"
"Photo by Tristan Tamayo/ INQUIRER.netIf there’s someone in Phoenix who knows how great of a coach Louie Alas is, it’s RJ Jazul.Sharing a bond since their days in Letran, the 31-year-old couldn’t help but wax nostalgic over his history with the soft-spoken mentor, whom he has reunited with at the Fuel Masters.“I feel younger,” he said. “Since college, we’ve been together and that continued in Alaska.”Jazul has every reason to feel upbeat. After all, his partnership with Alas allowed him to be a part of the Knights squad which won the NCAA title back in 2005, while also a key factor in the Aces’ Finals appearances in the past three years.“We’re all positive here, I know what coach Louie and the coaching staff can do for us,” he said.But with the familiarity also comes responsibility as Jazul will be counted on to make the Fuel Masters’ transition under Alas easier.However, the 5-foot-11 sharpshooter said that the burden should fall on every player in the Fuel Masters roster to fulfill their roles in the new system Alas will implement.“It’s now up to us. Whoever coach you put in, if the players won’t follow, the success wouldn’t come. So we all have to buy-in to the system of coach Louie,” he said.Pressured as Phoenix is to turn things around after a rather lackluster showing last season, Jazul is just keeping the faith on Alas and his teammates as the Fuel Masters prepare for a turnaround conference starting this upcoming 2018 Philippine Cup.“Since I got traded here in Phoenix, I always had that pressure because it’s expected that the team will do good,” he said. “Now that coach Louie is here, it’s still the same. But it’s up to us as a team to deal with it and hopefully in the coming weeks, we’ll figure out where we’ll end up.”","Jazul, Fuel Masters confident of smooth transition under Alas  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"Earthquakes are impossible to predict but, based on historical records, Metro Manila's West Valley Fault is due for the Next Big One within our lifetimes.Following the magnitude 6.7 earthquake that caused devastation in Surigao, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has issued a warning on the “Big One,” a powerful earthquake that could kill thousands of residents of Metro Manila and nearby provinces.Though the earthquake can occur anywhere along the West Valley Fault, including Metro Manila, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake can shake the ground even a hundred kilometers away, which means that it can shake the whole of Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces.The West Valley Fault that runs from the heights of Sierra Madre down to Laguna. It crosses the eastern side of Quezon City, western side of Marikina, western part of Pasig, eastern part of Makati, parts of Taguig, and Muntinlupa.Weak, poorly designed, and poorly constructed buildings far from the earthquake fault are still vulnerable to destruction.Furthermore, the expected movement of Manila trench in the West Philippine Sea might cause a devastating tsunami in the 14 coastal towns of Pangasinan.“Everyone must learn from the recent effects of the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao del Norte. If a similar event happens in a highly urbanized area, the effects can be more devastating,” Phivolcs director Renato Solidum warned.PDRRMC spokesperson Avenix Arenas also said that Bulacan, Metro Manila up to Southern Luzon will the most quake and tsunami affected areas.Recent studies show that a 32-feet-tsunami could be generated by the upcoming disastrous earthquake. Residents in the coastal areas of the affected areas should prepare anytime for the quake could possibly strike anytime.","PHIVOLCS CONFIRMED: ""The Big One"" Earthquake Might Strike Anytime - See Affected Areas!"
"MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines.Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy.First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here.If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor.In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you.Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can’t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat.Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. “Barya lang po sa umaga!” No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please.Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know.If you don’t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant.The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. “God knows who doesn’t pay,” says one jeepney sign.There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: “Bayad po” (here’s my fare) and “Para po” (this is my stop).If you don’t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney’s roof. It also means “please stop.”There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say “one senior” or “one student” when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare.Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn’t that nice?As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.Advertisements",Tutorial: Riding The Philippine Jeepney

"For more than 30 years, Donnie MacNeil has wanted to thank the couple that brought him to the hospital after a traumatic highway accident near Baddeck, N.S.Thanks to social media, this week he finally got to do just that.MacNeil posted to Facebook on Friday, asking if anyone remembered picking him up on Feb. 20, 1986.‘Someone will rescue me’MacNeil said that for 30 years, he had wanted to thank the couple that stopped to help him. (Submitted by Donnie MacNeil)At the time, the 19-year-old MacNeil was driving his red Toyota truck on the highway from Antigonish back to Sydney, N.S., along the south side of Kellys Mountain.For a brief moment, he fell asleep at the wheel. His truck hit the rails of a wooden bridge with such force that a beam ripped through the truck.The impact caused the vehicle to flip and land on its roof in the embankment.“I stayed for a bit thinking, someone will see me, someone will rescue me,” MacNeil said.“It got pretty cold pretty fast and water was coming in and I thought, no, if I’m going to get out of this I’ve got to get myself out.”The wooden beam from the bridge went through the front of the truck. (Submitted by Donnie MacNeil)The door wouldn’t open because of the packed snow, so MacNeil rolled down the window and dug until he could get the door cracked open enough to escape.“I didn’t really know until I started to move that my foot was next to my ear. Something was going on, it wasn’t quite right,” he said.MacNeil hoisted himself up on the undercarriage of the truck and dragged himself across to the bank.“I fell in the brook several times and kind of crawled out through the water and made my way up the side of the beams of the bridge. It took quite a while, probably hours, to do that.”Trying to flag down carsNear the side of the quiet highway, soaking and frozen, and with a leg broken in seven places, MacNeil couldn’t even stand to make himself seen by passing cars.“The cold had pretty much taken all the good out of me,” he said.Michael Maclellan, his then wife Cathy MacNeil and their four-month-old son were driving back to Sydney from Baddeck when Maclellan noticed something in the ditch.He told his wife he thought it was a person lying down with his hand up, so he turned the car around.“Sure enough he was there and he was in bad shape… He was extremely cold, vibrating, because he was soaking wet,” Maclellan said.“It was just fluke that I saw him.”Michael Maclellan and his then wife were driving with their four-month-old son when he spotted something in the ditch. (Submitted by Michael Maclellan)Maclellan said his wife drove to the hospital in Baddeck, while he squeezed in beside MacNeil and tried to keep him warm.MacNeil said his memories after that are foggy. Finally warming up and covered in blood, he could feel the extent of the pain in his leg.“The leg kind of exploded from the knee down. There was no bone left from a couple of inches below my knee to my ankle, both bones in my leg were kind of shattered,” he said.Years of wonderingAt the hospital, Maclellan said they made sure doctors had MacNeil and then, “that was the last I ever heard of him.”“They got me in there,” MacNeil recalled. “The last thing I remember was the guy [Maclellan] coming in looking for some paper towel to get the blood out of his truck.”And then moments later, he came back and asked for a bucket and a mop,” MacNeil said, chuckling.MacNeil was transported to Sydney and spent the next nine months in and out of the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries on his leg.But in the days after the accident, he said he tried to find the couple, asking hospital staff and police. “Nobody seemed to know who these folks were.”Last week, MacNeil drove by the bridge again. And that’s when he decided to try searching for them online. His post was shared 5,500 times and eventually, Cathy MacNeil saw it and shared it with her ex-husband, according to Maclellan.After that, Maclellan and Donnie MacNeil started talking over Facebook.Belated thank youIt turns out, in the summer of 1986, Maclellan and his family moved to Calgary, where he still lives. But every summer, he returned to Cape Breton, and would drive along the bridge and wonder what happened to the man he saved.“He figures I saved his life. I don’t know,” Maclellan said.“We’re not doing much more than anybody else would have done in the same situation. Most people would have gave somebody assistance.”As for MacNeil, “I did get a chance to give my belated thank you. I wasn’t sure if I had done it at the time or not given the state I was in, so I wanted to make sure that was the first thing I did.”Maclellan said he hopes to meet up with MacNeil on his yearly return to Nova Scotia next summer.‘You just dive in’MacNeil, far right, said he has told the story to his children over the years. (Submitted by Donnie MacNeil)MacNeil said the accident is a story he’s told to his children over the years.“I was a young guy, I was 19. I considered myself pretty tough, screw the broken leg I’m going for it,” he said.“That’s kind of how I lived my life ever since. You just dive in.”",Sydney man thanks couple who rescued him after dramatic 1986 crash  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"With just weeks to go before she’s set to deliver twins, Toronto’s Kelsi Hamilton and her husband are busy buying double of everything. Diapers, baby food, cribs, a double stroller — the long list of essentials adds up to big, budget-busting bucks.But what Hamilton didn’t realize — at least until she saw the results of Marketplace’s new cross-border price comparison — is that Canadians often pay way more than Americans for the same baby products sold by the same retailers, both online and in stores.Even after accounting for the exchange rate ($1.29 on Nov. 1), Canadians are charged almost twice as much for certain brands.And experts say the reason for the high prices in Canada could be as simple as this: Retailers charge Canadians so much because they’ve shown they’ll pay it.“It’s not fair to us. It’s the same products. How can they get away with that?” Hamilton says. “It seems like children’s and baby stuff is kind of just rogue and they can do whatever they want and raise prices as much as they want.”Canadian shoppers shocked to see how much less Americans pay0:54Marketplace did a random price check of 21 baby products available online and in stores on both sides of the border. The U.S. price of each product was converted to Canadian dollars and then compared with the price of the same product sold in Canada. Seventeen of the products (81 per cent) were more expensive in Canada; only four were cheaper north of the border.SEE price comparison of all 21 productsThe largest price discrepancy of all the baby products was for the Aquadoodle drawing mat for sale on Amazon.It cost $47.45 in the U.S. But the price tag in Canada was $85.18. That’s an 80 per cent hike for shoppers in Canada, taking into account the exchange rate.There was also a big cross-border price gap for Huggies baby wipes at the online retailer.It was a similar story at traditional brick and mortar stores.The Marketplace team went shopping at a Walmart and Toys “R” Us just outside Toronto at the beginning of November and then went shopping again at both retailers the next day at locations near Buffalo, N.Y.The biggest price difference at Walmart was for the Evenflo Exersaucer. The only model available in Canada was the Bouncing Barnyard Saucer, which cost $89.97. But the Sweet Tea Saucer, which is very similar, cost Americans just $63.70.Some food prices were also cheaper at the Walmart in the U.S.The same goes for games and activities sold at Toys “R” Us.Marketplace’s findings even surprised Ambarish Chandra, assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.He says those kinds of price gaps were typical in a variety of retail sectors when the loonie was much stronger a few years ago. Now that it’s weakened, he says the gaps should get smaller.But that’s not what’s happened with baby products.“You seem to have identified the sector where that’s actually not true,” he says.‘Taking advantage’It’s particularly interesting, he says, because new parents might be the most price-sensitive consumers out there since they have an expensive new family member to feed, clothe and entertain.He says many families with young kids don’t have time to spend hours shopping around at other stores for the best deal or to drive to the U.S. for a diaper run.“And so maybe that’s something firms are aware of, and taking advantage of.”Ambarish Chandra, assistant professor of economics at the University of Toronto, says one way to put pressure on local retailers to lower their prices is for more Canadians to take their business south of the border, if that’s an option. (CBC )And part of the reason they’re able to do that, he suggests, is because Canada is simply a smaller market than the U.S., with higher business costs and less competition.“From the point of view of consumers, it’s not justifiable … but a lot of it is just down to the economics of the situation,” he says. “When firms don’t operate at the same scale, and when they don’t face much competition, they’re going to price as high as they can get away with.”Retailers respondMarketplace asked Walmart, Toys “R” Us and Amazon to explain these price gaps.All three provided statements with a similar message: They work hard to provide the best deals for their Canadian customers, but prices may be higher because of factors such as taxes and import fees, transportation and distribution costs, and local competitive pricing.READ the full statements from the retailers and manufacturersSo what can Canadian consumers do about it?One option, Chandra says, is to do more comparison shopping locally. Another is for those who live relatively close to the border — and have the time and energy — to put pressure on retailers in Canada by shopping in the U.S.He says retailers on this side of the border might be inclined to lower their prices over time if they think they’re losing a big chunk of business.Kelsi Hamilton says she’s found another way to stock up on baby stuff without breaking the bank. She checks out online buy and sell groups, Facebook Marketplace and local mom groups.In fact, she just bought a stroller travel system for twins that includes infant car seats and a double stroller through Kijiji.“It’s brand new and we got it $1,400 cheaper than the retail price. $1,400! We did so much research and the timing just clicked.”",How can they get away with that?: Canadians pay much more than Americans for baby products  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"Duterte to Tax Religious Organizations if they Won’t Stop Meddling on Government AffairsDuterte to Tax Religious Organizations if they Won’t Stop Meddling on Government AffairsPresident Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said that he might ask the Congress to pass a bill requiring all religious group to pay taxes if they won’t stop meddling on government affairs.During a press briefing in Malacañang, Duterte said he almost have enough with the Church leaders, especially the Catholic Bishop Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), for criticizing his war on drugs despite not helping the drug victims.“Walang magawa sa buhay akala mo kung sinong magagaling wala namang alam maliban sa tumanggap ng abuloy. E bakit hindi nila ampunin lahat ng adik jan kung gusto nila?” Duterte said referring to the Catholic priests.The President also hit the Church over its comment on the 15 NPA rebels killed in Batangas during a military operation last week.Kung gusto nila e di sumama sila sa operation. Yan, sila ng CHR, magsama sama sila para pag tinamaan sila ng bala ng mga NPA e di sorry”, Duterte mocking both the CHR and CBCP.“ito kasing mga paring ito, walang ibang alam kungdi ang maki-alam. E kung magbayad kaya sila ng tax sigurado pakikinggan ko pa sila;. Payag ba kayo singilin natin ng tax ang mga pari?” Duterte asked his audience who responded with big round of applause.The CBCP is one of the staunchest critics of the President’s war on drugs that resulted to thousands of casualties since it was implemented right after he won as president last year.Since the anti-drug operation has been returned to the PNP, anti-Duterte groups are again saying that casualties will multiply any time soon. /Joy Valle/",Duterte to Tax Religious Organizations if they Wont Stop Meddling on Government Affairs
"via PEP.PHThe recently concluded Star Magic All Star basketball game held at the Araneta Coliseum ended in controversy as the tension between opposing team members Daniel Padilla and JC De Vera almost escalated into a fight.It started when the two celebrities locked horns in a struggle for the possession of the ball under the ring. In their struggle, JC twisted as Daniel tried to steal the ball but he falls to his knees. He got up unhappy and displayed a reaction that can only be called being upset. He did not swing a punch but instead walked away while muttering something to the referee who was quick enough to intervene.Padilla must've appeared to be very mad so the referee called foul for De Vera. It can be seen in the footage that one of Padilla's teammate was trying to calm him down but he was ignored.The game was temporarily halted because to let things cool down for a bit or risk turning the sport into a brawl that would've ultimately resulted in bruising insured celebrity faces.After the game, leading local entertainment website PEP, interviewed De Vera and asked him about the incident.""Grabe sya. Ganito pala yung laro nya,"" JC said.""Nag-sorry ako. Sabi ko, ‘Sorry bro, tumaas lang emotions ko.’ After the game, nag-sorry ulit ako. Sabi ko pasensya na, hindi ko alam na ganito kayo ka-intense,"" he added.Meanwhile, Padilla also told PEP that he was sorry he acted that way during the game and said, “Ako din nag-sorry ako [kay JC] kasi uminit din ako. Siyempre gusto niyo lahat manalo so hindi mawawala ‘yung competitiveness ng lahat. Pero okay lang kami, no problem.”The game reached its conclusion with the Blue Team winning the game by 3 points.The replay of the game will be aired on TV on August 20 and fans are hopeful to see that moment whenwhich almost turned the game into a brawl.",Daniel Padilla Got Mad and Shoved A Hand on JC De Vera During Star Magic Basketball Game
"OverviewThe 520 error is essentially a “catch-all” response for when the origin server returns something unexpected or something that is not tolerated/interpreted (protocol violation or empty response).While the 520 error can be triggered by very unique and strange edge-case scenarios, they are generally caused by:Connection resets (following a successful TCP handshake)Headers exceed Cloudflare’s header size limit (over 8kb)Empty response from originInvalid HTTP responseHTTP response missing response headersIf any of these conditions above can be confirmed from the webserver hosting the site, then it is recommended to consult with the host provider for assistance with the webserver configuration to avoid further interruption and errors.Common Causes520 errors are generally caused at Layer 7, which is the Application Layer. This means that a 520 error is the result of a bad response coming back from the application. Rate limiting, or filtering requests (e.g. by connecting IP, or volume/frequency) can sometime cause issues with your application.TroubleshootingDue to the nature of the 520 response, it is best to test against the origin server response using a cURL command to confirm if any conditions have been met to trigger the error. This especially true to determine if the origin server is returning an empty reply, invalid HTTP response, or extremely large response headers.Here is an example command used to force the Host HTTP header while sending the request to the source IP where the domain is hosted (in this example we are sending a request for a login page):curl -vso /dev/null --user-agent ""Mozilla 5.0"" -H ""Host: example.com"" http://123.123.123.321/loginHere is an example output where the origin response is an empty reply, which would normally trigger a 520 error if the request was proxied by Cloudflare:* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache* Trying 123.123.123.321...* Connected to 123.123.123.321 (123.123.123.321) port 80 (#0)> GET /login HTTP/1.1> User-Agent: Mozilla 5.0> Accept: */*> Host: example.com>* Empty reply from server* Connection #0 to host 123.123.123.321 left intactA good header might look something like this:* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache* Trying 123.123.123.321...* Connected to 123.123.123.321 (123.123.123.321) port 80 (#0)> GET /login HTTP/1.1> User-Agent: Mozilla 5.0> Accept: */*> Host: example.com>< HTTP/1.1 200 OK< Content-Type: text/html< Date: Day, DD, Month Year Hour:Minute:Second Timezone{ [14240 bytes data]* Connection #0 to host 123.123.123.321 left intactBecause rate limiting can also cause this issue, you will want to whitelist our IPs.

"What do you think of this sad yet inspiring story of Brian Laurence? Let us and other netizens know your thoughts by commenting below!Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you. As difficult as it may seem, you can always choose to let go, move on, and start over. What little strength you think you may have can bring you wonders and blessings if you only let it. This is exactly the story of a certain Brian Laurence, who was originally from New Zealand. At the age of 61, he runs a small business selling vegetables in Kidapawan that he himself grows. Things, however, were not always so good for the old man. He shared his story with a netizen, Joy Dondan, who posted it on Facebook. The post has since garnered 39,000 reactions and 44,477 shares.In her post, Joy told the story of Brian. Brian first came to the Philippines eight years ago to meet a friend whom he met through social media. After a while, their friendship blossomed into a relationship. However, Brian noticed that his lover wanted something else from him. Little by little, she siphoned his money. She told him that she was investing in a business for them, and that the house they were living in was also bought with his money. Brian found out a little too late that none of this was true. They had no investment in any business, and the house they were staying in was apparently only being leased to them. He was soon evicted for failure to pay rent. Brian also found out that his girlfriend was not really a woman, but rather, a man. By that time, he could no longer locate her. With no friends or relatives here in the Philippines, Brian’s future seemed bleak.However, the New Zealand citizen did not let his misfortunes get the better of him. Instead, he chose to live here and start anew. With the help of some friends that he has made in Kidapawan, Brian Laurence started his own small business of growing crops and selling them. He usually goes door to door to sell them, and always makes friends with his new customers. The netizen who posted his story encouraged everyone to buy vegetables from Brian as they are guaranteed fresh and organic. In a video that accompanied the post, a woman can be seen buying a lot of ginger from Brian.When asked why he did not go to his embassy to ask for help so he could return home, Brian Laurence said that he does not want to leave the Philippines yet.As a final note, the netizen then reminded everyone that no matter how big one’s problems may be, one can always overcome it as long as one chooses to.Read the full post below:Read the full post below:",Isang Foreigner Ang Nagtitinda Ng Gulay Dahil Niloko Ng Kanyang Kasintahan Na Pinay

"A new study offers a glimpse into the state of mind of North Atlantic right whales when they are trapped and dying in fishing gear.By measuring hormone levels in the collected feces of the endangered whales, scientists have determined the animals’ stress levels are “sky-high.”“What it tells us is that there is extreme physical trauma and extreme suffering going on,” said Rosalind Rolland, a senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium and the lead author of the study.“Because these hormone levels aren’t just a slight elevation — they are through-the-roof elevated.”‘It’s not a subtle thing, it’s an ‘Oh, my God, this animal is really, really, in trouble.” – Rosalind Rolland, New England Aquarium scientistThe presence of the stress hormones was measured in the feces of 125 individual North Atlantic right whales over 15 years, including six chronically entangled whales, a live stranded whale and five other whales that were killed by ship strikes.Hormone levels, including the textbook “fight-or-flight” hormone cortisol, were recorded as being very high in animals that suffered a slow death but not in those that died suddenly from collisions with vessels.Rolland said the study is the first of its kind to look exclusively at what North Atlantic right whales go through while tangled in fishing lines. Whales have died as a result of the entanglement.“A lot of entanglements occur in this population,” she said. “Eighty-three per cent of this population of North Atlantic right whales has been entangled in fishing gear at some point, and 50 per cent at least twice.”Rosalind Rolland, a senior scientist and veterinarian with the New England Aquarium, says stress levels of whales entangled in fishing gear are ‘sky high.’ (New England Aquarium)As a veterinarian, Rolland said she wasn’t qualified to speak to what similar levels of the stress hormones would be like in humans, but she was able to compare their impact on other animals.“If I saw these types of cortisol levels in a dog or a cat or a horse, I would be completely floored and very alarmed,” Rolland said. “It’s not a subtle thing, it’s an ‘Oh, my God, this animal is really, really, in trouble.'”The North Atlantic right whale population suffered devastating losses this year when 16 of the whales were found dead. There are only about 450 North Atlantic right whales left on the planet.Began with pregnancy hormonesScientists have been collecting feces samples from North Atlantic right whales since 1999.“I got the crazy idea that you could develop a pregnancy test for right whales,” Rolland said. “At that time, the calving rates in this population had just plummeted down to single digits. In fact, there was only one calf born in the year 2000.”Rolland has published papers on the detection of pregnancy hormones, which she said eventually led her to the study of the stress hormones in entangled whales.The process of extracting stress hormones from the whale feces is described as “pioneering” by the New England Aquarium.Tested long-dead whalesAccording to Rolland, the process can be used to not only examine the stress levels of living whales but also on animals that have been dead as long as 15 years.But the process of actually collecting whale feces was made easier by the fact the samples float on the ocean’s surface, and Rolland and her colleagues were aided by tracking dogs.This small, female whale on Miscou Island in New Brunswick died from severe entanglement this summer. (Shane Fowler/CBC)“These are the dogs that have the same training as a narcotics dog, only that you train them on right whale poop,” said Rolland. “And we trained them to work off boats in the water for four years, and they were phenomenal. We collected a lot of samples during those years.”Rolland’s paper “Fecal glucocorticoids and anthropogenic injury and mortality in North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis” was published in Endangered Species Research by the Inter-Research Science Centre.",Feces of entangled North Atlantic right whales show extreme suffering  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"Explorers have just discovered a new underground passage, complete with stalactites and a lake, all buried beneath the city of Montreal — and they don’t know where it ends yet.Until a couple of months ago, no one had ever set foot inside.CBC crews were among the first people who had the chance to explore the cathedral-like chamber, which was formed more than 15,000 years ago during the ice age.Cavers Luc Le Blanc and his friend Daniel Caron couldn’t believe their eyes when they knocked through limestone and discovered this massive chamber beneath Montreal. (Submitted by Société québécoise de spéléologie)The spectacular find is connected to Montreal’s Saint-Léonard Cavern, which lies underneath Parc Pie XII, not far from Highway 40.The main portion of the cavern has been open to members of the public for decades, but tour guides had no idea there had been a massive section hidden behind a limestone wall.The passageway, formed more than 15,000 years ago during the last ice age, runs at least 200 metres long, six metres high, and about three metres wide.“This is a major discovery we made. This doesn’t happen many times in a lifetime,” said Luc Le Blanc, who found the passageway along with his friend Daniel Caron.The chamber is so deep that it reaches the aquifer.The explorers waded through as much of it as possible, before using an inflatable canoe to navigate the five-metre-deep water.“It keeps going. We haven’t reached the end yet,” Le Blanc said.Luc Le Blanc and Daniel Caron, pictured outside the cave, have been exploring underground as a hobby for years. (CBC)Le Blanc and Caron said they were able to pinpoint the location of the passageway using a dowsing rod, similar to the wooden divination tools sometimes used to find groundwater.The two men, who first got into caving as a hobby, said they’ve been searching for an unknown branch of the Saint-Léonard cavern for years.They succeeded in October, when they started to dig through an unremarkable wall, one that tour groups shuffle past every summer.“We started digging in a decomposed layer of limestone that was much softer … We managed to open a window through which we could see the void beyond,” Le Blanc said.Now that small window has been expanded to a narrow tunnel, only large enough for an adult to crawl through.Crawling through this narrow hole leads you to the ceiling of a massive chamber, which you then access by climbing down a ladder. (CBC)Le Blanc said the discovery is significant not just because of the chamber’s size, but because of the way the cave was formed.“The walls opened through the pressure of the glacier above … it’s a mechanical process through a glacier. It’s been called glacial tectonism.”Le Blanc can’t wait to keep exploring the rest of the cave.“It’s just beautiful.”Borough officials do hope to eventually open it up to the public, once the proper surveys and reports have been completed.","Step inside these 15,000-year-old caves in Montreal  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"A professional photographer who goes by the name Hyson Hilario faces scandal as a woman who claimed she was taken advantaged of by him during a supposed photoshoot came forward and seek Raffy Tulfo In Action's help.Raffy Tulfo the said program's host allowed the victim 'Maris' (not her real name) to recount what transpired during the photoshoot with Hilario. According to her, the photographer touched her private parts and 'ate' her.She said that he forced himself on to her inside a motel room where the supposed photo shoot took place. The photographer also allegedly took pictures of her in a compromising position as he was taking advantage of her.She also said she was reluctant to come forward and report the incident at first because Hilario blackmailed her, threatening to spread her photos if she tells anyone of what he did to her.Maris eventually decided to come forward and asked Raffy Tulfo In Action for help. Tulfo made contact with the photographer in question and allowed him to air his side. During their phone conversation, Hilario admitted doing the things he was being accused of.This prompted Tulfo and the victim to proceed to file a case at Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. According to Tulfo, several other women who were also models and past subjects for photo shoots with Hilario, also came forward adding their own complaint against him.One other victim claims that she was penetrated by Hilario against her will during a photo shoot with him.Raffy Tulfo In Action obtained a screenshot from of Hilario's chat conversation where he admits 'eating' the complainant for 10 minutes:He also claims that there is no proof that he forced himself on the model and that she wanted it too:Apparently, Hyson Hilario uses his profession in photography as a way to get women.

"Finance Minister Bill Morneau is facing a call for an investigation into his failure for two years to disclose one of his private corporations to Canada’s ethics watchdog.In a letter to Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson, Conservative MP Peter Kent asks her to take a closer look at SCI Mas des Morneau, a company incorporated in France that owns and manages Morneau’s villa in the picturesque town of Oppède in France’s Provence region. Morneau and his wife, Nancy McCain, are listed as partners.While Morneau’s office says the finance minister had previously told Dawson about the villa, he only disclosed the private corporation on Sept. 22 after CBC News began asking questions about it.The disclosure came a decade after the company was incorporated and nearly two years after Morneau was named finance minister.Members of Parliament are supposed to disclose any private companies they own anywhere in the world to Dawson’s office. Any private companies disclosed to the ethics commissioner’s office are listed in the public registry of ethics filings located on the commission’s website.Morneau’s villa under attack in QP1:18Call for investigationMorneau’s office has said the failure to disclose the private corporation was the result of “early administrative confusion.”In a letter dated Oct. 13, Kent asks Dawson whether Morneau ever disclosed the private corporation to her office and whether he misled her office “about the nature of his private interests in France.”“In light of these serious questions as a result of public disclosures made by Mr. Morneau, I would like to request that you initiate an investigation into Mr. Morneau’s private corporation in France and whether or not he is in contravention of the Conflict of Interest Act.”Conservative MP Peter Kent says if anyone should disclose all their assets it should be a finance minister. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)In an interview with CBC News, Kent said it is important for Morneau to disclose everything he owns.“There’s probably no single minister other than the prime minister for whom clear and timely and honest disclosure is more important than for the finance minister.”Kent said Morneau’s failure to respect the rules requiring him to disclose all of his private corporations could shake public confidence in his integrity.Kent said arguing the failure to disclose was an oversight or the fault of a staff member is not acceptable.Morneau’s villa is located in the picturesque town of Oppède, France (Shutterstock / Magdanatka)Most Canadians can’t afford the kind of high-priced financial advisers who would counsel them to own a villa in France through a company rather than directly, Kent added.“Only the wealthiest have reason to engage expensive tax advisers to protect their wealth,” Kent said.Reached by CBC News on Sunday, Morneau’s office said they will work with Dawson.“Since becoming a public office holder, the Minister has been working with the Ethics Commissioner and will continue to work with her office to ensure full compliance with the spirit and the letter of the rules,” said press secretary Chloe Luciani-Girouard.Heat over proposed tax changesMorneau’s own financial affairs have been in the spotlight in recent weeks as the opposition has increased its attacks over his proposed changes to the tax rules that apply to private corporations.The Conservatives have been dragging the giant Morneau Shepell human resources company that Morneau used to head into their Question Period attacks. The opposition points out that the proposed tax changes will hit small businesses, farms and professionals like doctors but not large companies traded on the stock exchange like Morneau Shepell.The town of Oppède is located in the southern French region of Provence (Shutterstock / Pack-Shot)On Monday, Morneau’s proposed changes to the tax rules are expected to be in the spotlight when Liberal MPs gather for a special early-morning caucus meeting. Some MPs have been critical of the proposed changes and they are returning from a week in their ridings where some may have received an earful from those opposed to the changes.Morneau has suggested he is open to amendments and is expected to give MPs an idea Monday of just what he is prepared to change to calm the controversy.CBC News has confirmed that will include following through on the Liberals’ campaign promise to cut the small business tax rate to nine per cent from 10.5 per cent.",Kent calls on ethics commissioner to investigate Morneau over corporation that holds French villa  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"San Antonio Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge, left, blocks the shot of Phoenix Suns’ T.J. Warren during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Dec. 9, 2017, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso)PHOENIX, Arizona—San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich says Bryn Forbes has “never seen a shot he didn’t like.”There was one in particular that both of them must have loved Saturday night.Forbes sank his only 3-pointer of the night with 21.5 seconds to play and the severely depleted Spurs held off a fourth-quarter Phoenix rally to beat the Suns 104-101.“It was our fifth game in seven nights, on the road, had a back-to-back to end it all,” Popovich said. “I thought we were pretty tired, but I thought they hung in as well as they could.”The Spurs left Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili home to rest after a victory over Boston on Friday night and had Danny Green (left groin tightness) and Kyle Anderson (left MCL sprain) out with injuries.Still, they led by as many as 19 points in the third quarter before the Suns came back to take their first lead of the night, 100-99, on Marquese Chriss’ breakaway dunk with 1:32 to go after a San Antonio turnover.Josh Jackson made one of two free throws to boost the Phoenix lead to 101-99 with 29 seconds remaining before Patty Mills got the ball to Forbes, who made his lone 3 in six tries.“I think every shot is going in,” Forbes said. “He (LaMarcus Aldridge) set a great screen and got me wide open. I couldn’t have asked for a better screen. Patty put it right in my shot pocket. That is what he told me to say. He made a great pass.”Phoenix’s Mike James scored 25 points, one shy of his career high, but missed a 3-pointer, the Spurs got the rebound and Mills sank two free throws with 1.6 seconds to play.Jared Dudley’s 3 from the corner went off the side of the backboard at the buzzer.Mills and Aldridge scored 20 apiece for San Antonio in its fourth straight win and eighth in nine games. T.J. Warren scored 19 of his 24 points in the second half for the Suns, who fell to 0-2 since losing Devin Booker to a left adductor strain that is expected to sideline him two to three weeks.“Took us 24 minutes to find a group that would play with the right energy,” Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. “I mean, we just seemed to be a step slow. You know, I was mixing guys in and out trying to look for offense, defense, anything that would give us some juice and finally got it in the second half.”San Antonio led by as many as 15 in the first half and 19 in the third quarter before a 12-2 Suns surge to cut the Spurs’ lead to 71-69 on Troy Daniels’ 3-pointer from the corner with 53 seconds left in the period. But Mills made two 3s in the final 10 seconds of the quarter and San Antonio led 79-71 entering the fourth.Warren rattled in a 3 to punctuate another 12-2 surge that made it tied it 94-94 for the first time since it was 2-2.Aldridge said it was good to have to “learn how to execute down the stretch with different guys.”“A lot of these guys haven’t been in that type of moment, haven’t been in the game down the stretch,” he said. “We had some mistakes but just helping these guys get better and having them be in those types of moments is something that is going to make us better down the stretch.”",Depleted Spurs beat Suns for 8th win in 9 games  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"“The message that the Church receives from this account of the life of Christ is very clear. God did not send his Son into the world to punish sinners, nor to destroy the wicked,” he continued. “They are instead addressed the invitation to conversion so that, seeing the signs of divine goodness, they can find their way back.”The Pope concluded his catechesis by urging those present to not place themselves above the mercy of Christ by believing in a false image of the Messiah.“We Christians believe in the God of Jesus Christ, and our desire is to grow in the living experience of the mystery of love,” he said. “We commit ourselves, therefore, to not place any obstacle in the way of the action of the merciful Father, but we ask the gift of a great faith to become ourselves signs and instruments of mercy.”",Pope Francis: Don't use God to defend your own interests
"The secretary-general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, shared a story of his approach to the illegal drug problem when he was prime minister of Portugal. With three international drug conventions as his guide, he said he implemented non-criminal responses to the possession of drugs for personal use. He allocated more resources for the prevention of drug abuse, treatment and social reintegration programs.Today Portugal has one of the lowest drug-related death rates in Europe, according to Guterres. HIV incidence from injecting drugs has fallen dramatically from 2001 when the country had the highest rate in Europe, he added. Overall rates of drug use and all sexually transmitted diseases have also declined, he said.Guterres reported these accomplishments as part of his message as UN chief on the observance of International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking – a special day on June 26 approved by the UN General Assembly in December 1987. This year, the theme of the annual observance is “Listen First – Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.”The thrust of the initiative is to boost drug abuse prevention using science-based approaches and respecting human rights. The use of lethal force of course cannot be junked entirely in fighting violent drug traffickers. But the experiences of other countries have shown that human rights also cannot be overlooked, especially in dealing with drug abusers.Guterres is not the first former head of state to emphasize that the drug problem cannot be licked mainly by executing drug suspects. Last February, former Colombian president Cesar Gaviria wrote in an opinion piece that force alone could not win the drug war. Gaviria, whose country is the world’s top exporter of cocaine, also noted that he was seeing his mistakes being repeated by President Duterte in the war on drugs.Duterte responded by calling Gaviria an “idiot.” Guterres has a gentler reminder to the international community, especially in dealing with drug abusers. The UN chief has some measure of success to back his argument.",EDITORIAL  Listen first  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"When I read books about the future, it seems that the next generation will grow up in a world that is almost impossible to imagine – robot performing surgical operations and caring for old people. Homes and even kitchen appliances have to be protected from cyber attacks. Ubiquitous sensors all over the place will remove privacy.I think of how the smartphone and the internet has become part of every day life – from the poorest to the richest. Just as radio, then television, then the internet changed lives so will artificial intelligence create more revolutionary changes. It will affect the jobs that will remain for human; and it will even influence moral standards.I worry most about the future of my grandchildren whose lives are going to be impacted by the time they become adults. Diego is seven years old. Emilio is four years old and Nana is two years old. They will face an entirely different set of opportunities and challenges than the one I encountered when I was growing up and even from the one their parents went through growing up.In his book Industries of the Future, Alec Ross interviewed several people on how to best educate the next generation. Most of the people he interviewed emphasized the importance of learning languages – one a traditional language like English, Mandarin or Spanish and the other one a technical language.Investor Charlie Palippahatiya says: “ That’s the one important thing that we have decided, that languages are really important to facilitate an understanding of the world, both the physical in which we live as well as the technical world we will live.”Jack Dorsey presents a different case. He says you learn a programming language for a different reason: “I don’t think you do it to become an engineer or to become a computer programmer; you do it because it teaches you to think in a very different way. It teaches about abstractions, about breaking problems into small parts and then solving them, around systems, and how systems interact. So these are all tools you will use everywhere, especially about building a business, or running a business or even working in a business. If you can synthesize a massive complex business into something that is essential that you can articulate in a very crisp way, that’s exactly what programming teaches you.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Google’s Eric Scmidt said: “The biggest issue is really the development of analytical skills. Most of the routine things people do will be done by computers, but people will manage the computers.”Alec Ross believes that the distance between the traditional liberal arts fields and engineering fields will begin to collapse. Jared Cohens writes: “Why should I have to be a political scientist or a computer scientist? Why is there not a hybrid between the two? Why is it that I have to be a historian or an English major or an electrical engineer? Why is it that there is a need for a more interdisciplinary approach that merges the sciences and the humanities in a way that prepares kids for a world where those silos are beginning to be broken down.”Today’s youth that will enter tomorrow’s workforce will need to be more nimble and more familiar with the broader workings of the world to find a niche they can fit into. With robotics automating labor that is cognitive and nonmanual, tomorrow’s labor market will be increasingly characterized by competition between humans and robots. In tomorrow’s workplace either humans are telling robots what to do or robot are telling humans what to do.The growing economic diversity and increasing pace of change means that investors and people in the global businesses will have to be as mobile and able to work across cultures as people newly entering the workforce. The innovation and creation of new companies that is just now beginning to take place in robotics, genomics, cyber, big data and new fields made possible by the code-ification of money, markets and trust will spring from the world’s principal or alpha cities. But they will also come from places that open up economically, politically and culturally.It is the obligation of those who are in positions of power and privilege to shape our policies to extend to as many people the opportunities that will come with the industries of the future.* * *Email: elfrencruz@gmail.com",Educating the next generation  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"The diplomatic reception last Thursday that served as my first public engagement and marked my formal introduction to the officials of the State Department, members of the Washington diplomatic corps and policy analysts, allowed me to renew old friendships and establish new ones. It was good to meet Ambassador Nathan Alexander Sales who is the State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Scott Busby, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Felter, as well as Representatives Bobby Scott of Virginia and Madeleine Bordallo of Guam.My assumption as Philippine Ambassador to Washington is certainly auspicious and timely, with President Donald Trump’s recent trip to Asia giving reassurance that the US is solid in its commitment to the region and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Likewise, the rapport between President Trump and President Duterte further reaffirmed and strengthened the foundation for the decades-long alliance and friendship between the Philippines and the United States.Together with our team at the Embassy, we expect to foster a deeper and more dynamic partnership between the two nations in terms of economic, security and people-to-people relationships. The latter of course is a key area that we will also focus on considering the estimated four million Filipino-Americans who make up a large and important segment in the US. Both Presidents Duterte and Trump recognize the strong personal relationships and the numerous institutions that enhance the connection between Filipinos and Americans.We obviously have very strong common interests and shared concerns, like terrorism and illegal drugs, which is the main focus of our attention. The clear messaging for us to US officials especially at the US Congress is to emphasize the dangerous link between terrorism and the illegal drugs trade. The attack in Marawi City by ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups against our Armed Forces, and how these terrorists got their resources, was very clear and confirmed by US intelligence operatives.The other day, I met with the Executive Committee of the US-Philippines Society, a non-profit group that was established in 2012, for the purpose of elevating the profile of the Philippines in the United States. USPS founding director Tom Hubbard is an old friend of mine, having had numerous activities with him during his tour of duty as US Ambassador to the Philippines. Joining Tom were USPS president Ambassador John Maisto, executive director Hank Hendrickson, and former Deputy State Secretary and Ambassador to the Philippines John Negroponte (who co-chairs the organization with Manny Pangilinan).In my view, the US-Philippines Society is a good institution that could help the Philippines especially in the area of trade and people-to-people relationships as it seeks to highlight the many opportunities that the Philippines has to offer in terms of business and investments. The series of economic reforms undertaken by the Philippines has provided the momentum that has made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. For nine consecutive quarters, expansion exceeded six percent, and growth last quarter was at 6.9 percent.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1The growth and resilience displayed by the Philippines makes it a very promising investment destination especially with the continued efforts of the Duterte administration to open up the economy to more foreign participation. Aside from that, the Philippines has a young and dynamic population – a demographic sweet spot as Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez describes it – along with an ambitious infrastructure program with vital projects worth $170 billion that will be rolled out in the next five years.The informal Trade and Investment Framework Agreement or TIFA meeting between trade delegates from the Philippines and the US was also very encouraging, with preliminary discussions centering on the prospects for a bilateral Free Trade Agreement. Updates on key trade policy issues and concerns regarding market access were also reviewed.President Duterte on many occasions has stated that the Philippines is America’s best friend in Asia. This will be our guiding light as our team at the Embassy will work to ensure that the partnership between the United States and the Philippines remains to be a clear and decisive commitment to the principles that underpin the alliance. We look forward to bright prospects ahead, and I have every confidence that we will be successful in our mission with the support and partnership of leaders in the US government, the Fil-American community, our friends and all stakeholders.* * *Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has instructed our consulate in Los Angeles to provide assistance in every way we can to Filipinos who are along the path of wildfires affecting Southern California – 125,000 Filipinos live in these areas alone.

We were told by some firefighters that containment will have to be done by air, but erratic winds have spread the fires so fast, with plumes of smoke being blown towards the ocean and obscuring visibility badly in the process.Our consulate general in Los Angeles headed by Consul General Adelio Cruz is on top of monitoring the situation and coordinating with concerned government agencies.

"Big Bang’s T.O.P. AFP FILE PHOTOSouth Korean pop star T.O.P received Thursday a 10-month suspended jail sentence for smoking marijuana multiple times last year, weeks after being hospitalized for a drugs overdose.The 29-year-old rapper of K-pop boy band Big Bang had admitted in court to smoking marijuana on four occasions in his home in Seoul last October.“As Choi has admitted to the charges, he is found guilty,” Yonhap news agency cited a Seoul judge as saying, referring to the singer by his real name, Choi Seung-Hyun.The judge added that crimes related to drugs require stiff punishment as they can have a “negative effect” on overall society, but said the singer’s deep regret over his actions had been taken into account.Arriving at the court, Choi told reporters that he “sincerely regretted causing trouble” and apologized to his fans.Both recreational and medical use of marijuana is illegal in South Korea, and smoking the banned substance is a crime punishable for up to five years in prison or a 50 million won (US$44,500) fine.A day after being indicted on the charges of smoking marijuana last month, Choi was hospitalized following an apparent tranquilizer drugs overdose.Choi, who had been serving mandatory military service as a policeman since February, now faces a police disciplinary review on whether he can resume his duties or be dishonorably discharged.More than 60 years after the end of the Korean War, every South Korean man between the age of 18 and 35 is required to perform two years of military service.Big Bang is one of Korea’s most popular boy bands, having sold more than 140 million records worldwide since their debut in 2006.

"As a Belgian author,with little or no restrictions on my,online freedom, I cannot begin to imagine how it must feel,knowing that there is an entire world governmental diplomats forbid you to discover.Sites like Google.com,Twitter.com,Facebook.com,Bbc.c.uk,Wikileaks.org,Youtube.com, vimeo.com,Bing.com and remarkably thetibetpost.com, more about that in a sec.The following was said,during a 2 hour long interview by an expert in Chinese,censorship who has been locked up in china on his holiday for telling,people the truth and questioning the authorities. He wishes to remain anonymous as these impressions and statements,could be harmful when traced back to him. This is the essence and I did paraphrase,his words so some of it may seem out of context.“The good people of China are,among the most indoctrinated I’ve ever seen, nothing about the way they defend their government seems somewhat,genuine. It looks like they are wired to have a sense of hatred toward the Tibetan people. They are continuously,lied to by the government at every opportunity they get and they are censored,themselves on Sina Weibo, the government-controlled social network. I got arrested when,interviewing a local police officer who felt my behaviour was unethical and downright evil. When in custody , I had the chance to talk to inmates,who had been through roughly the same thing. In our cell block, there,were no murderers to be found, no rapists nor psychopaths. We were all just asking the wrong,questions at the wrong time and place. The stories I heard were those of Tibetans,getting captured for vague reasons and released after two months and all of these prisoners were found dead 1 year later and no one could,link those deaths to the Chinese anymore due to the leap in time. I was struck with fear and,hatred toward the Chinese people who just keep on living their lives and who don’t question,the authorities. This censorship is of course a violation of the human rights and organisations,such as amnesty are trying their best to fight this. It almost seems ridiculous how openly they abuse,freedom rights for example Liu Xiaobo Who won the nobel prize for peace (because of his work on fighting,the government) whilst in captivity, oh the irony .”GreatFire is a secretive organisation,that monitors the censored,messages on Sina Weibo and posts them on freeweibo.com for the world to see. The activists,think that the way they made the app renders it impossible to be blocked by the,government. They hope that will show others an effective way to avoid Chinese internet,restrictions, whilst furthering their goal of ending online censorship in China. GreatFire was founded in 2011 by three guys who wish to remain,anonymous in fear of China’s revenge. So how did they bypass the internet,restrictions? They hosted FreeWeibo on amazon’s cloud hosting service, It cannot be blocked,because of the businesses that rely on amazon .

"Eddy Zillan is an 18-year-old high school senior in Cleveland. He loves going to car shows and he plans to attend dental school after he graduates to become an orthodontist. In many ways, he’s like most students his age except for the fact that he’s made a fortune buying and selling cryptocurrencies.In about three years, Zillan has turned about $12,000 US into more than $500,000. It all started with gifts he got at 13.“A portion of the money I received for my bar mitzvah, I used it to fund my investments,” he says in an interview on Nov. 30. “Also, I used to work as a tennis instructor and I invested that money as well.”Ether and bitcoin prices share a similar trajectory. (Coinbase)Chances are you’ve heard about bitcoin and its meteoric rise and wild price swings. Zillan looked into bitcoin years ago but decided to invest most of his cash in another, lesser-known virtual currency invented in 2013 by Russian Canadian Vitalik Buterin called ether.After months of research and talking to people who knew a lot more than he did about virtual currencies, Zillan decided to put his money on ether.“I thought that maybe there was something like bitcoin but different, which there was. It’s called ether,” he says. “I realized that it could have a lot of potential.”Luckily for Zillan, ether has seen its price spike more or less in tandem with bitcoin’s. But the price of ether has gone up more than 5,000 per cent in the last year, while bitcoin’s price has shot up about 2,000 per cent.“I don’t want to disclose the exact amount because its value is going up and down and some days it might increase a lot,” Zillan says. “But I would say just off of ether, I’ve probably made over half a million dollars based on its current price of $471.” (Ether’s price fluctuates and soared to as much as $479 and as low as $420 on Friday.)Ether, like bitcoin, has seen a dramatic increase in value over the last year. (Ethereum)Ether’s advantage over bitcoinEther is the payment system used on the Ethereum platform, which is the brainchild of Buterin. Think of it as bitcoin’s less famous, arguably smarter cousin.Like bitcoin, it’s a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it isn’t backed by a government, central bank or some other authority. It’s supported by a network of sophisticated computer servers located around the world. Like bitcoin, it is mined by people who use computers to solve increasingly difficult math problems in order to earn a piece of the currency.And like bitcoin, both cryptocurrencies are underpinned by a technology called blockchain; they each have their own version of blockchain.But the differences between the two are what caught Zillan’s attention. Ether is the “fuel” for Ethereum, which is a platform for developers who want to create highly-secure blockchain applications.Vitalik Buterin co-founded Ethereum as a teenager in Toronto. (John Phillips/TechCrunch/Getty Images)“People investing in bitcoin and Ethereum see them achieving different objectives and they see them both to be valuable,” says Hilary Carter. She’s the director of faculty at the Blockchain Research Institute in Toronto.Carter says ether and bitcoin are both recognized as forms of payment. But where ether has the edge is its smart contracts. These allow the seller and the buyer of ether to attach conditions to payment.A simple example would be using a smart contract that says if your dog walker performs the agreed-upon-service on specified dates, then they get paid a predetermined amount. But the potential applications go far beyond that.“On Ethereum, we can build platforms which will allow us to vote, we’ll be able to create music on the Ethereum blockchain and have our rights protected, our contracts negotiated,” Carter says.Volatility is the ‘nature of the beast’But all of this is, for now at least, a concept. The technology is there, in its infancy perhaps, but it needs improvement and wider adoption. Carter says these question marks around ether and bitcoin are part of the reason their prices fluctuate so much.“All cryptocurrencies have a tremendous amount of volatility about them. It’s just the nature of the beast,” she explains. “This is experimental technology and with that comes the ups and the downs.”Zillan is convinced that the future is ether. He’s started a company designed to teach people about virtual currencies.“With cryptocurrencies, I see myself trading and continuing to trade up until.… Well, there’s no limit on it,” he says. “And I see the market going up and up and up.”","Well, theres no limit on it: Ohio student makes a fortune buying Canadian-invented ether cryptocurrency  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"

He said even other members of the PSG were unaware of the shooting until Gonzaga's wife found the body.The wife reportedly said she and Gonzaga were not facing any problems apart from the latter’s heavy workload, Dagoy told reporters.Gonzaga was in charge of the security force's operations and was not one of the president's personal guards, he added.The PSG said it ""does not want to speculate"" on the cause of Gonzaga's death.It said it ""will wait for the official findings"" of the Scene of the Crime Operatives, as it respects the privacy of Gonzaga's family.In a press briefing earlier on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella also said the circumstances of the incident have yet to be determined.""Of course it's a matter of concern. However, we need to clarify exactly what it was all about. We don't know the exact nature of the incident so we need to be able to find out exactly what it was,"" said Abella.He also said he has no information on where President Rodrigo Duterte was when the incident happened. – with a report from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com",PSG officer found dead in Malacaang Park

"Four people are feared dead after tsunami waves struck the coast of Greenland on Saturday night.A 4.1-magnitude earthquake, which struck 28 kilometres north of the northwest village of Nuugaatsiaq, is believed to have partially triggered the tsunami, according to a report from Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, the national broadcaster in Greenland.The local newspaper, Sermitsiaq, reported that the four feared dead were inside their home in Nuugaatsiaq when waves struck and swept the structure into the ocean.KNR says Nuugaatsiaq has been evacuated, adding the waves also struck the communities of Uummannaq and Illorsuit.

"Jim Paredes, a vocal critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, is recorded to have said back in 2006, 20 years after the EDSA People Power movement, that he wanted a “strong leader” who “bends rules a little bit” and a kind of government that can “knock down some people” after his dismay at the Cory Aquino government that he described as “masyadong nagpapogi, masyadong nagpa-pressure, masyadong, ah…it was too accommodating.”The Duterte administration is plagued with allegations of extrajudicial and vigilante killings attributed to its aggressive anti-drug war campaign which is pivotal to protests of anti-Dutertes. Although himself anti-Duterte, Paredes said back then that “there is injustice if you don’t do justice anyway. There is injustice in not catching crooks. So, err on the side of zealousness. I would have gone that way, anyway,” and when he was asked if that means lining up the crooks against a wall and shooting them, he replies, “Oh, that would be nice, too. You know what? I wouldn’t cry over it if it happened.”His dismay at the Aquino government stemmed from the fact that it squandered the leadership that the Filipinos gave to them after EDSA. The reforms and changes that the people wanted actualized were held at bay and corruption, debts, and various coup attempts emerged.“I don’t think they were as bold as the people wanted them to be…masyadong nagpapogi, masyadong nagpa-pressure,” Paredes said “they should have run to the people. But [they didn’t because] what happens is that when you sit in government, the people don’t count anymore. It’s the other forces that count — the armed forces, the politicians, the moneyed, business. The people don’t count. They should have run to the people and the people would have protected them.”It is clear that Paredes wanted a revolution for the Philippines back in his 2006 interview. When asked about his opinion on the possible repercussions that a strong government would have on the people’s freedoms, Paredes boldly commented that “there is no such thing as absolute artistic freedom, any freedom. Freedom is relative. I would be willing to be more responsible about it…but I will not give it up. If it is the government’s duty to curb (artistic freedom), then let them curb it but I will not give it up.”Paredes felt in the era of a post-Marcos regime that the only way for liberal democracy to work is “with a strong leader” reasoning that “kung malakas-lakas yung leader mo, who can sort of – I mean, to pardon the expression – can sort of kick ass, no, matatakot ka to tangle with a strong President eh, kahit Senate President ka pa.”He even said that if a strong leader who embodies those qualities would emerge, he “would be willing to give that leader a chance”, however all his conclusive statements about a revolution in 2006 wavers in the face of issues bombarding him now.He lambasted Pro-Duterte supporters and decries the President for the so-called authoritarian rule despite being ready to support this style of government more than a decade ago.As Correctphilippines.org said about Paredes’ change of heart, something went wrong with him along the way and somehow the Yellows got him.",Public Trending

"A group huddles around a collection of large black-and-white portraits strewn across a table at the armoury in Kamloops, B.C.Peering through magnifying glasses, they search for a specific face among the rows of troops dressed in identical uniforms.They are looking for a soldier they never knew, who fought and died in a battle most have never heard of.“It was a Chinese-Canadian kid from 100 years ago, volunteering to participate in a war,” said Jack Gin, a philanthropist with a love of history. “I was astounded to learn of this Frederick Lee person.”Jack Gin had never heard about Frederick Lee or the battle of Hill 70 until he received an email in the spring asking for his help to research Lee’s story. (Chris Corday/CBC)Lee was one of only a few hundred Chinese Canadians who enlisted during the First World War.While he fought at the famous battle of Vimy Ridge, his name recently surfaced because of research that was done to commemorate a much lesser known battle in northern France.An unknown part of historyAround 100,000 Canadian soldiers — Lee included — fought at Hill 70.“It was a remarkable battle that was largely forgotten,” said Mark Hutchings, chairman of the Hill 70 Memorial project.Hutchings believes the battle, which took place four months after Vimy Ridge, deserves the same kind of reverence in Canadian history.It was the first time Canadian forces were led by a Canadian commander.A shell bursts during the battle of Hill 70 near Lens, France, in August 1917. (Canadian War Museum)The British asked Sir Arthur Currie to attack the Germans at the French town of Lens and create a diversion that would prevent them from moving troops into Belgium, where the Allies were planning a larger offensive.Hutchings says Currie pushed to change plans after doing reconnaissance of the area.“He went and had a look and said, oh, this would be a meat grinder, we would be doomed to fail the same way the French failed, the British failed,” he said.Currie believed that the Canadians should instead try attacking the higher ground north of Lens — an area that was named Hill 70 because it was 70 metres above sea level.The British agreed, and as dawn broke on Aug. 15, 1916, the Canadian Corps launched its attack.As chairman of the Hill 70 project, Mark Hutchings has worked to develop the memorial park and an educational program that will be rolled out in schools. (CBC)Battle for Hill 70Within hours, they were able to gain the higher ground, and over the next 10 days the Germans launched 21 counterattacks.It was a bloody battle, and a devastating loss for the Germans, Hutchings says: there were between 20,000 to 40,000 German casualties, “depending on which history you read.”On the Canadian side, 1,877 men were killed including 21-year-old Lee, who died on the sixth day of the battle. His name is etched on the Vimy Ridge memorial, and he is one of more than 11,000 Canadians who were killed in action in France and whose final resting place is unknown.His Chinese heritage meant that Frederick Lee wasn’t able to vote, but that didn’t stop him from enlisting with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, to fight for Canada overseas. (Courtesy Norman Lee)While the Canadian Corps’ accomplishment at Vimy is a storied and celebrated part of Canada’s history, the victory at Hill 70 is largely unknown.Since 2012, a group of volunteers has been working to change that, and on August 22, the Hill 70 Memorial Park will open in France, one hundred years after the First World War battle.The site is about 15 kilometres from the Vimy Ridge memorial and features a white limestone obelisk and a pathway marked with 1,877 maple leaves.The newly dedicated #Hill70 Memorial stands on the last piece of land donated by France for WWI battle recognition. pic.twitter.com/ffmUyeozyb — @GGDavidJohnstonGin and his group are fundraising to build another walkway which would wind to the top of the hill and be named after Frederick Lee.“It would be symbolic,” said Gin who has been helping to research Lee’s story.“I see Frederick Lee as a metaphor for the hard work and struggle for the early Chinese.”Wide-spread discriminationLee was born in Kamloops in 1895. Those researching his story have discovered that he was one of eight children in his family. His father had migrated to Canada to work as a gold miner but eventually became a merchant.Gin said even though Kamloops had a strong Chinese community back then, there was deep, widespread discrimination.“They weren’t allowed to own property on one side of the river. They weren’t even allowed to bury their dead in the city cemetery,” said Gin.Lee poses for a photo at a camp in Vernon, B.C., with other members of the machine gun section of the 172nd Battalion in 1916. (Canadian War Museum)Even their children — born in Canada — were not allowed to vote.Despite that, Lee, who had been working as a farmer, signed up for the Canadian Expeditionary force in 1916 and joined the 172nd battalion. He trained as a machine gunner within the unit before heading to France.Honouring Lee at homeHis name is carved into the stone cenotaph in Kamloops alongside other local soldiers who were killed in the First World War. But many didn’t realize he was part of the city’s Chinese community until only recently because Lee can also be an English name.“We should be so proud of him,” said Elsie Cheung, president of the Kamloops Chinese Freemasons.Members of the Chinese community in Kamloops didn’t realize that one of their own fought during the First World War. After hearing Lee’s story, they have been trying to track his family history. (Chris Corday/CBC)Another fundraising effort is underway to build a gazebo at the city’s Chinese cemetery.It would be perched at the top of a small hill, looking over more than 200 graves, many which are marked with simple wood stakes.“It’s amazing,” she said.“He counted himself as a Canadian, even if he wasn’t recognized as a Canadian.”After learning about his story a few months ago, she has spent hours looking into Lee’s family history.The name “Fred Lee” is engraved on the cenotaph in Kamloops, but Elsie Cheung says no one realized he was part of the Chinese community until they received an email from those organizing the Hill 70 project. (Chris Corday/CBC)Cheung discovered that Lee’s father died and his mother and most of his siblings returned to China even before Lee enlisted.She found that Lee has an 85-year-old nephew still living in Kamloops, and her goal now is to try and track down his family living in China.“I would love to reach out to them and tell them about his story in Canada.”","100 years on, forgotten WWI Canadian victory at Hill 70 memorialized  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"Using sunrises and sunsets, researchers may finally have a better picture of where Atlantic puffins spend most of their lives.The brightly billed birds are often studied in their summer breeding season, but where they go for the rest of the year has been a mystery.It now appears that many Bay of Fundy puffins don’t venture all that far.“The non-breeding season is two-thirds or three-quarters of the life of a puffin and we had no idea what went on in those years,” said Tony Diamond, an ornithologist at the University of New Brunswick, and one of the authors of a research paper exploring the issue.“Until the technology came along that we could track them.”Tony Diamond, an ornithologist researcher with the University of New Brunswick, releases a puffin as part of his study on Machias Seal Island in the Bay of Fundy. (Anthony Einfeldt)That technology came in the form of tiny light sensors that were banded to the legs of 270 puffins from 25 different populations across the North Atlantic. The study included puffins from Canada, Norway, Ireland, Iceland, the United Kingdom and the U.S.Every couple of minutes, the sensors record the amount of daylight the puffins experience. Once the data is collected, the scientists are able to use it to map out where each bird has been in the world, based on the length of the day.Closer to homeIt turns out that puffins in the Bay of Fundy travel shorter distances during the winter months compared to their European counterparts. It’s a habit that appears to serve them well.“They go to a couple of surprising places,” Diamond said. “One is they go to the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.”Less energy put into travelling translates to better breeding, according to Diamond. He said it appears the birds that travel the least have greater breeding success in comparison to the larger European puffin populations.Machias Seal Island is a vital breeding ground for Atlantic puffins on this side of the Atlantic. The birds have been studied on the small island for decades. ( Atlantic Laboratory for Avian Research/UNB)“Most of the birds spend most of their time in the Gulf of Maine,” Diamond said. “But then you get these excursions to other places. We have two birds that actually go up to southern Labrador immediately after breeding.”Some birds travelled over 1,700 kilometres away from their breeding grounds, while 152 only ventured a few hundred kilometres from their colony.The study is published in the online edition of the scientific journal Current Biology and includes researchers from both sides of the Atlantic.It turns out there are marked differences in migration among colonies.The results show some puffins from European populations have crossed the Atlantic, but most stay in the open ocean away from land.Protecting the puffinThe Atlantic puffin is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It could become endangered if ecological conditions do not improve.Researchers are hoping the information gathered from the migration study will be help determine where protected areas should be established to help declining populations rebound.The Atlantic puffin, pictured here on Machias Seal Island, is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. (Atlantic Laboratory for Avian Research/UNB)“We now have maps of the winter distribution of birds from throughout the breeding range of puffins,” said Diamond.“We can see the areas that they use, those from each colony, and we can see areas where they overlap. Those are kind of the hotspots of winter distribution for puffins.”Bermuda-bound?But as valuable as the information is for future of the iconic bird, the travel destinations of a few puffins remain baffling.“A lot of them will go out to the edge of the continental shelf and then keep going south,” said Diamond. “So, we’ve got a cluster of birds that in April, which is just before the breeding season, they’re spending time around the latitude of Bermuda, out in the open ocean.”“In water that is warmer, way, way warmer that they are in when they are breeding. So that was a big surprise.”Diamond said he had no answers as to why birds that thrive in cold-water temperatures would spend time so far outside their expected range.“I don’t know,” said Diamond. “And we need to confirm it.”Tags used on puffins don’t measure temperature, he said, but the slightly bigger tags used on razorbills do.“So our next batch of tagging is going to be with tags that record temperature to confirm that at that time they really are in water that warm.”",The secret travelling life of the Atlantic puffin  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"Yep, it’s beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! The air is laced with the glorious aroma of lemon-scented morcon baking in your kitchen. As in many delicious Christmases past, you’re dreaming of your favorite holiday treats from your cherished heirloom family recipes. Just like what chef Myrna Segismundo grew up with, Christmas after Christmas, in her hometown Lipa, Batangas.This morning at the Maya Kitchen in Makati, Myrna shares some of the Segismundos’ treasured Christmas recipes that bring back many heartwarming childhood memories.“Having worked in restaurants, corporate dining, I feel very lucky that to this day, my family continues to enjoy the family meals and traditional recipes we grew up with,” Myrna relates as she rolls up her sleeves and prepares to regale us with a home-cooked Filipino Christmas feast. “I’m lucky to be the youngest in a family of 12. Maybe when my daddy was singing the 12 Days of Christmas, he meant something else. My parents, both pure Batangueños, came from the pre-war generation when raising big families was very welcome. To this day, our food is very simple but I’d like to think it’s very flavorful. We come from a very rich land where a lot of dishes like the calderetas, the adobos, the bulalos, and fresh fish like the maliputo and tawilis, the sinaing na tulingan, make our food — although very simple — very unique to us and also very flavorful.”Being the youngest of 12 children, Myrna would often be left in the kitchen with her yaya, who eventually became the cook, and mayordoma. And having grown up in a family who ate well (“not necessarily expensive food,” she clarifies), Myrna started developing her taste buds “based on what was served to us at home.”And then there were the fiestas when all the kusineros from the farm would cook all day and there was an open house. “Without realizing it, I was imbibing all these traditions and my cooking, whether it’s international or Filipino, is based on the development of my taste buds,” says Myrna.Not formally schooled as most chefs are but a proud graduate of the Segismundo kitchen, Myrna declares, “My taste is based on all those flavor profiles and memories from childhood. I create food on the basis of what tastes good for me. A schooled chef would have a formula but a chef who didn’t go to culinary school would have his taste, his own personal touch. As they say in the teleseryes, may hugot!”Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:Myrna feels lucky she’s still able to cook her family’s traditional Christmas recipes, whereas the younger generations may encounter difficulties looking back at traditions and what they grew up eating. Luckily, during those Christmases when her mother was still alive, she was able to document step by step her mother Emilia’s prized beef morcon recipe.She relates, “Defying the proper principles of cooking, I decided I would follow exactly the way she did it, hoping I would be able to duplicate the taste. From the results, I might have accomplished 95 percent of my mom’s cooking. I leave the five percent to your imagination. And I hope by the time the sauce and morcon are heated up, my mother would have blessed it and said, ‘O, 100 percent!’ From my taste recollection, I’m proud to say I might have achieved it. But I’m sure she’ll say, ‘Ako pa rin!’”For The Maya Kitchen Culinary Elite Series, Myrna whips up, before our delighted eyes (and taste buds), her Christmas table menu: adobo paté with pepper jelly and toast points; salad of young ubod and pomelos with honeyed-patisdressing and kinilaw of shrimps; Beef Morcon a la Emilia (stuffed with sweet pickles, chorizo, pork fat, queso de bola, ham strips, boiled eggs, etc. and garnished with potatoes and olives); and Turrones de Manila with Vanilla Gelato Spazzacamino (spiked with a dash of whisky and dusted with coffee powder); pears and apples poached in red wine.Myrna tells us that these recipes are not really complicated and the flavors are familiar to us all. “Like, who doesn’t know how to cook adobo? Don’t you dare raise your hand! But I will not attempt to give you a traditional adobo — I will tweak that recipe and give you an adobo paté, which we created by virtue of the fact that sometimes, you have your lazy moments deciding what you would feed your family. There’s the French influence in your cooking, Mediterranean, Asian, and what have you. So, you decide to put together the principles of cookery, apply French cooking technique to a classic Filipino recipe called adobo, and we have what we call adobo paté, which you can replicate in your own kitchen, or you can make your own personal recipe to share with friends or members of your family.”Where to find the ingredients for your Christmas feast? Why don’t you scrounge around your pantry or fridge? You just might find all the ingredients you need! Myrna believes that the morcon was created by someone who saw all the leftover stuff in the kitchen and decided to put them all together.She stresses, “Every time I work with dishes, I always think of ingredients that are readily available, in my pantry or the market. Sometimes, I can’t stand that I fill up my shelves and refrigerators with half bottles of honey, half bottles of olive oil or mustard and you never know what to do with them, they start to get crusty on top, nanghihinayang kang itapon. Just think of all the basura in your pantry, concoct something with what you have there, and you will be surprised to discover you have invented something. Start with 40-percent formula and 60-percent imagination. Believe me, this is how I created my ubod and pomelo salad with honey-patis dressing. I decided to add a kinilaw because kinilaw is a very memorable dish for me because it was our first attempt to promote Philippine cuisine abroad, in Madrid Fusion, when we were invited for the very first time to present a dish that would introduce our cuisine to the world.”Si, the chefs attending Madrid Fusion were very interested in our ingredients, they marveled at our calamansi, our patis, and our suka — sukang may sili, paombong, pinakurat, sinamak! Spanish chef Elena Arzak of the Michelin-star restaurant Arzak thinks we have the best vinegars in the world, beating even the balsamic vinegar.To cap Myrna’s Christmas table menu is the turon. “When the turon is served vs. the cakes, the No. 1 dessert is always the turon. I tried to teach this to the cooks everywhere I go, but nobody can do it. So I think I’m blessed and I will go down in culinary history as the turon maker, although it’s really very easy.”Whatever you’re serving this Christmas, be it ever so humble, do it with lots of love for some of the happiest memories are those shared by members of the family at the dining table.* * *For more information on Chef Myrna at The Maya Kitchen Culinary Elite Series and other course offerings, log on to www.themayakitchen.com, email contactus@themayakitchen.com, or visit The Maya Kitchen Culinary Center Tuesday to Saturday at 8F Liberty Building, 835 A.

"President Rodrigo Duterte did not hide his admiration over the 7.62mm sniper rifles donated by China to help his government win the war in Marawi City.“Yung mga sniper na dumating, ang gaganda. And I told (Defense Secretary Delfin) Lorenzana na paghatian ninyo na lalo na ‘yung sniper. Very beautiful. You’ll get it in a matter of days,” said Duterte in a speech in Davao City Thursday. Duterte is expecting anohter batch of sniper rifles from China in September.Duterte ordered Special Assistant to the President Bong Go to rush the ballistic examinations of the sniper rifles because couldn’t wait to deploy these as soon as possible to his men on the field in Marawi.“I hope that you can assemble about one battalion of snipers para — mahusay kung marami tayong snipers. They are also sniping at us and they have the beautiful guns, they have the Barretts,” said Duterte referring to the US Military issued Barret M107semi-automatic sniper rifle used by Maute snipers in Marawi City.“Well, it’s a deadly firearm, it can reach you almost one kilometer away. But may panlaban naman tayo. Marami man rin tayong Barrett. And with additional arms, I think we will find it easy really to operate,” said Duterte.After the Marawi war, Duterte is planning to investigate how these Barrettes issued by the Department of National Defense found their way into the hands of the enemy. He said one of the reasons why the Marawi war has lasted this long was because of the well-positioned snipers of Maute.“Taas kasi sila eh. So tayo, uphill. Nakaposisyon na ‘yung snipers nila, ‘yung mga Barrett. So practically we ha — we were in open country. So, every building was occupied with one or two… So, naparami ‘yung casualties natin,” said Duterte.",Pres. Duterte cant hide his admiration over Chinese sniper rifles: Ang Gaganda
"Three days before the Barangay Elections, the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition (TDC) made a final appeal to the Comelec for their demands that include higher compensation package, assurance of security and legal protection for the teachers who will sit as Board of Election Tellers (BET) on Monday’s village election. The group expressed dismay because according to them, the Comelec seems to ignore their request for a meeting they have submitted as early as mid-August.“Teachers will work for almost 24 hours or even more, from the time of distribution of election materials in the respective Comelec centers at early dawn of Monday up to the completion of all the tasks that usually up until the morning of the next day.” Benjo Basas, the group’s national chairperson said. “Yet teachers are only paid half the amount of the honorarium in the last automated elections held in May.” He continued.Basas said that manual elections like the one in Monday would expose the teachers in more possible errors, physical and mental fatigue, health risks, legal trouble and threats of harassment and physical attck. Thus, according to him, teachers deserve more than the total of P2, 500.00. The TDC proposes a payment of at least P4, 000.00, the total amount Comelec paid the teachers who sit as members of BEI last May.”Basas also noted that the Comelec still failed to review and implement its legal mandate that prohibits the appointment of teachers who are not registered voters in the city or municipality as members of the BET.“Both the election code and the subsequent Comelec Resolutions including the one for this October 28 Barangay polls prohibit the non-registered voters of the locality to sit as members of election tellers, yet the Comelec, in many instances allowed this to happen. Our teachers who are actually compelled to do this duty may face a possible election offense.” Basas explained.Last week, teachers of Manila raised this issue and ask a Comelec representative during the training in Araullo High School, the Comelec personnel agreed that indeed there may be a violation but told them to address the concern to the Comelec national office.Aside from these two issues of compensation and legal protection, the group also appeal to the Comelec and the national government to ensure that teachers will be protected against physical harm. Basas noted that Barangay elections, most of the time, are most intense and tensionable due mainly to the clannish nature of Philippine villages and the opposing candidates and their supporters are coming from the same grassroots localities, some are actually blood relatives.“We call on the Comelec to ensure the visibility of law enforcement authorities in areas they declared as election hot spots, from the start of the teachers work until they have finished all the tasks including the transportation of election paraphernalia from Comelec centers to polling places and vise versa.” Basas said.Basas believe that the presence of law enforcers may deter those who are planning to disrupt the process thru violence, tension and disorder on election day.“The problem with the bad politics and ailing electoral system is, everything may be blamed to the teachers, the front liners in elections, as if we have a direct stake in it.” Basas lamented. “We are the hapless victims of pre-election harassment, we cannot just leave the polling precincts whenever violence erupts on election day and after the polls, we are also subjects of electoral protests filed by the losing candidates.”Basas added that most of the time, they face these difficulties alone for the DepEd has no readily available legal assistance and the Comelec serves as prosecutors in election-related cases.“We appeal to the candidates and the general public to please spare the teachers. We do this task because we consider this as our patriotic duty, aside from this is our mandated work as public school teachers. However, given the choice, many of us would be opted not to sit as BET and would not risk our profession, our safety, our limbs or even our lives.”The TDC is one of the most active organizations advocating the amendment to election laws to effect the relief of teachers from ‘hazardous non-teaching related assignments’ especially poll duties and make these optional.",Pinoy News Blogger
"The Israeli military on Sunday said it has destroyed a tunnel built by the Hamas militant group that stretched from the Gaza Strip several hundred metres into Israeli territory, declaring a breakthrough in its war against underground threats from the Palestinian enclave.Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesperson, told reporters that Israel had used a new set of “tools” developed since a 2014 war with Hamas in order to destroy the tunnel. He said forces had detected the tunnel months ago and continued to monitor construction efforts by Hamas militants before demolishing it.Israel has made neutralizing the tunnel threat a top priority since that war, when Hamas militants on several occasions made their way into Israel. Although they did not manage to reach civilian areas, the attacks caught Israel off guard and terrified the local population.Conricus said a new system involving combat units, military intelligence, logistics and research had been used to destroy the tunnel. The system was first used to detect a tunnel that was destroyed on Oct. 30, but other aspects of the system were used this time around, he said.“There seems to be a change, a paradigm here in how these terror tunnels will be able to threaten us in the future,” he said. “It is by no means behind us, but this will surely force the terrorist organizations to change techniques and to adapt.”Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, declined to comment.Tunnel spanned a kilometreConricus said the tunnel began in the central Gazan town of Khan Younis and stretched for over a kilometre across the border and into Israel. Although not complete, he said the tunnel was “very substantial,” equipped with electricity, communications equipment and a ventilation system. It was located about a kilometre from an Israeli community.Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the tunnels were an unacceptable threat and that Israel would invest “every resource” to stop them. “I hope that in the coming months the threat of tunnels on the residents surrounding Gaza will become a thing of the past,” he said.Palestinian protesters clashes with Israeli soldiers along the Israel-Gaza border on Saturday. That and similar protests were held after U.S. President Donald Trump’s said his country would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images)The army said the timing of the weekend operation was not connected to a flare-up of deadly violence that followed President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The decision has infuriated the Palestinians, who seek Israel-annexed east Jerusalem as their own capital.Over the weekend, Israeli airstrikes hit several militant sites in Gaza in response to rocket fire, killing two Hamas militants. On Friday, two protesters were shot dead in skirmishes with Israeli troops along Gaza’s border.Hamas’ military wing issued a statement earlier Sunday threatening Israel with a “heavy price.”“Our battle for Jerusalem is going on round the clock, above and under the ground,” the statement said.​",Israel says tunnel stretching across border from Gaza destroyed  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

Both officers mockingly responded with “ang dami niyong alam!” and “marami kayong alam noh?”Afterwards, the police officer with the stick was seen taking out a pair of handcuffs as he approached one of the young men.

"Senator Antonio Trillanes IV has received heavy criticism and bashing after being stood up by Stephen Sackur in BBC Hard Talk interview.With a moral and political reputation at stake, it seemed only Rappler was trying to salvage Trillanes walk of shame by posting an article spun to favor Trillanes.Rappler ran the headline “Trillanes to BBC anchor: Filipinos will soon realize ‘damage’ caused by Duterte” which focused on the controversial Hard Talk interview.Despite Trillanes’ obviously besmirched reputation after the BBC interview, Rappler still tried to angle its news report in a way that positively highlighted Trillanes’ viewpoint.Netizens took to social media to express their dismay at Trillanes’ interview with one of them posting:How long does it take to expose a lying braggart?BBC – less than an hourPhilippines media – cannot answer. Mouth stuffed with money.Rappler was also targeted by the ire of netizens for allegedly protecting the senator.One netizen said, “ladies and gentlemen, mga kababayan, this is what spinning to condition the minds of the people is all about. The entire world has seen the meltdown of the Senator yet Rappler sees it differently. This online new entity has taken the role of fault-finder in the Duterte presidency to the point of neglecting critical thinking, which is a very important aspect of Thought Leadership. I am amused.”As Rappler’s founder, Maria Ressa was bashed for her editorial choices that have led to Rappler seemingly trying to protect a staunch Duterte critic.Netizen Mike Acebedo Lopez posted Rappler’s article on Trillens’ BBC interview and wrote a caption saying, “most of us have seen the BBC interview, a grand display of feeblemindedness and a much-deserved paring down of the senate stooge, yet this is Maria’s Rappler’s takeaway.

This started rumors about their breakup.Initially, Erich did not publicly comment on the rumors regarding her relationship with Daniel. Because of the actress' reluctance to talk about the matter, fans were hoping that it was all just a small misunderstanding.Fans got their hopes up that maybe the two could still work it out when Daniel reportedly said that they were ""ok"" in a comment on Instagram a couple of days before the sad truth finally came out.Some popular sources for showbiz news on the internet have speculated that the breakup was caused by a third party, supposedly a girl. However, the third party theory was replaced by a more shocking one shortly after.Now, sources say the real reason behind the breakup was because of a misunderstanding between the two about money.

"Here we are.For the film industry, 2017 represented an important turning point, for Hollywood and the culture at large.Although they’ve been gestating for years, filmmakers somehow managed to serve up movies that spoke to the moment. Some are micro works of wonder, others are vast, awe-inducing spectacles.After another year of sitting in the dark, here are the stories that shone brightest.1) The Florida ProjectLeave it to the director of Tangerine to find wonder in the lives of these Disney World economic refugees. Set among the collateral damage of the American Dream, young Moonee and friends show us how to make any place your magic kingdom.2) I, TonyaYou think you know disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding? You have no idea. I, Tonya is a witty, self-aware ride through America’s celebrity grinder with a revelation of a performance by Margot Robbie.3) Call Me By Your NameArmie Hammer stars as the aloof American who comes to stay at the Italian villa and makes an impression on young Timothee Chalamet. A sensual story about discovering your own truth, told with sensitivity and a wisp of sadness.4) The Shape of WaterOnly director Guillermo Del Toro could look at The Creature from the Black Lagoon and think to himself, “What if that were a love story?” A Cold War romance like you’ve never seen, with an effervescent Sally Hawkins, who already wowed us this year with Maudie.5) Blade Runner 2049Leave it to Montreal’s Denis Villeneuve to pull off the impossible, doing justice to Ridley Scott’s sci-fi classic while pushing the story forward with this neon-tinged investigation into the lines between real and artificial. (Read the full review.)6) Three Billboards Outside Ebbing MissouriFrances McDormand goes all in for this blackest of black comedies about a mother raging against the unsolved murder of her daughter. Note to Hollywood, give us more like this please: twisting tales that take you places you never expected to go.7) The BreadwinnerFrom the books of Canadian Deborah Ellis comes this Canadian-Irish co-production that shows us the true cost of war through the eyes of a family in Kabul living under the Taliban regime. Young Parvana’s courage unearths treasures of Afghan culture in the rubble.8) DunkirkOh, the exquisite tension of this tick-tock of a war film from Christopher Nolan. The Dark Knight director scrambles the time scales but keeps the focus squarely on the survivor’s humanity. (Read the full review.)9) Darkest HourDunkirk, part two. Set in British parliament during the famous military manoeuvre, this ode to oratory starring Gary Oldman features Winston Churchill rallying the country with weaponized rhetoric.10) Spider-Man: HomecomingI almost gave this slot to Wonder Woman, but if I’m honest, Spider-Man was responsible for some of the most fun I had in the movie theatre all year. Beyond the John Hughesian influences, the moment when Michael Keaton opened the door? The. Best. (Read the full review.)11) ColumbusA sick father strands John Cho in a place known for its modernist architecture. There, he meets a young woman (Haley Lu Richardson) who is a guide of sorts, but lacks direction. A quiet gem of a film about the spaces inside us and the ones we inhabit.12) Get OutWatch Get Out again to see how carefully director Jordan Peele assembled this horror-comedy about racism that’s as disturbing as it is relevant.13) Lady BirdGreta Gerwig wrote and directed this film about a young woman dying to leave her hometown. You don’t see Greta on screen but you feel her in the deftly told story about defining yourself at a difficult age.14) Lady MacBethA few years from now, Florence Pugh will be in everything and Lady MacBeth is the reason why. It’s a story about a woman who is not to be trifled with.15) Personal ShopperBella is dead. Long live Kristen Stewart. When you weren’t looking, the former Twilight star became one of the most exciting actors of her generation. For proof, look no further than this ghost story for the texting generation. (Hear the audio review.)16)Brigsby BearJames (SNL‘s Kyle Mooney) has been lied to and manipulated his entire life. His only connection to the outside world was a strange children’s show called Brigsby Bear. Now that he’s free, James has only one wish: finish telling Brigsby’s story. There is an undeniable sweetness to this film about fandom and what we invest in the stories we love. It’s Mark Hamill’s second-best performance of the year.17) Window HorsesThe National Film Board does it again with this animated journey of self-discovery from Ann Marie Fleming. A Chinese-Canadian poet travels to Iran. The simple cartoon style belies a surprisingly intricate tale about family, immigration and valuing your voice.18) The Disaster ArtistIt’s a love song for losers, and perhaps the most honest film about Hollywood ever made. By retelling the story of The Room, James “I’m So Meta” Franco has made his masterpiece.19)The Big SickA modern love story for our irrational times that happens to be hilarious, The Big Sick features charming performances by both Zoe Kazan and Kumail Nanjiani, but the grandparents on both sides of the cultural divide steal the show.20) Baby DriverI had some issues with the ending the first time I watched this heist hybrid from director Edgar Wright. But on second viewing I was floored by how immaculately Wright knits together every moment. Don’t let the presence of Kevin Spacey stop you from enjoying this pedal-to-metal musical.","From Get Out to Spider-Man, Lady Bird to Blade Runner: Eli Glasners best films of 2017  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017"
"Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano said that the series of New People’s Army attack nationwide is part of President Rody Duterte’s plan to push a revolutionary government.He said that Duterte’s bloody approach to counter the NPA rebels will just justify the need for RevGov.“Communist groups have long been waging acts to bring down the democratic government regardless of who the sitting president is, yet President Duterte immediately and comfortably appointed communist allies in the Cabinet and other high-ranking government posts,” he said.“The repeated threats of declaring a revolutionary government by the President, his continuing relationship with the CPP-NPA-NDFP, and the disjointed and disparate policy against communist rebels are something to be wary about,” he added.The congressman also believed that there will be a peace negotiation to be drafted this December which means Duterte continuously in a relationship with the rebels.“In fact, as a result of these backdoor negotiations, a proposed simultaneous signing of agreements this December between the peace-negotiating panels is being prepared,” Alejano said.“Alejano said: “It is puzzling that while President Duterte is lambasting the CPP-NPA in public, backdoor negotiations with the NDFP continue.”“The people and other government institutions, particularly the military, should remain vigilant and critical [of] such machinations meant to violate the Constitution and destroy our democratic government,” he said.Now, would you believe this solon who has been acting as shadow clone of Senator Trillanes? Duterte’s message was clear. He wanted to have peace with the rebels but the NPA seemed unapologetic and hard-headed. They continue to attack even the President Security Group vehicles while the peace talk in Netherlands was on-going. It was a clear manifestation that the rebels don’t want to end war with the government.What can you say about this? Leave your message below!",Alejano: NPA attack part of Dutertes plan for RevGov

"Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) Chief Atty. Persida Acosta announced to the press that the suspect in the Bulacan Massacre will not get any help from their office. Atty. Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victim’s family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acosta’s statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12:“… to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.”No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accused’s guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:“(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.”The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Estrella and Aurora were found lifeless and naked in different parts of the house. The three children were then found inside a locked room also dead from stab wounds. They were found by Carlos, Estrella’s husband who just came home from his night duty as a security guard in a bank in Makati City.One of the three suspects surrendered himself to the authorities as his conscience was haunting him and he regretted the crime that he did.

"So what was so special about her Golden Chocolate Ball that qualified Michelle Lukman for Lifetime Channel’s MasterChef Australia Season 9, set to air on Monday night, June 19, starting at 8 o’clock?Stay tuned as Michelle reveals the back story in an exclusive phone interview with Funfare.Born and raised in Bandung, Indonesia, until her family migrated to Melbourne when she was 11, Michelle, turning 20 on Sept. 23, is the youngest among the 24 aspirants for the MasterChef title. The winning competitive cooking show premiered in April 2009. Michelle said that she learned the art from watching her mother and grandmother cook traditional Indonesian food at home.You are the youngest among the contestants. How do you feel about it? Weren’t you intimidated?“Uhm, I think being the youngest is challenging but it’s exciting at the same time because I think it’s going to be interesting to see how the audience will react to our different styles of cooking. So, my specialty is desserts but I can cook savory, too, but it will be interesting to see what other people are able to cook.”Of course, you already have a wealth of experience. But for this particular event, did you have any special preparations?Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1“I think…yes, practice, practice and practice to make everything perfect. I think before entering the competition, it’s so important to kind of practice the basics. I’m just trying to learn different things just to prepare myself as much as I could.”You impressed the judges with your Golden Chocolate Ball, right?“Yes, so I made this gold…yeah, the Golden Ball.”Just between us, how did you invent it?“I was inspired by my childhood. My grandma used to have this Christmas Tree. My sister and I used to sit around with the ornaments. One of them fell to the ground and it was shiny and beautiful, so I was inspired by making my own twist to it which was using luster dust, and chocolate. When you crack it open, it’s kind of the replication of how my sister and I broke her ornament.”Yes, and I understand you didn’t have any formal education in culinary arts but you learned a lot from your mom and from your grandma. What else have you learned from them as far as cooking is concerned?“I’ve learned a lot of things from my grandma. Whenever she cooked in the kitchen, I used to just watch her taste everything. So, yes, seasoning everything like Indonesian dishes. She’s more savory. So, I’ve learned a lot from her.”Were you the taster?“Yeah, I loved tasting her dish. Usually I would be next to her. She would taste the dish and she’d go, ‘Oh, hey, Michelle. Have some of this and tell me how it tastes, what seasoning it needs’.”Indonesian food is usually spicy, hot. Have you loved hot and spicy food since you were a kid?“I can handle spicy food but not super spicy. My grandma can handle it well. But I think if I were to consume too much chili, I would burn up.”What’s your favorite recipe?“My favorite recipe from my grandma, you mean? I really like her curry. Yeah, it’s like Indonesian curry. It’s a bit thinner than most curries but it’s very nice. I really like her rendang as well. It has to be cooked very well.”When you prepare a party or dinner for your friends, what usually goes into the menu? What kind of food do you cook for them?“Usually I would use western food. I would put an Asian twist to it. Asian infused. And desserts. I make a lot of desserts.”Michelle with some of the 23 other MasterChef finalists: I learned a lot about cooking from my mom and my grandma by watching them in the kitchen. They made me their taster.Filipino food and Indonesian food taste almost the same. Have you tried cooking Filipino food? We also have spicy food.“I have a few Filipino friends, which is nice. The food is quite similar with seasonings and flavoring and spices. I really like many kinds of food but I think to stick to my traditional route is very interesting to me.”Have you tasted any Filipino food and how did you find it?“I think I’ve tasted a few when I went out with my friends to a restaurant. I can’t remember. It was a long time ago. Yeah, I really like it. I can see some of the ingredients used are quite similar to what my grandma used at home. It’s just different variations but still has that traditional flavor to it.”How many siblings do you have? Are you the only one into cooking?“I have one younger sister. She’s not into cooking, but she’s into other things. But she cooked something once and she burnt it. I think that’s it. She doesn’t cook anymore.”Could you tell me more about your family? What kind of family you come from? Must be a family who loves food, obviously. What kind of childhood did you have in Australia?“Growing up in Australia, I’ve tasted different kinds of food. I obviously started just eating a lot of Indonesian food when I was back in Indonesia. But as I moved to Australia everything changed so I started experimenting with different kinds of food — with western food. We didn’t eat a lot of pizza in Indonesia; it’s just something we have once a month. But since I came to Australia, I started learning that there were different variations of food, not just Indonesian food. But I still make sure that I stick to my grandma’s food at the same time.”You’re 19 and you must be in college, I understand. What are you taking up?“Yeah, I’m still 19. I was studying Nutrition. I find it very interesting. I love cooking but I also love the nutrition side of it. Understanding what kind of food needs to be recommended for people, especially those who have diabetes and specific illness. I think it’s nice to help people with that as well.”Are you gonna put up a restaurant after graduation?“I would love to open up my own dessert bar one day. So, with a bit of Indonesian twist to it. I’m gonna slowly work on that.”You’re called a dessert queen. Would the restaurant that you’re planning be specializing in sweets?“Yes, it’s gonna be sweets.

"Rumors of military coup against President Rodrigo Duterte has started circulating on social media text massages.According to report, text message circulating said the “Magdalo group led by Trillanes and Alejano has started preparing a coup.”However, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV denied rumors that he and the Magdalo group are behind a supposed coup plot against Duterte.In a statement, Trillanes said there was “absolutely no truth” to the rumors.“I maintain my position that there is no need to oust President Duterte because he is already self-destructing,” he said.“This is the handiwork of Dutertard trolls who have nothing else to do but to divert the attention of the public from the gross incompetence and shortcomings of the Duterte administration,” Trillanes, a staunch critic of Duterte, added.Trillanes was known for leading the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny when he and some 300 junior officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines took over the Oakwood towers in Makati City as protest for alleged rampant corruption in the Philippines.Trillanes was detained for almost seven and a half years after protesting against corruption.",RUMORS OF MAGDALO COUP AGAINST DUTERTE CIRCULATING ON TEXT MESSAGES

"1855 SHARES Share TweetZiona (often misnamed in the non-native media as Ziona Chana; born 20 July 1945) is the leader of Chana páwl, a Christian sect formed in June 1942, which survives in the mountains of Mizoram state of India, sharing borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar.He is known for holding a world record as the head of the “world’s largest existing family” with 39 wives, 94 children, 14 daughters-in-law and 33 grandchildren, 180 in total and counting.The family is now living in Baktawng village, Mizoram.Ziona was featured in Ripley’s Believe It or Not! top 11 strangest stories for the year 2011, and in 2013’s Ripley Believe It or Not book 9. He is proud of and fortunate to be head of such a large family.Ziona is chief of the Christian sect known as “Chana Pawl”, which was established by his father. The sect practices polygamy. Chana sect followers claim that its origin is traced to the Bible’s Revelation Chapter 20 to “Kum Sang Rorel” or the rule of 1,000 years by Jesus Christ on Earth.The sect was originally named Khuangtuaha Pawl, after the founder Khuangtuaha. He founded it on 12 June 1942, when its disciples were removed from Hmawngkawn village by the headman of the village for propagating a theology considered “wrong and dangerous”. The sect celebrates its founding day as “Bawkte Kut” or the festival of the hut on June 12 every year. Members of the Chana sect number about 2,000 who reside in the Baktawng Tlangnuam village.Family lifeZiona hails from the village of Baktawng in central Serchhip district, which is 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the south of Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. He was born on 20 July 1945. He was married at the age of 17 to Zathiangi, his first wife, who was older than him by three years. She now controls the household activities of the family with strict discipline and is proud that everyone in the family respects her role. Ten of his wives he married in the span of one year.Ziona has built a four-storied mansion, a concrete structure, which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family. The house is called the “Chhuan That Run” or the House of the New Generation and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng. There is also a ‘khualbuk’ or a guesthouse to accommodate visitors coming to the village.Ziona has a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives take turns to sleep with him according to a roster.His younger wives stay close to his room on the same floor and there are always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them.All his wives claim to love him. His 39th wife is Madam Siamthangi who is proud to be Ziona’s wife even though he is much older than her. She is 30 years old (as of 2012) and has a five-year-old daughter by him. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they get a week to spend with him.He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He says that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembers the names of every member of his family.Ziona’s family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He does not seek any assistance from the government.Ziona’s wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture (jhum cultivation), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth.Daily family life in his house begins at 5.50 AM when all family members assemble for prayers and thereafter daily duties are assigned. Prayers and meals are held in a large hall in the mansion. Dinner is served from 4 to 6 PM in the order of age, and the day comes to a close with everyone retiring for the night by 9PM when the lights are switched off.An enormous amount of food is prepared to feed the family: 220 pounds (100 kg) of rice, 132 pounds (60 kg) of potatoes and 39 chickens.Ziona’s 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests.Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, while recording Ziona’s family as the largest living family in the world, observed: “It’s a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching 19 Kids and Counting or Sister Wives. The 66-year-old Indian man has 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren.”Ziona is interested in having more wives, even from the United States.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziona",Worlds Largest Family With 39 Wives And 94 Children

"On Tuesday, June 27 , 2017, 5 people were found dead inside their house at North Ridge Royal Subdivision in Bulacan . The heinous crime was dubbed the Bulacan Massacre . The person who found them was Dexter Carlos Sr ., a security guard working at a bank in Makati and one of the victim’s husband. According to Dexter, he arrived home at around 8:45 am from his nightshift job but was surprised when no one opened the gate for him. He then climbed the gate only to see his mother-in-law, wife, and children massacred in their home.On June 28 , one of the suspects of the Bulacan massacre, 26-year-old Carmelo Ibanez , was arrested. Following his apprehension, he confessed to committing the heinous crime.Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr. , Bulacan police director, asked him why he did such a thing. Ibañez, a construction worker, said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN:“Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok.”Of the 5 victims of the Bulacan massacre, 2 women were r*ped by Ibañez and his two other companions, Tony and Inggo .According to Ibañez, the three suspects collectively did P150 worth of shabu during their drinking session before they decided to go to the Carlos residence to murder the people living there. When asked why they also killed the children, he simply said he didn’t know that there were any. He said:“Hindi po namin alam na may bata doon, ano na po kasi sa droga… Iyung mga bata, nakaka-meet ko rin po iyun. Minsan po kasi, nanood iyun sa kabila, sa ano ng ate ko, bahay.”He then asked the family to forgive him for what he had done. Ibañez said:“Ako po ang pumatay sa kanilang lahat. Nagsisi po ako sa ginawa ko po. Sana po ay mapatawad po ako kasi po lulong po ako sa droga saka po sa alak po. Pasensya na po kayo.”Watch ABS-CBN’s full interview with the suspect below:",Trip-Trip Lang: Bulacan Massacre Suspect Confesses to Killing All 5 Victims!
"Dapat nga magpasalamat ang taong-bayan kay Ferdinand Edralin Marcos dahil ang Philippine peso/money is backed up by the Marcos gold which Ferdinand Marcos owns even before he became a Congressman. Truth will set us all free. This information is being shared to you all so that we may all Co-Create a beautiful future here on Earth.History is written by the Victors it is said. EVEN IF IT IS A LIE. But need not worry because as Buddha has said, ""Three things cannot be long hidden, the Sun, the Moon and the TRUTH"". And 30 years on after the victors of the Edsa coup'd'etat and power grab has written their narrative and lies about Ferdinand Edralin Marcos and Imelda Romualdez Marcos - truth is NOW UNRAVELING and it is unraveling so fast the LIERS are being suffocated with their own lies and TRUTH SEEKERS are being called revisionist. Marcos never was a Dictator as has been feed to the masses. How can a dictator do it alone? It is like playing 'PATINTERO' (Traditional Game in the Philippines) by yourself, IN IT?Pati ang mga taong pinatay ng mga komunista during the Martial Law years ay ibinintang kay Marcos. Marcos has no hands in the killing spree of the communist group in the Philippines. We better learn our lesson well or else we will suffer the same faith as that of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam with their killings fields. That killing fields happened in the Philippines in the hands of the communist but was pin pointed at Marcos and Ferdinand got the blame for protecting the Filipinos who only want to live in Peace under a climate of Democracy.Pati ang mga taong pinatay ng mga komunista during the Martial Law years ay ibinintang kay Marcos.

That killing fields happened in the Philippines in the hands of the communist but was pin pointed at Marcos and Ferdinand got the blame for protecting the Filipinos who only want to live in Peace under a climate of Democracy.Truth is now out that the reason for most anger and hate of Filipinos against the Marcoses are due to the 16 International Public Relations firms hired to destroy the Marcoses. Click here for the evidence.And here is one narrative that pinpoints the main players in the game to remove the legitimate President of the Philippines in 1986 - Ferdinand Edralin Marcos. And all of this is because of the gold, the riches of our land and our natural resources too. Read HERE for the Economic Hitmen that really destroyed our nation and our sovereignty. Sabi nga ni Erap, ""Walang tutulong sa Pilipino kundi kapwa Pilipino din"" and that Pilipino was Marcos.Now, do not accuse people who look at documentation and historical account as revisionist because their is nothing to revise in TRUTHFULNESS.Now, do not accuse people who look at documentation and historical account as revisionist because their is nothing to revise in TRUTHFULNESS.Now tell me who is a real Dictator by their action and corroborated with documentary evidence. Marcos may have been an Authoritatian from the time he declared Martial Law until January 17, 1981 when it was lifted but Marcos was never a dictator and that is supported with documentations and historical account too.Now tell me who is a real Dictator by their action and corroborated with documentary evidence. Marcos may have been an Authoritatian from the time he declared Martial Law until January 17, 1981 when it was lifted but Marcos was never a dictator and that is supported with documentations and historical account too.Now back to Action Speaks louder than words. Marcos is not a Dictator for he never appointed anyone to a job that is meant to be only elected by the people. If there is a Dictator in the Philippines, By Their Action Yee Shall Be Known - that is Cory Aquino. Why? Because, when the power grab became successful and Cory ordered the Kidnapping of President Marcos (Click here for evidence) - she then removed from their elective office ALL those who were elected by the people to serve them and replaced them with OIC - Officers In Charge. This is a fact that no one can deny.Truth may be slow in coming out but once it is out, no amount of army can stop it and that is precisely what is happening now with the truth about the Marcoses and how we as Filipinos were duped into participating in a revolution hell bent on destroying our nation and stealing our gold and natural resources and NOW dumb - ing down our society through the introduction of the K 12 Education program. Look at what is happening in the USA, that is what will happen to the Philippines if we are not to stop this madness. You want evidence? Read The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, Revised and Abridged EditionShall we then put things in perspective EH? Truth of the matter is that history only looked at documentary evidence NOT on the emotional narrative of Victors in an event that would lie to all till eternity. Truth of the matter is that Marcos was the real winner of the 1986 elections.Shall we then put things in perspective EH? Truth of the matter is that history only looked at documentary evidence NOT on the emotional narrative of Victors in an event that would lie to all till eternity. Truth of the matter is that Marcos was the real winner of the 1986 elections.How can we call Marcos a Dictator when he has all these elections during his term. Fifteen (15) elections in twenty (20) years in power. It is like almost having an election every year - kinulang lang ng five more elections and it is every year na. Under a Dictatorship, no election is ever allowed. Under a Dictatorship, NO elective officials are allowed ONLY appointed officials. Action speaks louder than words and that is always the case in judging a man of his good and bad deeds. If we want to label Ferdinand Marcos then we should call him ""A Great Democrat"" and not a Dictator because all his actions points to that evidence.Truth is self evident in itself. No matter how one tries to suppress it and hide it, it will find a way of making known.. Imelda and Ferdinand are truly the heroes of the Philippines and of the world and please do not believe what I write here - I want you to go on and research it yourself as I have done for more than 30 years now and hence my conviction is from that effort and energy of all those years. Funny how things really is and how intuition works very well for me because in the pick of my research about Imelda and Ferdinand - most of the material available for me in 1986 and beyond were mostly Anti-Imelda and Anti-Ferdinand materials but they seem not to jibe with my INNER KNOWING.Indeed, as Arthur Schopenhauer once said that ""All truth passes through three stages, First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently oppossed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident"". The Filipino people have been through all these three stages in the last 30 years and we are now in the last stage of accepting the truth about what Imelda has been saying all along and it is all self-evident.The evidence are all clear and HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED by the mainstream media for far too long now. But truth really will come out and can never be suppressed at all. As Buddha has said that "" Three things cannot be long hidden, the Sun, the Moon and the Truth"" Here are below the truth that THE MEDIA DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT.That the Human rights violations of the Marcos Era were mostly fabricated to bring down the regime. Here are documentary evidence on the link. Please click here.JUSTICE FOR IMELDA NOW...Three things cannot be long hidden, the Sun, the Moon and the Truth said Buddha. And when you buried a truth, it sprouts again after it has shown the LIGHT.As one Loyalist puts it on a facebook page. ""Listing of the Public Relations Firms hired by Ms. Cory Aquino to destroy the reputation of President Marcos, which documents reveals that the funds used to financed the media groups against Marcos were mainly from government funds. Ganito kalaki ang ginastos ni Cory para lang sirain si FEM, pera ng sambayanan pa ang ginamit.

""I do not need to do anything because I believe in DIVINE JUSTICE"".And here is the most important interview of Imelda Romualdez Marcos during her kidnapping in Hawaii that the mainstream media does not want us all to know about.Tapos na ang 1986 at wala pa rin silang napapatunayan. Si Ninoy Aquino di man lang nila mabigyan ing hustisya. Asawa ni Ninoy naging presidente pero ang asawa nito di man lang nabigyan ng hustisya and kanyang sariling asawa. Bakit kaya? Dahil kaya alam na alam nila kung sino talaga ang utak ng pagpatay kay Ninoy? . Anak ni Ninoy presidente since 2010 at matatapos na ang termino nitong 2016 pero di pa rin nabigyan ng hustisya ang tatay nya. BAKIT KAYA?

She has to make the ultimate sacrifice of giving up her ambition and her dream for her people just so to avoid blood shed. Her husband Ferdinand has to decide similar decision in 1986 when he gave up power to avoid blood shed too. And earlier in 1972, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos has to sacrifice his honor to prevent millions from being slaughtered by the communist surge in the Philippines by declaring MArtial Law. Just three years after that and upon ignoring the writing on the wall and Ferdinand's advice to his counterparts in SouthEast Asia - just three years later in 1975. Nations such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia fell into full blown communism and we now have those famous killing fields which were made into movies. Go figure.Watch this video and get an idea how communist destroys nations and families. They killed all thinking individuals such as teachers, engineers, doctors, and all educated people. How it turns children into killing machines. Pasalamat nga ang mga Pinoy at nagkaroon ng Martial Law sa atin.

"President Rodrigo Duterte did not hide his admiration over the 7.62mm sniper rifles donated by China to help his government win the war in Marawi City.“Yung mga sniper na dumating, ang gaganda. And I told (Defense Secretary Delfin) Lorenzana na paghatian ninyo na lalo na ‘yung sniper. Very beautiful. You’ll get it in a matter of days,” said Duterte in a speech in Davao City Thursday. Duterte is expecting anohter batch of sniper rifles from China in September.Duterte ordered Special Assistant to the President Bong Go to rush the ballistic examinations of the sniper rifles because couldn’t wait to deploy these as soon as possible to his men on the field in Marawi.“I hope that you can assemble about one battalion of snipers para — mahusay kung marami tayong snipers. They are also sniping at us and they have the beautiful guns, they have the Barretts,” said Duterte referring to the US Military issued Barret M107semi-automatic sniper rifle used by Maute snipers in Marawi City.“Well, it’s a deadly firearm, it can reach you almost one kilometer away. But may panlaban naman tayo. Marami man rin tayong Barrett. And with additional arms, I think we will find it easy really to operate,” said Duterte.After the Marawi war, Duterte is planning to investigate how these Barrettes issued by the Department of National Defense found their way into the hands of the enemy. He said one of the reasons why the Marawi war has lasted this long was because of the well-positioned snipers of Maute.“Taas kasi sila eh. So tayo, uphill. Nakaposisyon na ‘yung snipers nila, ‘yung mga Barrett. So practically we ha — we were in open country. So, every building was occupied with one or two… So, naparami ‘yung casualties natin,” said Duterte.",Pres. Duterte cant hide his admiration over Chinese sniper rifles: Ang Gaganda
"Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue answers questions during a press conference introducing Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Ante Zizic at Cleveland Clinic Courts on Sept. 7, 2017, in Independence, Ohio. Jason Miller/Getty Images/AFPLeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers have dominated the NBA Eastern Conference since his return to “The Land” in 2014. But so far in seven games in the 2017-2018 NBA regular season, the perennial powerhouse has gotten off to an underwhelming start.After starting the season at a 3-1 win/loss mark, the Cavs dropped its last three games, punctuated by blowout losses to the New Orleans Pelicans and the New York Knicks.READ: Cousins’ triple-double powers Pelicans past CavsPrior to that, the team lost a close game against the Brooklyn Nets—another non-playoff team from last season.Speaking to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin shortly after the loss to the Knicks, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue made his displeasure known.“Tonight’s loss and the last couple are unacceptable, and the only way we’re going to be able to get out of it is to put the work in—as players, as coaches,” he said. “And we’re going to do that. … When you lose to teams the way we’ve been getting beat, it’s unacceptable.”Much like every team in the league, the Cavs are known to hit a wall at some point in the lengthy regular season. However, their apparent struggles seem to have come much earlier than usual.Lue also bemoaned the team’s poor transition defense, and attributed it to the lack of effort.“Teams just look faster than we do at every position,” Lue said. “They’re running fast, they’re spreading, they’re pushing the ball up the floor. It’s like we can’t keep up.”Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Cavs’ lineup is far from a hundred percent, with key addition Isaiah Thomas expected to be out until the All-Star break with a hip injury.The team also added several new faces to its roster, which still needs some more time to coexist on the floor.

"With the Philippine debut of the magical and mischievous musical Matilda fast approaching, the cast and crew have been working nonstop to bring the show to life onstage. The musical showcases an array of talented performers who are just as eager to share the show’s iconic story with the audience, one of whom is Jamie Wilson.Jamie is a stalwart of Philippine theater and has 37 years of experience as an actor to back him up. He has made the stage his home since the age of seven, appearing in numerous critically-acclaimed productions such as Pippin, Brighton Beach Memoirs, Almost Maine, Rock of Ages, Jersey Boys: The Story Of Frankie Valli: The Four Seasons,Run For Your Wife and Kinky Boots, just to name a few.Come November, he will be playing Miss Trunchbull, the terrifying headmistress of Crunchem Hall who gives the young students a lot of reasons to revolt. To get to know what it’s like to be part of the spellbinding production, we sat down with him for an interview.You’ve done so much in theater, inhabited so many roles. What do you love about it?“I started out in professional theater when I was seven years old, and have made the theater my home, not only as an actor but also immersing myself in the production and technical aspects. I have had the good fortune to work with some of best theater practitioners here, and will forever be grateful for the knowledge and wisdom I have learned and earned from them.“This is my 38th year in Philippine theater, and I am still very much the excited little child, amazed by the magic that each production has.”In Kinky Boots, you played an overly macho factory worker. Here you’re playing a woman! How did you get the role?“I auditioned for the part, just like everyone else!”What’s about Matilda the Musical that excites you in joining the cast?“I always welcome the opportunity to be directed by Bobby Garcia; his vision and his passion for storytelling are truly phenomenal, and I would fight for the chance to belong to any world he creates. I am so excited to see how the audiences respond to our story, and how the world will recognize the new talents they will be seeing on our stage.“I am also very excited to be playing the villain! It’s so much fun to be evil (laughs)!”Fans of Roald Dahl’s book know Miss Trunchbull well, but how did you approach her as a character and what do you enjoy most about the role?“Miss Trunchbull is such a unique and iconic character to play. She is explosive, vindictive, strict and uncompromising. And she is such a joy to portray. The best thing about playing Miss Trunchbull is that I get to be extremely mean to everyone, saying the harshest and most insulting things, and relishing every bit of evilness that pours out of her. It’s very liberating.”Aside from her being a woman and the villain, how is she different from the many other characters that you’ve played before?“Miss Trunchbull is such a well-written character, but her reasons for being the way she is aren’t given in the script, so the creation of a character like this demands a lot of research, trial and error, and laser-like focus. You cannot let your guard drop for one second, but when you get into her groove, it can be tremendously fun.”What is it like being with the cast and crew of the Atlantis theater company?“In every Atlantis production I’ve been, the cast and crew become a very tight family. It’s a funny dynamic in rehearsals because as Miss Trunchbull, the children have to be terrified of me, but as a fellow actor, they also need to trust me, so a delicate balance must be maintained.“I am just over the moon that I am closely working with Cris Villonco again; sharing the stage with this woman is just such a wonderful gift. It’s difficult this time around though because I have to be so mean and cruel to her!”How about a little teaser on what to expect this November?“After months of preparation and rehearsals from the amazingly talented cast and creative team, I think our long hours of hard work will culminate in a magical story that will remind us all of how, deep down in our hearts, we are still children. And that the child in all of us should still be encouraged to play, to laugh, to learn and to dream.”You can catch the talented Jamie as Miss Trunchbull in Matilda the Musical at the Meralco Theater, Ortigas Center, Pasig City from Nov. 10 to Dec. 10.

"PNP Director General Chief Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa lectured a police desk officer.The officer was not saluting properly to him.He checked the position of the officer from head to toe.PNP Director General Chief Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa once again lectured a police officer who was not saluting properly to him . Chief dela Rosa recently visited Mandaluyong Police Station to personally talk with the rookie cops who were involved in police brutality caught on camera.In a video posted by News5 , Chief dela Rosa was seen disappointed and irritated by the improper salute of the police desk officer upon entering the station. The officer received several sermons from the cranky PNP chief.“Ayusin mo yan,” Chief dela Rosa told the desk officer while he was correcting the position of his hand.He further inspected the officer if his feet are standing 45 degrees. Chief dela Rosa then headed inside the station along with his entourage. Netizens also praised the chief for disciplining him.The viral cops he was going to confront were Police Officers Tandog and Enriquez . However, he was left disappointed as the two cops were not there. They were the cops who were allegedly caught in a video beating a civilian inside inside San Jose Barangay Hall in Mandaluyong City.The video was uploaded on Wednesday and instantly received multiple criticism from social media users. PO1 Tandog and Enriquez quickly surrendered to the authorities after their video went viral.Earlier this week, Chief dela Rosa attended the recognition rites of police trainees of Police Regional Offices 6 and 18 in Bago City, Negros Occidental . During his speech, he challenged the 821 trainees.“I want to make sure that after taking your oath as police officers of the Philippine National Police, it doesn’t mean that you’re PO1 only of Bacolod or Iloilo City Police Offices, or Regions 6 or 18, but you are PO1 of the PNP, meaning you can be assigned anywhere in the Philippine archipelago,” Chief dela Rosa said.“It should be your mindset and [you should be] willing to offer [your] life in the service of the country. Ang pinaka ayaw ko sa pulis ay yong duwag,” he added.He stressed that as police officers, they should serve the people and enforce the law. He also added that they don’t become a cop to get rich or get involved into illegal organizations.",WATCH! PNP Chief Bato Dela Rosa Lectured This Police Officer After He Executed an Improper Salute
"General Motors of Canada is proposing to build a renewable energy project at its St. Catharines Propulsion Plant in Ontario, a first of its kind endeavour for the automaker which it estimates will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 77 per cent from the facility.The project proposes to build a 6.4 megawatt co-generation plant that will use renewable landfill gas as fuel to generate electricity and recover thermal energy to power and heat the St. Catharines plant, which manufactures V6 and V8 engines and GF6 transmissions.GM Canada says that in addition to significantly reducing net greenhouse gas emissions the proposed project will also lower energy electrical costs, improving the facility’s long-term competitiveness.The automaker says once the project is online in mid-2019, clean energy will power approximately 32 per cent of the St. Catharines plant — the most of any of GM’s global population operations worldwide.It says the project is a partnership with Alectra Utilities, Integrated Gas Recovery Services and the TargetGHG program funded by the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science.",GM to build renewable generator to turn landfill gas to energy  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"Although U.S. businesses may be poised for massive tax reductions, most tech startups have little immediate reason to celebrate. After all, the vast majority are unprofitable. So cutting the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, as Congress has opted to do, has zero effect on their near-term finances.That said, what is true of most new tech ventures is not true of the broader startup ecosystem. Investors, employees, prospective acquirers and others should see a more immediate impact from tax code changes, which could, in turn, affect their decision-making in startup-related matters.What changes might we expect on the horizon? It’s too soon to predict, as Congress has yet to reconcile differences in the House and Senate versions of the tax bill. But it is not too soon to prepare.In an effort to envision how the pending tax bill might affect U.S. startups and their investors, Crunchbase News reached out to tech industry taxation experts. We touched on topics including the M&A climate, tax treatment of interest expenses and whether rising costs of living in high-tax states will prompt an exodus to cheaper locales. Combined with our own analysis, here are some thoughts on the potential impacts.Increase in M&A spendingSo far, 2017 has been a pretty dull year for big-ticket U.S. startup acquisitions. We’ve seen just one big unicorn M&A deal: Cisco’s $3.7 billion purchase of AppDynamics in January.One factor holding up M&A has been uncertainty around tax code changes, notes David Jolley, who leads the American growth markets practice at Ernst & Young. Over the past year, many deep-pocketed acquirers have delayed implementing strategic plans, of which M&A is often a big component. Next year, presuming tax cuts take effect, they could get more active.Large-cap tech companies haven’t been suffering from a shortage of cash, but having more of it also won’t hurt. The tax bill provides some incentives for U.S. companies with cash holdings overseas to repatriate that money. The companies with the largest cash stockpiles overseas are also ones with a history of acquiring startups, including Apple and Microsoft. Lower corporate income tax rates will also put more money into the pockets of the most profitable technology companies.Confusion for startup employeesThe tax bill’s generosity to profitable tech companies does not extend to many of their employees, particularly those in high-tax states.That could be an issue, as startup employees tend to be sought-after specialists. They make a risk-benefit calculus every time they take a job at an entrepreneurial venture. Typically the choice involves accepting a lower salary, longer hours and high cost of living. In exchange, early employees will see a potential payoff from stock options and the adrenaline rush of startup work.The planned tax changes don’t significantly impact those choices, but they will have some impact around the margins. Plans to curb deductions for state and local income taxes, for instance, makes it just a bit more expensive to live in high-tax innovation hubs like Silicon Valley, Boston and New York City.It’s unlikely that a person enthusiastic about joining the next great venture-backed company will be deterred by this cost. But for those on the fence, it could be a factor. On the flip side, lower-tax states with significant tech talent, such as Texas and Utah, could see more startup activity, Jolley predicts.Tax bill provisions that lower rates on so-called pass-through entities also could have an impact, according to CNBC:Under current law, profits from a small business “pass through” to the owner and is taxed at his or her individual rate, which can be as high as 39.6 percent. The Senate’s bill will allow business owners to deduct 23 percent of their income, which will help them save on taxes.The provision creates new incentives, where possible, for specialists to operate as a business rather than simply collecting a paycheck. How this will play out, particularly given the legal complexities around how employers extend equity compensation and classify contractors versus employees, remains to be seen. But it’s something to keep an eye on.More capital sloshing aroundThe bulk of tax cut savings from the proposed bill will go to wealthy investors and corporations. Because startup investors tend to be wealthy fund managers, who are themselves backed by big asset managers, pension funds, endowments and family offices, it’s reasonable to expect this will lead to more available capital to invest.That’s not necessarily a good thing for the venture industry. VC fund partners routinely complain about too much capital chasing too few deals and pushing up valuations to unsustainable levels. The proliferation of private unicorns, many of whom have gone on to produce underwhelming exits, underscores these worries.Nonetheless, startups in need of money do benefit from more abundant capital. Plus, if they ever make it to IPO, more cash in the hands of asset managers means a ready supply of public market buyers for their shares, as well.Late-stage exit timing changesHillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t agree on much. But one thing both campaigns talked about was closing the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows fund managers to classify returns on portfolio investments as long-term capital gains rather than ordinary income.Yet despite the talk, the infamous carried interest loophole survives with a bit of tinkering. Under both the House and Senate proposals, earnings attributable to carried interest will be taxed at the higher short-term capital gain rate unless the assets were held for more than three years. This is a change from the current rules, which allow long-term capital gain treatment on all capital assets if held for greater than one year.The change won’t have much impact on seed and early-stage investors, who typically hold shares in companies for much longer than three years. However, the tax change may impact the timing of investments in later-stage deals, with an eye to ensuring the three-year holding period is met, says Natalie Jessop, leader of the PwC venture capital tax practice.TakeawaysThere are a number of other tax changes that could impact financial planning for startups. As currently drafted, critics say the tax bill undermines the usefulness of research and development tax credits. It also affects timetables for carrying forward operating losses and using them to reduce future taxes.On the bright side, a lower corporate rate should also allow startups to scale their eventual, hoped-for profits faster, as they won’t have to set aside as much for taxes.Overall, the tax bill should give startups the opportunity to engage in much of what they do well: adapting to change and pivoting their business models to capitalize on the new opportunities.Whether all that adapting and pivoting will have a net benefit to the bottom line, however, remains to be seen.",How tax changes may impact US startups  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
"The government and its critics may disagree on the state of public safety amid a ruthless campaign against illegal drugs, but one study has ranked Manila as one of the most unsafe cities in the world.Out of 60 urban areas covered by the Safe Cities Index 2017, Manila ranked among the 10 worst at 55th place, ahead only of Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, the Indonesian capital Jakarta, Bangladesh capital Dhaka, Yangon in Myanmar, and the worst – Karachi in Pakistan. The ranking was drawn up by the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit or EIU.Apart from personal safety, which covers the crime situation and vulnerability to terrorism, the index also considers health security as well as cyber and infrastructure safety. Manila, or more precisely the densely populated capital region called Metro Manila, ranked low in all the indicators.Four of the 10 safest cities are in Asia. Tokyo was ranked as the safest followed by city-state Singapore. Osaka placed third; Hong Kong ninth. The top three all ranked high in terms of personal safety. The other cities in the top 10 are Toronto, Canada; Melbourne, Australia; Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Sydney, Australia; Stockholm, Sweden, and Zurich, Switzerland.Personal safety, as measured in the index, includes the safety even of crime suspects. The world’s safest cities are characterized by low homicide and murder rates, unlike Manila, where thousands have died since last year from police anti-drug operations and drive-by shootings carried out by gunmen on motorcycles.Surveys have shown that while the public generally supports the campaign against the drug menace, people worry about their safety in the streets and even in their own homes, despite police reports that the crime and murder rates are down.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Apart from personal safety, Manila also fared badly in terms of the other indicators.

"The Philippines is on top of the lists of  countries with the most untapped mineral deposits worth around two to four trillion US dollars  according to US Department of State report in Philippine Economy.During the late President Marcos era in 1970s and 1980s, the country ranked among the top 10 leading gold and copper producers worldwide. Today’s mining industry is just a fraction of what the Philippines had three to four decades ago, the Washington-based agency said.“Low metal prices, high production costs and lack of investment in infrastructure contributed to the industry’s overall decline,” the State Department said in the report, which the US Embassy in Manila has posted on its website.The report also noted that government support and promotion is another factor why the Philippine mining industry declines.Some local government also bans mining companies citing environmental destruction and, unequal distribution of tax revenues, unemployment caused by displacement of especially farmers and small-scale miners, and marginalization of indigenous people, the agency said.According to the State Department report, “Philippine copper, gold and  deposits are among the largest in the world.”“Other important minerals include nickel, silver, coal, gypsum and sulfur. The Philippines also has significant deposits of clay, limestone, marble, silica, and phosphate. Natural gas reserves discovered off Palawan have been brought on line to generate electricity,” it said.The said report on Philippine economy also stated that the lack of understanding on proper mining procedures and technology leads to declining mining industry. It also added that if proper mining procedure is applied, Philippines could be the world’s biggest supplier of  , gold, silver, and nickel and could bring the country from poverty to instant progress.The current government has no visible plan on how to use the country’s precious mineral resources to augment its annual budget.The Philippines is going in working direction by focusing on exporting labor force instead of minerals that are highly precious and could save the whole country from poverty in the future, the report said.The earlier report that one of the biggest palladium deposits was found in the countryhas been verified true by the USGS but the government has no plan on what to do next to utilize the country’s rare resources, the agency said.

Of course at his young age he still doesn't know what a lemon looks like and how it tastes.He trusted his parents like he was getting a treat. The lemon was given to him by his mother and he immediately bit the lemon and sipped the juice of the fruit.His next reaction was priceless. After realizing how sour the lemon was he immediately chilled because of the taste of the lemon. If only the baby could speak he would likely say that, ""Mom, Dad.

"Former President and current Pampanga Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo praised the current president, Rodrigo Duterte, for his bold reforms and his ability to “inspire and unite” the people in his first year of presidency. Arroyo said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown awesome leadership and resolve in the many programs that he promised to do during his presidency.”“In his first year, he managed to institute various bold reforms against illegal drugs and corruption. His Build, Build, Build initiative is commendable and is a step in the right direction towards achieving inclusive growth.”Arroyo’s government was marred by numerous controversies in regard to electoral cheating and alleged cases of corruption. However, that did not stop her from once again being voted into a position of power. For the former president, President Duterte managed to inspire and unite the Filipino people. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo stated:“More than his accomplishments in his work as President, President Duterte has achieved to inspire and unite the Filipino people towards his goal of effecting real change for the country. I wish him success and the best of health for the rest of his term as he fulfills his mandate for the nation and for the people.”Shortly after winning the presidential election, Duterte began to develop a close relationship with former president Arroyo. He also appointed many of her former subordinates to office and occasionally seeks her counsel. He also often invites her to official gatherings.Meanwhile, Former Senator Bongbong Marcos, Jr., a known ally of the president, also lauded Duterte for being a “good leader” and establishing an “important position” of the country in the international community. He said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown one singular quality that is very clear and the reason why he is very popular–the quality of leadership. For example, he has redirected our foreign policy and that is the reason why we have regained once again a crucial and important position in the international community to the benefit of the Philippines. It is the same with various domestic policies.”The former senator also said that Filipinos recognize the president’s efforts. Bongbong stated:“Only a good leader can do that and he managed to do just that.”",JUST IN!

His truck hit the rails of a wooden bridge with such force that a beam ripped through the truck.The impact caused the vehicle to flip and land on its roof in the embankment.“I stayed for a bit thinking, someone will see me, someone will rescue me,” MacNeil said.“It got pretty cold pretty fast and water was coming in and I thought, no, if I’m going to get out of this I’ve got to get myself out.”The wooden beam from the bridge went through the front of the truck. (Submitted by Donnie MacNeil)The door wouldn’t open because of the packed snow, so MacNeil rolled down the window and dug until he could get the door cracked open enough to escape.“I didn’t really know until I started to move that my foot was next to my ear. Something was going on, it wasn’t quite right,” he said.MacNeil hoisted himself up on the undercarriage of the truck and dragged himself across to the bank.“I fell in the brook several times and kind of crawled out through the water and made my way up the side of the beams of the bridge. It took quite a while, probably hours, to do that.”Trying to flag down carsNear the side of the quiet highway, soaking and frozen, and with a leg broken in seven places, MacNeil couldn’t even stand to make himself seen by passing cars.“The cold had pretty much taken all the good out of me,” he said.Michael Maclellan, his then wife Cathy MacNeil and their four-month-old son were driving back to Sydney from Baddeck when Maclellan noticed something in the ditch.He told his wife he thought it was a person lying down with his hand up, so he turned the car around.“Sure enough he was there and he was in bad shape… He was extremely cold, vibrating, because he was soaking wet,” Maclellan said.“It was just fluke that I saw him.”Michael Maclellan and his then wife were driving with their four-month-old son when he spotted something in the ditch. (Submitted by Michael Maclellan)Maclellan said his wife drove to the hospital in Baddeck, while he squeezed in beside MacNeil and tried to keep him warm.MacNeil said his memories after that are foggy. Finally warming up and covered in blood, he could feel the extent of the pain in his leg.“The leg kind of exploded from the knee down. There was no bone left from a couple of inches below my knee to my ankle, both bones in my leg were kind of shattered,” he said.Years of wonderingAt the hospital, Maclellan said they made sure doctors had MacNeil and then, “that was the last I ever heard of him.”“They got me in there,” MacNeil recalled. “The last thing I remember was the guy [Maclellan] coming in looking for some paper towel to get the blood out of his truck.”And then moments later, he came back and asked for a bucket and a mop,” MacNeil said, chuckling.MacNeil was transported to Sydney and spent the next nine months in and out of the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries on his leg.But in the days after the accident, he said he tried to find the couple, asking hospital staff and police. “Nobody seemed to know who these folks were.”Last week, MacNeil drove by the bridge again. And that’s when he decided to try searching for them online. His post was shared 5,500 times and eventually, Cathy MacNeil saw it and shared it with her ex-husband, according to Maclellan.After that, Maclellan and Donnie MacNeil started talking over Facebook.Belated thank youIt turns out, in the summer of 1986, Maclellan and his family moved to Calgary, where he still lives. But every summer, he returned to Cape Breton, and would drive along the bridge and wonder what happened to the man he saved.“He figures I saved his life. I don’t know,” Maclellan said.“We’re not doing much more than anybody else would have done in the same situation. Most people would have gave somebody assistance.”As for MacNeil, “I did get a chance to give my belated thank you. I wasn’t sure if I had done it at the time or not given the state I was in, so I wanted to make sure that was the first thing I did.”Maclellan said he hopes to meet up with MacNeil on his yearly return to Nova Scotia next summer.‘You just dive in’MacNeil, far right, said he has told the story to his children over the years. (Submitted by Donnie MacNeil)MacNeil said the accident is a story he’s told to his children over the years.“I was a young guy, I was 19. I considered myself pretty tough, screw the broken leg I’m going for it,” he said.“That’s kind of how I lived my life ever since. You just dive in.”",It was just a fluke that I saw him: Man tracked down by thankful teen he saved in 1986 car crash  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017

"The leader of the group that won this year’s Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday urged nuclear nations to adopt a United Nations treaty banning atomic weapons in order to prevent “the end of us.”The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize by a committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons and the growing risk of an atomic war.ICAN is a coalition of 468 grassroots non-governmental groups that campaigned for a UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted by 122 nations in July.The treaty is not signed by — and would not apply to — any of the states that already have nuclear arms. Beatrice Fihn, ICAN’s executive director, urged them to sign the agreement.“It provides a choice. A choice between the two endings: the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,” she said in her speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.“The United States, choose freedom over fear. Russia, choose disarmament over destruction. Britain, choose the rule of law over oppression,” she added, before urging France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel to do the same.The leader of ICAN, Beatrice Fihn, signs the Nobel protocol next to campaigner and Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow in Oslo, Norway on Saturday. (Audun Braastad/NTB Scanpix/via/Reuters)Israel is widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.“A moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities,” she added.“A calculated military escalation could lead to the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians.”Toronto survivor speaksFihn delivered the Nobel lecture together with Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and now an ICAN campaigner.Thurlow, now a Canadian who lives in Toronto, recalled on stage on Sunday some of her memories of the attack on Aug. 6, 1945.She was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometres from Ground Zero, she said. Most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive.“Processions of ghostly figures shuffled by. Grotesquely wounded people, they were bleeding, burnt, blackened and swollen,” she said.“Parts of their bodies were missing. Flesh and skin hung from their bones. Some with their eyeballs hanging in their hands. Some with their bellies burst open, their intestines hanging out. The foul stench of burnt human flesh filled the air.”The United States, Britain and France sent second-rank diplomats to the Nobel ceremony, which Fihn earlier told Reuters was “some kind of protest.”",Nobel Peace Prize group urges nuclear powers to adopt ban-the-bomb treaty  MaharlikaNews @ykhy CW051017
