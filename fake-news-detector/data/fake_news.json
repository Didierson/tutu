    "body": "With Finance Secretary, Carlos Dominguez in Davao, Monday was D-Day for a new economic thrust which signals that time for ‘business-as-usual’ is over.President-Elect Rodrigo Duterte’s 10-point socio-economic agenda was laid out before a consultative summit, attended by the Philippines major business groups, in the southern Mindanao city. Among those gathered there were representatives of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Employers Confederation of the Philippines, the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Management Association of the Philippines. Socio-economics for the country and its peopleThis then, was not a junket held for the benefit of the great and the good of corporate Manila, it was a taking of the pulse of groups that battle daily with the difficulties of boosting trade for the archipelago and its people. These organisations are in the struggle to land foreign investment; to broaden the economy, and to release that economy from the narrow ownership that has kept it trailing much of the region. To these groups that is serious business.The summit’s location is significant. Davao City is 930 air miles away from the capital – that’s about as far from Makati as it’s possible to get and still be in the Philippines. But while it’s the home town of Duterte and Dominguez, holding a conference of this importance there represents something much more – it issues a declaration that there has been a shift of power from “Imperial Manila” to the regions.This is in line with Duterte’s federalist ambitions for the country; for the country it’s in line with their hopes that, this time, the trickle down will come – that the National Capital Region will no longer be, disproportionately, the major beneficiary of an improving economy.Ironically, much of Manila’s abject poor are not from Manila at all, they are part of the constant wave of humanity that floods to the city from the jobless wastelands of the countryside in the belief that it must be better there than where they’re coming from. Sadly, for most, it’s not. The poverty rate in the Philippines last year was 25%; the United Nations 2015 Millennium Development Goals was to get it down to 16.6%. Let’s put that in a Southeast Asia context: Thailand 10.2%, Indonesia 11.3%, Malaysia 0.6% (2014), Vietnam 13.5%.It’s likely that the switch of business venue from Metropolitan Manila will ruffle a few feathers in the corporate corridors of the capital. That might not have been unintentional. Last month, Duterte lambasted members of the Makati Business Club (MBC) as “a bunch of elitist fools”. But then he wasn’t exactly their first choice to be the new occupant of Malacañang, the presidential palace – actually, he was there last (though few would probably admit to that now).A month earlier, following his talk to the MBC, its executive director, Peter Perfecto, commented that his members were disappointed by the lack of substance in Duterte’s delivery, “especially on the economy and doing business. That is what we asked for from the [presidential] candidates”.We don’t have a copy of the Davao Summit’s registration or guest list, but it would not surprise us if the MBC, as an entity, was not included – and if that’s the case, it will be another clear signal that Makati’s position at centre stage of the country’s commercial dealings has been eclipsed.In many ways, Makati symbolises everything that Duterte wants to change in the country’s corporate culture. Today’s Central Business District can trace its nascence back to the mid 19th century when Don José Bonifacio Roxas, a patriarch of the Ayala-Roxas clan, bought the farm lands of Hacienda San Pedro de Macati from its Jesuit owners for PHP 52,800 – that’s US$1,136.13 at today’s exchange rate.Ever since, this district and its development have been the sphere of influence of the Zóbel de Ayala family whose antecedents came from the Basque Country in Spain’s western Pyrenees in the early 1800s. And since the 1960s it has been the capital’s commercial hub – the Makati Stock Exchange opened there in 1963, banks and associated firms moved in as high-rise offices started to sprout up, and by the end of the decade Makati had established itself as the uncontested centre of business for the entire country.Also missing from the gathering, we’re sure, would be certain sectors of a group that is normally in full attendance on such occasions – the media. The event was well-covered by the major networks, but the press knows that their previously unquestioned demands for government access received a major body blow when Paris-based, non-profit, NGO, Reporters Without Borders (RWB), blustered into a local fight between Duterte and the domestic media, over comments he has made about corrupt journalists paying for their crimes with their lives. With a mind-boggling lack of nouse, the over-zealous RWB prompted the local media to boycott Duterte’s events and sue him for defamation – well, they were only trying to help. That may be in the Paris Playbook for Promoting Press Freedom but it won’t work anywhere in Southeast Asia. What it will get you in this region is what it got the Philippine press for the past couple of weeks – a closed door. This abrasion will take some time to heal.Duterte has wasted no time in putting down his marker – he doesn’t take his oath of office for another week. But there’s no ambiguity in his message: the ‘Manila elite’ and their indulged press entourages and fawning lobbyists will not be the favourites of this political court.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration blames North Korea for a ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide in May and crippled parts of Britain’s National Health Service.Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Monday night that North Korea was “directly responsible” for the WannaCry ransomware attack and that Pyongyang will be held accountable for it.Bossert said the administration’s finding of responsibility is based on evidence and confirmed by other governments and private companies, including the United Kingdom and Microsoft.“North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behavior is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless,” he wrote.Bossert said the Trump administration will continue to use its “maximum pressure strategy to curb Pyongyang’s ability to mount attacks, cyber or otherwise.”At a news conference on Tuesday, he said U.S. officials had shared their assessment with several other governments.“The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in condemning North Korea for WannaCry,” Bossert said.Britain chimes inThe WannaCry attack struck more than 150 nations in May, locking up digital documents, databases and other files and demanding a ransom for their release.It battered Britain’s National Health Service, where the cyberattack froze computers at hospitals across the country, closing emergency rooms and bringing medical treatment to a halt.Britain joined the U.S. on Tuesday in publicly blaming Pyongyang for the ransomware incident. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre had assessed it was highly likely that North Korea’s Lazarus hacking group was behind the attack, the Foreign Office said.“We condemn these actions and commit ourselves to working with all responsible states to combat destructive criminal use of cyberspace,” Foreign Office Minister Tariq Ahmad said. “The indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyberprogram to circumvent sanctions,” Ahmad said.Employees watch electronic boards to monitor possible ransomware cyberattacks at the Korea Internet and Security Agency in Seoul on May 15. (Yun Dong-jin/Yonhap via Associated Press)Government offices in Russia, Spain, and several other countries were also disrupted by the cyberattack, as were Asian universities, Germany’s national railway and global companies such as automakers Nissan and Renault.Stolen NSA cyberweaponsThe WannaCry ransomware exploited a vulnerability in mostly older versions of Microsoft’s Windows operating system. Affected computers had generally not been patched with security fixes that would have blocked the attack. Security experts, however, traced the exploitation of that weakness back to the U.S. National Security Agency. It was part of a cache of stolen NSA cyberweapons publicly released by a group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers.The WannaCry ransomware attack used NSA code that exploited a software vulnerability found in multiple versions of Microsoft’s Windows operating system, and was known by the codename EternalBlue, according to experts. (The Associated Press)Microsoft president Brad Smith likened the theft to “the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,” and argued that intelligence agencies should disclose such vulnerabilities rather than hoarding them.WannaCry came to a screeching halt thanks to enterprising work by a British hacker named Marcus Hutchins, who discovered that the malware’s author had embedded a “kill switch” in the code. Hutchins was able to trip that switch, and the attack soon ended. In an unusual twist, Hutchins was arrested months later by the FBI during a visit to the U.S. He pleaded not guilty and now awaits trial on charges he created unrelated forms of malware.The United States and South Korea have accused North Korea of launching a series of cyberattacks in recent years, though the North has dismissed the accusations.Accusations from SeoulA South Korean lawmaker in October said North Korean hackers stole highly classified military documents that include U.S.-South Korean wartime “decapitation strike” plans against the North Korean leadership. Seoul’s Defence Ministry earlier said North Korea was likely behind the hacking of the Defence Integrated Data Centre, which is the military data centre where the information was kept, in September of last year. But the Defence Ministry refused to confirm the nature of the information that was compromised.South Korea also last year accused North Korea of hacking the personal data of more than 10 million users of an online shopping site and dozens of email accounts used by government officials and journalists.In 2014, the United States formally accused North Korea of hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment over the movie The Interview, a satirical film about a plot to assassinate North Korea’s leader.South Korea said in 2015 that North Korea had a 6,000-member cyberarmy dedicated to disrupting the South’s government and military. The figure was a sharp increase from a 2013 South Korean estimate of 3,000 such specialists.Baik Tae-hyun, spokesperson for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which deals with matters related to North Korea, said Monday that the Seoul government was examining whether the North was behind hacking attacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in June. About $7 million US in digital money was stolen in the hacks, South Korean officials said.There’s speculation in the South that North Korean hackers are possibly targeting cryptocurrency like bitcoin to evade the heavy financial sanctions imposed over the country’s nuclear weapons and missiles program.“We are monitoring the bitcoin-related issue. We believe that North Korea is currently engaging in various activities to evade sanctions and earn foreign currency,” Baik said.",

    "body": "Worst Airports for Overall ExperienceDate: October 15, 2017In our annual survey, we ask travellers to rate airports worldwide based on their overall airport experience. They ranked their overall experience based on these factors:Comfort (Gate seating & availability of rest zones)Services, facilities & things to doFood optionsImmigration/SecurityCustomer serviceCleanlinessNavigation and ease of transitSleepabilityThe airports that appear on our list of the worst in the world are the ones that have the capacity to truly offend travellers. Within these terminals, there appears to be a general disinterest in a positive traveller experience. In some cases, passengers are made to stand or sit on the floor as they await their flights. In others, the bathrooms don’t have water, toilet paper, or any semblance of cleanliness. In some cases, the physical structure of the airport is fine, but the personnel are the problem. Got a problem? Don't expect much in terms of customer service at these airports. If you find yourself travelling through one of these 20 terminals, brace yourself. You’ll want to give yourself just enough time to get in and get out. A minute more and you’ll be unhappy and uncomfortable - a minute less, and you risk missing your flight. Good luck!This year, we supersized the list, so here we go with the Top 20 Worst Airports in the World based on overall airport experience, as determined by voters in our 2017 Airport Survey.1. Juba International Airport, South Sudan (JUB)As photography has been banned in South Sudan, we present you with this artist's rendering to show you the current state of Juba AirportWhen I passed through a few weeks ago, it was a tent with a rotting plywood floor full of dangerous holes. I have heard rumours now that the floor has collapsed completely. The tents leak during rainy season. You must wade through mud puddles to get to the check-in desk. - survey respondentThe travel situation in Juba has further deteriorated in the past year, earning this airport the title of Worst Airport in the World. This year, the airport hit a new low with tents now serving as the primary terminal facilities, while the existing terminal has continued to undergo “renovations” since 2012. The litany of complaints about Juba airport could fill several pages, but we’ll just try to succinctly summarize the worst of the worst. We already noted the lack of a real roof, but we should also mention the rotting plywood floors, and reports that people often fall through them. There is a noticeable lack of seating, but this may not be much of a concern, as most available seating tends to be broken or literally falling through the plywood floor. At Juba Airport, travellers don’t bother to complain about things like the lack of Wi-Fi and charging points - they’re more concerned about the lack of electricity in 40 degree Celsius heat! Non-existent air conditioning turns the tents into miniature sweat boxes. Voters also reported major crowds, horrific smells and filth, high heat, rain leaking into the tent, corruption and a lot of security walking around with guns. While time spent here is invariably unpleasant, we recognize that South Sudan is a war-torn state that perhaps has more pressing concerns.See also: Worst Airports in AfricaAirport Services/Facilities: none.

You are in holy spiritual mood before you arrive. But the minute you touch the terminal you see trash everywhere, dirty toilets, no toilet attandents, long q's. The immigration officers are the worst in world. - survey respondentJeddah Airport’s position on our list of Worst Airports in the World improved slightly, likely because a war-torn nation’s primary airport indeed proved to be worse. Survey respondents have repeatedly ranked Jeddah King Abdulaziz Airport as among the worst, but that could change with the opening of a new replacement airport within the year. In anticipation of the new airport, travellers noted that the new facilities may be worthless if they fail to replace the airport and immigration staff, or, at the very least, revise the staff mindset that seems to make them the crux of the airport’s failings. Airport personnel are described as rude, lazy, and incompetent, but special vitriol is reserved for customs and immigration officials. Not only are there not enough officers, which leads to long queues, but the few working tend to their tasks in slow motion. Staff were not the only complaint, however, as voters suggest that cleanliness must be addressed.. The toilets are reportedly rarely cleaned and often dysfunctional. Insufficient seating is another grievance, as the terminals are frequently crowded, particularly during Hajj season. In short, don't expect comfort, entertainment, or any semblance of customer service. On a positive note, the operators of Singapore Changi Airport have recently been awarded the contract to operate the new Jeddah Airport. Judging by all the feedback we received, it sounds like the new management team will have their hands full. Good luck to them! Until then, brace yourself.See also: Worst Airports for LayoverAirport Services/Facilities: Pay-per-use Lounge ($) • Free WiFi.

Port Harcourt International Airport, Nigeria (PHC)It doesn't matter what type of VISA you have, they will tell you it's the wrong one and you must pay for the correct one. Inefficiency is rampant with people repeatedly going through your luggage and asking for $ or for you to do something for them. Virtually every person there seeks to extort $ from you. You will hear the phrase \"You have something for me?\" over and over. - survey respondentApparently things haven’t changed much at Port Harcourt Airport, as it ranked third worst for overall passenger experience. This year’s survey respondents indicated that aggressive corruption is the biggest problem, with airport officials and staff allegedly demanding bribes for pretty much everything. Other complaints included lack of bathroom facilities, lack of air conditioning, horrible baggage handling, and the tent that serves as the arrivals terminal. If you can overlook the bribery component, departures are said to be a bit more pleasant than arrivals, as the departures terminal is an actual building.See also: Worst Airports in AfricaAirport Services/Facilities: none.

Crete Heraklion International Airport, Greece (HER)If ever you are going to miss your flight due to poor organisation it will be here!!! - survey respondentEvery year, a slew of Greek airports make it onto our list of Worst Airports in the World - this year Heraklion leads the pack. At Heraklion Airport, like many of the Greek Islands airports, travellers queue outside the airport since the terminal hasn’t got the capacity to hold everyone. Travellers frequently report long queues, inefficient staff, filthy bathrooms, lack of air conditioning, and general overcrowding. Survey respondents also noted a distinctive lack of seating, poor security, and extended wait times for both check-in and luggage. There are a few restaurants inside the airport, but the prices tend to be steep given the quality. All in all, it’s best not to let this airport experience colour an otherwise delightful Greek island.

Don't tell them you have cash, otherwise, the customs offical will take you to the dark room. But if you give the money to the Nigerian Offical, you can bring anything on to the plane. - survey respondentThe government of Nigeria, with the help of Chinese investors, has poured almost a half-billion dollars into refurbishing Nigeria’s airports. Unfortunately, for many voters, there appears to be no discernible difference in the operation and facilities of Lagos International Airport. One word likely explains why - “corruption”. This happens to be the number one traveller complaint about Lagos Airport. Add to this filthy bathrooms, limited seating, archaic check-in procedures, sporadic air conditioning, and lousy customer service, and you’re not likely to enjoy your time here. Fortunately the airport does host a number of pay-to-use lounges that might make an extended stay a bit more bearable.See also: Worst Airports in AfricaAirport Services/Facilities: Pay-per-use Lounges ($).

The airport terminal should be erased and a new one erected. - survey respondentSantorini's ranking improved slightly this year; however, it is unclear if improvements were made or the airports listed before it just got worse. The bottom line here seems to be that the terminal is much too small and understaffed for the number of passengers. Reviewers report long waits outside in exposed heat, in lines that may or may not lead to the correct check-in counter. Still, being outdoors may be better than the “chaotic overcrowded sweaty mosh pit” you may find once inside the terminal. Getting to the airport super early may not help much, as many flights are reportedly delayed by two hours due to disorganized check-in and security procedures. One traveller’s advice? Take the ferry home.See also: Worst Airports in EuropeAirport Services/Facilities: None. For more information, visit our Santorini Airport Guide or read Santorini Airport Reviews.7. Dar es Salaam Julius Nyerere International Airport, Tanzania (DAR)We had to wait here for 6 hours. Lack of places to go and eat or just sit. Toilets are awful and not enough to cope with numbers. - survey respondentDar es Salaam Airport is a small international airport with no real amenities and enough passenger dissatisfaction to rank it among the worst for overall experience. A major complaint seems to be that passengers are often forced to wait outside the terminal on uncomfortable benches until check-in time. Once inside, conditions don’t improve much, as there seems to be limited seating and food options that perhaps should be avoided. Staff are described as either rude, unknowledgeable, or a combination of both. Though it's not much of a saving grace, some passengers reported that they were able to catch some Zs as the benches - both indoor and outdoor - are armrest-free.See also: Worst Airports in AfricaAirport Services/Facilities: Pay-per-use Lounges ($).

The line is so long you started outside. Then you need to go back in the line again right next to it to check in your baggage. - survey respondentAt Rhodes International Airport, voter complaints echo those filed against Heraklion and Santorini: outdoor queues under the hot sun, appalling bathrooms, and lack of air conditioning in the tiny terminals.. Customer service is, according to one voter, “diabolical”, and the harsh industrial lighting over metal benches does little to appease passengers. It's best to come to this airport self-sufficient and prepared, so you don't have to rely on the limited amenities.

Your only options are to wait the night on an uncomfortable steel bench outside or walk around the parking to keep warm. - survey respondentIf you’re travelling out of Paris Beauvais-Tille Airport, a little planning will make your time here significantly more pleasant. First, know that the airport is located over 90 minutes from Paris central. Second, you should note that it closes from 11pm to 6am, and nearby hotels are not budget-friendly. If you have an early morning flight and you are planning to go to the airport the night before to sleep in the terminal - don't do it! Finally, be aware that the airport itself is extremely basic, offering a few dining options inside two bare-bones terminals. With these three facts in mind, consider whether buying a ticket from one of the budget airlines that serve BVA is worth it to you - and if it is, come prepared.

Because there are some \"service personnel\" who can help people to queue jump for a price of $10-$20. Process is slow, people are fed up and they give those \"service personnel\" that amount to pass through faster. The money would be shared with Immigration Officers. Avoid. - survey respondentTashkent is the first Asian airport on our list of Worst Airports in the World. While it sounds like slight improvements have been made to the international terminal, travellers still lament the worn-out seats and exceptionally long queues. Some voters alleged corruption, in the form of security and immigration officials asking for bribes from passengers. As planes disembark, the airport is quickly overwhelmed, transforming passport control into a zoo - where you should be prepared to defend your place in line. Worse still, while the Wi-Fi got reasonable reviews last year, it may be a bit of a decline, with travellers reporting frequent disconnects.

It's managed to get even worse in the last year, and that is an achievement I hadn't expected. - survey respondentRenovations carried on this past year at London Luton, which continue to wreak havoc on the traveller experience. The airport itself is hectic at best - and utter chaos more often than not. After navigating massive queues and confusing processes, travellers quickly learn that there is nowhere for them to sit as they wait for their flights. Those who figured a snack might help ease their woes were further horrified by the prices, with one voter declaring that “the only thing Luton does well is take your money.” While we hope that these renovations will eventually give way to something more amenable, it’s going to be a long road to recovery.

Rome Ciampino International Airport, Italy (CIA)I had to sleep outside, together with 200 people, because no one had informed us the airport closes at night. - survey respondentRome Ciampino is the city’s secondary airport, and it is largely served by budget airlines. While the price of your ticket will definitely be appealing, you will definitely want to reconsider that early morning flight - especially if you plan on spending the night in the terminal. Keep in mind that the airport closes overnight (midnight to 4am), and terminal staff will evict those who want to stay. This left a number of disgruntled voters huddled up outside, trying to catch some sleep on chilly nights. Assuming you’re able to plan around this obstacle, the airport itself is fairly bare-bones. According to respondents, the Wi-Fi is unreliable, the food choices are bleak, and chairs are virtually non-existent.See also: Worst Airports in EuropeAirport Services/Facilities: Free WiFi.

Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal (KTM)I was told that my passport picture looked nothing liked me and he wasn't sure if I would be allowed to leave. I explained I had travelled all over the world with it and it's fine. He said \"well I don't know perhaps you have something that could move this along\". I laughed so hard and said get your boss right now, at that point, miraculously my picture looked like me again! - survey respondentKathmandu’s international airport is, according to most voters, chaotic, crowded, and, at times, corrupt. The airport greets visitors with disorganization, spawned by a lack of flight information, signage, or any semblance of a logical layout. The bathrooms are upsetting, with voters describing them as ”grotesque”, “deadly” and a “horrifyingly terrible place”. The staff do little to organize the crowds, making the terminal feel more like a rugby scrum than anything else. Of course we do recognize that Nepal has had a difficult few years, and we can understand that airport enhancements aren’t at the top of the national priority list.

New York City LaGuardia, USA (LGA)LaGuardia is the perfect definition of a 3rd world airport in a developing country acting as a 1st world airport, no other way to explain it. - survey respondentNew York City’s LaGuardia Airport joins the top 20 worst overall experience list despite ongoing reconstruction designed to improve deteriorating conditions, such as ceiling leaks and flooding. According to survey respondents, time spent at LGA is no picnic, with large crowds, long lines, limited seating, few food and beverage options, rude and incompetent staff, and an apparent refuge for New York City’s homeless, who roam the airport’s landside facilities at night. If you do find yourself catching a flight out of LaGuardia, be prepared to wait, as the airport leads the nation in flight delays. While the reconstruction effort may not address the significant delays, when completed in 2021, it may at least result in a more comfortable wait.

Chania International Airport, Greece (CHQ)It's the hottest place in the island, if there was a swimming pool inside, there would be no need to leave the airport. - survey respondentAs the fifth busiest airport in Greece, Chania Airport’s ranking in the list for worst overall experience is likely due to overcapacity issues. Designed to serve 1.3 million, the airport is currently serving more than 3 million annual passengers. Thus primary grievances include lack of seating, filthy bathrooms, disorganized staff, long queues, sporadic Wi-Fi, lack of air conditioning, and limited food options. Needless to say, sleeping in this airport while awaiting your flight is likely not a viable option. A few reviewers reported that conditions seemed to be improving, as the airport is included in a joint Greco-German plan to upgrade 14 of Greece’s airports.See also: Worst Airports in EuropeAirport Services/Facilities: none.

Improve: \"EVERYTHING \"- survey respondentGiven the depths of Venezuela’s economic problems, it is perhaps no surprise to see this airport on the list of Worst Airports for Overall Experience. One survey respondent commented that Caracas Airport does not have a “friendly environment”. This may be an understatement when you consider the description of another passenger, who was allegedly mugged right outside the entrance while a cadre of security guards sat calmly inside. Along with this general lack of security, add in poor temperature control, lack of facility maintenance, limited seating, filthy restrooms, and poor service.Airport Services/Facilities: Pay-per-use Lounges ($) • Free WiFi • 24-hour Food Options ($) • Luggage Storage ($).

It's as organised as a toddler's room after they've tipped over their Lego box - survey respondentChina’s second busiest airport is in a sorry state. Disorganized and dirty, Guangzhou tests the patience of those who travel through by presenting them with overpriced food, unfriendly staff, and Wi-Fi reserved for those with Chinese mobile phone numbers. Seating options are in short supply as well, leaving many survey respondents aimlessly ambling around the perimeter. The airport does, we suppose, have a few better features: there are drinking fountains, some English signage, and a China Southern business lounge with beds. It’s a low bar, but we’ll take what we can get.See also: Worst Airports in Asia • Worst Airports for a LayoverAirport Services/Facilities: Pay-per-use Lounges ($) • Free WiFi • 24-hour Food Options ($) • Showers ($).

Cluj International Airport, Romania (CLJ)The waiting area is incredibly small and there are mice traps all over the airport - survey respondentVarious metrics can be used to determine the worst overall airport experience, but disorganization, long queues, and rude staff are travellers' top complaints about Romania’s Cluj Airport. As a small airport, it lacks shops and dining options, and its seating is insufficient for the hordes of people waiting for flights. Climate control also seems to be an issue, with travellers suggesting that air conditioning is used during winter and heating in the summer.

It’s totally embarrassing that this the main airport for Pakistan - survey respondentWith a current annual passenger count nearing 5 million and growing by 14 percent each year, the new replacement airport for Islamabad International Airport cannot open soon enough. The existing airport simply does not have enough space to accommodate passengers or aircraft, according to numerous survey responses. At ISB, expect a lack of services, limited and uncomfortable seating, and long wait times. As it stands now, the new airport is supposed to begin operating commercial flights this December, but the opening has already been delayed for two years.

Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, Ethiopia (ADD)Everytime I have to travel via Bole, I die a little.- survey respondentAddis Ababa’s international airport was voted the second worst airport in the world for a layover. It seems, however, that if you’re using it as a destination, things aren’t as bad. Sure, the bathrooms are described as “creepy” and “disgusting” and are sometimes flooded. And, sure, the staff have a tendency to be unhelpful or rude. It’s not great that the Wi-Fi often doesn't work, and that the restaurant options are bleak. However, if this is your home airport or your final destination, you can probably get in and out of the airport quickly enough - sparing you from experiencing the airport’s worst sides.

Other times, we go to the nearest establishment to use their bathroom.One such netizen reportedly found a hidden camera installed in a fast food chain’s comfort room.According to the report of Viral4Real, the netizen claimed that she found a USB in the comfort room of a Jollibee branch. However, the source did not cite the specific branch of the fast food chain. They implied that the camera was disguised as a USB.The netizen took it home and got surprised when she found out that there were lots of videos in the USB. It was videos of people taking off their pants/dresses/skirts and relieving themselves. Reportedly, it also contained clips from other comfort rooms, not just from the fast food chain alone.It seemed as if someone was secretly recording clips of people relieving themselves in comfort rooms in different places. It was not clear if an application may have been installed in the USB which acted as the camera in public places, or if the USB merely contained such video clips.Unfortunately, the source didn’t mention the exact places where the cameras were supposedly installed, although it could be assumed that all of them were public and therefore, can be easily accessible. Needless to say, this is not the first time that such instances have been reported.In May 2017, Fox News reported that a “spy camera” was found in a fast food chain’s comfort room. The incident happened in a Chipotle Mexican Grill located in Texas, United States. The source said the following:“According to a lawsuit filed this week in the District Court of Brazaria County, Texas, the plantiffs allege that store manager Joanny Castillo, 18, repeatedly installed a video-recording spy camera in the women’s bathroom area and, when informed of the Castillo’s actions, the restaurant’s corporate office tried to cover up the incidents. According to the suit, an unnamed woman and her 5-year-old daughter were filmed taking off their clothes and going to the restroom.”Meanwhile, here are some of the netizens’ comments on the supposed hidden cameras installed in fast food chains:What do you think of this, readers? Please be careful when using comfort rooms of a fast food chain! Apart from being less hygienic, they may contain hidden cameras as well. Let us know your thoughts about this in the comments section below!",

The worried wife knew that his job at Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) wasn’t easy. The hours are long while the work they put into mending families and helping kids can be so difficult. Plus all their hard work usually isn’t appreciated. So Chellie expected her husband might have gone somewhere or done something to unwind. But when he still wasn’t home hours after she expected him to be, Chellie knew that something was up.So the worried wife dropped by Jason’s office to find him. But who knew that what would greet her was a priceless image of her husband’s dedication to do the best he can for the children he works with?Jason was sitting on his chair, feet propped up on another – fast asleep. But what made this more special was that he was holding a sleeping child as well, the same child he was working with on that day. It would appear her tired husband had stayed behind to make sure the child in his care remained safe and watched over.Chellie’s husband was a dedicated man in a harsh job that takes so much out of a person but most of the time leaves them unappreciated.As she puts it:“You never hear anyone say ‘oh yay, here comes DFACS.’ They run and avoid, lie and don’t cooperate, when the job they are going is trying to help the children.”“He among many others do a very thankless yet fulfilling job and it takes a very special person to handle these cases. Yet the case workers and investigators are hardly recognized when there is something great that happens.“But here was her husband, giving everything for the job. Even if it meant staying up late to be with a child that had been upset over the new environment and waking up early to accompany that child again. She was so proud of Jason and needed to capture the beautiful moment.“His focus was to make sure this baby was cared for and felt safe. After taking this baby into the care of the state, in the process of placing him into foster care, he had to stay after hours and return to pick him back up before hours. Being away from family and familiar faces, the baby was kinda fussy and so he was soothing him and well, needless to say, they had a special moment.“It would appear this worried wife had nothing to be anxious about in the first place.Did you expect that that would be the sight Chellie would witness?

He’s even addressed his own retirement. And on his flight back from the Philippines this week, he started chatting about the church’s position on birth control, saying some think that to be good Catholics, “we have to be like rabbits.”Here’s his exact words from the Vatican Insider:I believe that three children per family, from what the experts say, is the key number for sustaining the population. The key word here is responsible parenthood and each person works out how to exercise this with the help of their pastor. … Sorry, some people think that in order to be good Catholics we have to breed like rabbits, right? Responsible parenthood: This is why there are marriage support groups in the Church with people who are experts on such issues; and there are pastors and I know that there are many acceptable solutions that have helped with this. And another thing: For poor people, children are a treasure, prudence is needed here too, it is true. Responsible parenthood but also recognizing the generosity of that father or mother who see their child as a treasure.He referenced a woman he met several months ago who was pregnant with her eighth child after going through seven Cesarean sections.“That is an irresponsibility!” he said, saying she might argue that she should trust in God. “But God gives you methods to be responsible.”Although he upholds the church’s stance against contraception, he talked about “licit” birth control methods approved by the church, alluding to tracking a woman’s cycle to avoid unplanned pregnancies.Pope Francis also spoke about state terrorism, freedom of expression and corruption — both in government and in the church. Then he started chatting about how some officials tried to bribe him in 1994 in Buenos Aires:I had just been appointed auxiliary bishop in the Flores district when two ministry officials came up to me. They said to me: “You are really in need with with these poor people. … If you want we can help by giving you 400 thousand pesos.” …I listened carefully because when you’re offered such a large sum it’s enough to make even a saint think twice. Then they said to me: “To make this donation, we will pay a deposit and then you give us half of the money.” At that moment I thought: Do I insult them and kick them where the sun don’t shine or do I act dumb? I acted dumb. I said to them: “You know … those of us who work in the vicariates don’t have access to the account, you have to pay a deposit to the archbishopric with a receipt.”excerpt from: trendingnewzCommentscomments",

This Post has been shared more than 210 times and counting as of Wednesday evening.Read his Open Letter:While I encourage Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to sign a waiver for all bank accounts in his name I really have something to say about this.Why is it in our country that the accused is given the burden of proof?Hindi ba ang dapat magpatunay, ang dapat maglabas ng ebidensiya ay ang accuser?If you accuse someone of a crime as grave as you think it is, should you not be ready to back it up with evidence? Instead you dare the accused to comply with your silly demands so you can corner him. So yes, I want Duterte to sign your silly waiver if only to prove his innocence. But I also dare Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, for once, to back up his accusations with proof. Duterte does not have to comply with Trillanes’ demands. He does not have to do anything at all.

    "body": "Companies that beg their followers for some help in boosting their presence on Facebook will need to take a new tack.Facebook said in a statement on Monday that it will begin clamping down on “engagement bait” across its social network starting this week. When pages ask for their fans to like, share, comment, or perform other actions on their content to boost the reach and get others who are not following them to see their content, Facebook will penalize them, the company said. It’ll do that by “demoting” posts from people that do a page’s bidding, as well as the pages themselves.“To help us foster more authentic engagement, teams at Facebook have reviewed and categorized hundreds of thousands of posts to inform a machine learning model that can detect different types of engagement bait,” Facebook operations integrity specialist Henry Silverman and Facebook engineer Lin Huang said in a statement. “Posts that use this tactic will be shown less in News Feed.”Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletterGetting more user engagement generally helps Facebook pages, which can be owned by companies, individuals, or other establishments, to boost their notoriety on the social network. That, in turn, could increase the number of people who follow those pages and ultimately help them improve their marketing capacity. But by asking for engagement, pages are effectively creating undesirable content that clogs up News Feeds and makes Facebook less user-friendly. Now Facebook is trying to do something about it.The move is similar to algorithm changes Google makes to its search results to remove websites and webpages that aim only at getting users to click and don’t actually provide useful content.Looking ahead, Facebook said that it will use “stricter demotions” on pages that ignore its reprisals and continue to post engagement bait. But the company was also quick to note that fundraising efforts, people asking for travel tips, or circulating a missing child report that seek others’ engagement will not be demoted.",

    "body": "Pulse Asia: Duterte is most trusted among 4 most recent PresidentsPresident Rodrigo Duterte has the highest public approval and trust rating out of the four most recent chief executives, a comparison by polling firm Pulse Asia showed.As of September 2017, Duterte got an 80 percent trust and approval rating, higher than any rating earned by his predecessors Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III.He is also the most trusted president upon assuming office with an initial trust rating of 91 percent in July 2016.The former Davao City mayor is also the sole chief executive among the 4 to get approval ratings above 80 percent. His highest was 86 percent in September 2016, while his lowest rating was 78 percent in March of this year.Next to Duterte, Aquino recorded the highest rating at the onset of his term with a 79 percent approval rating and an 80 percent trust rating in October 2010. Arroyo, meanwhile, recorded the lowest trust and approval ratings among the 4 presidents with a 10 percent trust rating in February 2010 and a 14 percent approval rating in March 2010, a few months before she stepped down from office. Both Estrada and Aquino suffered a drop in their approval ratings during the end of their terms while Arroyo left her post with a 2 percent increase, ending her term with a 16 percent rating in July 2010. Aquino also saw a boost in his trust rating just before he left office, with 49 percent in March 2016 from 39 percent in February of the same year. Malacañang expressed appreciation for the “people’s verdict” on Duterte, saying the President is humbled by the survey results. “The President accepts this public appreciation with all humility, but regardless of survey results, PRRD (President Rodrigo Roa Duterte) and the members of his Cabinet would continue to work and advance public interests and build, as he said in numerous occasions, a nation worthy of the Filipinos,” the Palace said in a statement Friday. Duterte, a latecomer in the May 2016 national elections, won the presidency on the promise of ending the scourge of illegal drugs and corruption in government sourceCommentscomments",

To kill a priest is to crucify Christ. The priest is alter Christus (another Christ),” he said.Policemen were seen at the cathedral grounds during the funeral Mass but they kept their distance.After the hourlong Mass, friends and family brought out Paez’s casket while priests and activists sang the popular protest song, “Bayan Ko.”Read more from the source inquirerCommentscomments",

    "body": "The cobra is one of the deadliest snakes known throughout the world. One bite from these reptiles and you could instantly lose your life if the venom isn’t given immediate medical attention.One unfortunate teenager from Indonesia lost his life after he forced his pet cobra to have a picture of him. According to Daily Mail, Aril tried to take a picture of it inside his house located in Bundung Regency in the West Java province.The 14-year-old shared the images on his WhatsApp account in the morning. The cobra could be seen extending its hood before it eventually struck Aril.The picture was captioned with “Why not smile a little.” The report cited that Aril had bathed it before he attempted to have a pictorial with the creature.The second picture that Aril uploaded showed a bloody arm with a shoelace tied near the bitten area. It was captioned with “Between life and death.”Neuis Marpuah, his mother, said in an interview, “Aril’s status wasn’t to boast [about his injury] but to ask his friends for help.” According to her, Aril was completely alone when the tragic incident occurred.The teenager also reportedly wrote on social media, “If anyone considers themselves my friend, please take me to the hospital.”An hour after, an individual brought him to the hospital but he was declared dead later the same day at around 10:00 p.m. The emergency treatment failed to revive him.According to the source, Aril was an owner of “more than a dozen snakes.”He was also an active member of a non-government organization that held street performances involving dangerous reptiles. The organization aims to raise money for charities which in turn helps victims of natural disasters.Marpuah also stated that her husband was overseas at the time of the incident.Meanwhile, here are the netizens’ comments about the issue:As much as we love our pets, always remember to respect their boundaries as wild animals. Our condolences go out to those affected by this tragedy.Do you also have a pet cobra? Do you like snakes? Please be careful when handling them.

    "body": "Comedienne Pokwang recently took to Instagram to let out her frustration over her noisy neighbors. According to the actress, her neighbors were singing karaoke until past 12 in the midnight, causing her and her mother to have difficulty sleeping. Currently eight months pregnant, Pokwang claims that she already has trouble sleeping even without the noise, and her neighbors’ karaoke-ing made it more difficult for her to get some sleep.In her Instagram post, the comedienne explained about how she asked her helper to talk to her neighbors in the hopes that they would turn down the volume of their karaoke machine. However, instead of an amicable arrangement, an elder, presumably her neighbor, suddenly started shouting and cursing at her helper. Pokwang lives in an exclusive subdivision in Antipolo, the name of which she threatened to disclose to the public if the matter goes unresolved by their homeowners’ association.In her post, she talked about a law that supposedly bans karaoke beyond 10 p.m.:“So ito na nga nangyari ito kanina madaling araw 12/20/2017 12:15am ask ko lang po, hindi po ba na may bagong batas ngayon na dapat ang karaoke ay hanggang 10pm lang lalo na sa mga residential area? e yung halos apat hanggang limang dipa lang ang layo sayo ng ingay? pano yon? at halos 12:15 am na dipa sila tapos mag atungal! alam ko magpapasko kaliwat kanan ang party pero sana wag naman abuso sa oras at alamin kung nasa tamang lugar nga ba ang pag iingay. si nanay may sakit di makatulog kasi tapat ng bintana nya ang atungal ng karaoke, ako naman 8months preggy na hirap narin matulog dahil sa kalagayan ko…”Pokwang seems to be referring to House Bill No. 1035 which was filed by a lawmaker in 2016. The bill seeks to ban karaoke from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. to help reduce noise pollution in residential areas. However, the bill was not passed.The comedienne then went on to narrate the confrontation that happened between her helper and her neighbor:“…tapos ng pinakiusapan ni yayey Annie na baka po pwede pakihinaan na po…. ABA!!!! nag wala na si tatang!!! nag sisi sigaw na at ang tapang!! may pagbabanta na!!!! wag daw kami mag papa party kasi babasagin daw nya mga sasakyan ng bisita ko? kelan ako mag pa pa- party? pano? sakalagayan ko ngayon na bed rest? bakit daw kapag kami nag papa shooting di daw sila nag re reklamo! Shooting???? kelan? ah… backpack yon tatang hindi shooting! isang camera lang yon para sa i can do that! at 3pm kami nag start natapos ng bago mag 6pm! na istorbo kana agad sa ganon kaaga? kumpara sa 12:15am na atungal nyo??? ok naka video lahat ng talak mo at pag babanta samin at pagmumura mo sa mga kasambahay ko. merry christmas sayo and goodluck! sasabihin ko soon kung saang EXCLUSIVE SUBDIVISION ito sa Antipolo kapag hindi inayos ito ng HOA president!”Netizens were quick to respond to Pokwang’s post, with a lot of them sharing similar experiences and condemning her noisy neighbors’ rude behavior. Here are some of their comments:What can you say about Pokwang’s complaint about her neighbors? Do you have any suggestions on how to handle neighbors who are still singing karaoke late at night?

Mamamayang mapangabuso sa bayan ni Juan! Yan ang bansag sa mga bagong kabataan ng Unibeesidad ng Pilipinas! Nakakahiya kayo sa bansang sinilangan!”Netizen Harly Bale remarked“Yan ba ang produkto ng tax na binabayad ng taong bayan? Imbes na kung ano anong kalokohan ang gawin nyo tumanaw kayo ng utang na loob sa mga nag papaaral sa inyo sa pamamagitan ng pag babahagi ng inyong natutunan sa kursong napili nyo at tulungan ang bayan na umunlad.” Netizen Paolo Cordero said.“Akala ko UP mga sobrang bait ng mga estudyante..mabuti pa mga pupils ko kahit larawan lang kahit sinong Presidente,respetuhin nila..bakit ganun..nasaan na ba ang tinuturong VALUES EDUCATION sa atin..lalo na kayong taga UP ang talino daw..”MABUTI PANG HINDI MASYADONG MATALINO BASTA MAY RESPETO SA KAPWA TAO”. Teacher Eb-eb Nah Quo said.“Such a disgrace. Never thought that these supposed intellectuals are capable of such a mockery of themselves. If this is the result of freedom, then a dictatorship is beginning to sound appealing to me.” Netizen Jupiter Nacario said.Charles Kevin Absalon said that the reaction of the public on the 2017 lampoon edition of the Philippine Collegian proves how gullible are the Filipinos when it comes on reading satirical and fictional writings.“he said.Last year, Philippine Collegian parodied Mocha Uson in their 2016 lampoon edition.In 2011, a former editor-in-chief of the UP Baguio Outcrop, the official publication of U.P Baguio was charged by libel for its supposedly libelous article against a UPB journalist professor. The Baguio City RTC Branch 6 junked the libel case against the U.P Student in 2016.Commentscomments",

    "body": "The camp of presidential aspirant Rodrigo Duterte pummeled the Liberal Party for depicting the leader as a “threat to democracy” who has been flourishing in the “politics of fear.”Peter Laviña, representative of Duterte, indicated the Liberal Party and the ruling elite class which he said had done only “ensure its own particular advantages,” as the real threats to democracy.“Like whatever is left of the presidential hopefuls who are undermined by a Duterte presidency, (LP leading figure Mar) Roxas and his followers dread they will lose the trappings of that political force they have been hanging on and sticking to for so long,” said Laviña in an announcement.After news broke that Duterte had topped the most recent SWS study — the same overview that set Roxas second to the last — Akbayan partylist Rep. furthermore, LP representative Barry Gutierrezassaulted the leader of Davao and depicted his politics as “politics of fear.”Yet, the announcement, Laviña said, demonstrated how shaken LP had gotten to be by the approaching annihilation of its leading figure Roxas.“It is not democary that is being undermined by Duterte. It is Mar Roxas and his desire to wind up president and the decision class, the same ruling class spoke to by Poe and Binay,” Laviña said. “In any event, these competitors offer visually impaired subjugation to their tip top bosses — something that can’t be anticipated from Duterte.”Laviña said Duterte’s wellspring of bolster originated from the common individuals – farmers, specialists, lower and upper working class and even from a segment of the tip top.”“These are the general population that the camp of Roxas and the other presidential competitors fear — the general population they have incensed and estranged by their uncouth and tip top brand ofinitiative,” said Laviña.Gutierrez, he said, required just to take a gander at his own gathering to realize what has been the genuine risk to vote based system and who has been the purveyor of the legislative issues of apprehension.“Take a look at what this legislature did to the ranchers of North Cotabato? The agriculturists were eager, however as opposed to giving them sustenance, what the Aquino government did was to murder them. That is your danger to vote based system and legislative issues of trepidation, Mr.Gutierrez,” Laviña said.Furthermore, in spite of the case of Gutierrez, Duterte’s image of politics has set the general population at the inside, permitting them to win over their “hopeless lives all in light of the fact that the administration is a disappointment,” he said.“Duterte’s politics is the governmental issues of genuine change and it is not an amazement that thousands and a huge number of Filipinos incline toward this,” Laviña said.Source: INQuirerCommentscomments",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Friday, February 26th, 2016Just as everyone in the Philippine showbiz thought that nothing would make it right between ABS-CBN comedian Vice Ganda and boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, Vice Ganda reaches out to Pacquiao by telephone on Thursday to try to patch things up between the two.In this surprising move, Cristy Cabral, Vice Ganda’s manager contacted Pacquiao by phone and made arrangements for the two celebrities to talk and iron out their differences. Cabral said that it was Vice Ganda’s idea and was surprised when he received a phone call from an emotional Vice Ganda around 3:00AM early Friday morning.“He was difficult to understand, he may have been crying”, said Cabral.Cabral was asked by Vice Ganda to contact Pacquiao that same morning to make plans as soon as possible so the two can meet and put an end to their squabble. He added that he got up early Friday and immediately contacted Pacquiao, who was elated to hear about Vice Ganda reaching out.Plans were immediately made for the two to spend some time in an undisclosed location.However, a reporter at ABS-CBN contacted Pacquiao through a mutual acquaintance and confirmed that Vice Ganda and him had indeed spoken. Pacquiao said that they have made arrangements to meet at the Luneta Park on Tuesday, and agreed to wear neutral matching outfits while they have their talk and walk in the park.They also plan to go to an unnamed exclusive restaurant, where Vice Ganda had planned a quiet dinner for two, prepared by Vice Ganda’s chef-friend.Both will cap the night with a few games of bowling — which is something both surprisingly learned that they both like — and maybe a movie after.Ii was not immediately known if Vice Ganda is picking up Pacquiao or if Pacquiao would just come over to Vice Ganda’s Place.",

    "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte slammed the NPA terrorists for attacking soldiers in humanitarian mission in Samar during his speech in Camp Crame on December 18. He likened them to ISIS terrorists.Loading...Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte condemned the atrocity during his meeting with officials of towns affected by the storm in Naval, Biliran.“(The President) also conveyed that his condemnation of the NPA (New People’s Army) attack on humanitarian soldiers engaged in humanitarian work in Samar, reiterating that this is the reason why he has opted to cease all talks with the NPA,” Roque said.The NPA is the armed wing of the communist rebels. Duterte ended the peace negotiations with the communists last month partly because of the NPA’s extortion activities and attacks against civilians.On Sunday, two soldiers who were on their way to a relief operation in Catubig, Northern Samar were hurt after they were waylaid by NPA members.The injured soldiers were identified as Cpl. Yzazel Laure, who sustained a wound on his belly and Pfc. Roland Gomez, who was hit in the buttocks.In a separate interview, Roque called the NPA and its political arm, the Communist Party of the Philippines, as “traitors.”“It is not only saddening, it does not only make one angry, it proves that the CPP-NPA are traitors,” Roque told radio station dzRH.Roque noted that under the International Humanitarian Law, an attack against a soldier conducting humanitarian activities is considered a war crime.“But that’s our problem with the NPA. They do not fight in accordance with the law. If they fight that way, they cannot be trusted,” the presidential spokesman said.“Pati ‘yung mga sundalo doon sa Samar na tutulong sa mga evacuees niratratan ninyo,” President Duterte said. “That’s why, sabi ko, there is no point in talking to you. There’s not even a single factor of a revolutionary there. You go around asking money, robbing the poor.”“Because kayo mga duwag noon, nakahawak ng baril matapang na ngayon. ‘Yan ang problema diyan sa baril, it gives you extraordinary powers in your mind na hindi ninyo ma-control,” the President said.He added that his direction to the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is to give the NPA no quarters.“No quarters given, no quarters asked. I’m sick and tired of talking to you. Almost pareho kayo ng ISIS,” he said.",

    "body": "• Can she promise the nation that the audit of Aquino’s pork barrel will be finished this year, and not after the 2016 elections?Would Tan stonewall the audit of Aquino’s pork barrel as a quid pro quo for her to be appointed soon as a Supreme Court justice? We hope not.COA must immediately audit Aquino’s pork because it involves a much larger amount of P220 billion, which is eight times the P26 billion pork for 2007-2009.More importantly, Aquino had blatantly used the PDAF and the DAP especially in 2011 and 2012 to bribe first members of the House in filing an impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Renato Corona, and then the senators to convict him.This has been established not only by testimony of those receiving the funds (it was Jinggoy Estrada who exposed it in October 2013), but also by the timing of the funds’ releases. (See my columns: “P559 million released before Senate vote vs. Corona”, Sept. 29, 2013 and “DBM data confirms P100M ‘bribe’ to 16 senators each,” Oct 3. 2013.)Another P4 billion was disbursed to congressmen in 2012, at P15 million each, for having filed the impeachment case against Corona.Think about it. With Aquino bribing congressmen and senators by throwing at them millions of pesos worth of pork barrel funds, would he or his officials have tightened up procedures to make sure that the legislators don’t steal the proceeds, as they had done in 2007-2009?Or, as rumors have circulated, was it Napoles herself and another still unidentified mastermind of the pork barrel scam who helped the legislators, with Aquino’s endorsement, to steal from the pork barrel bribe the president gave them so they’d remove Corona?Was Napoles’ participation in the pork barrel bribes in 2011-2012 the reason for her inexplicable confidence that she would survive her current nightmare, for Aquino to personally see her in Malacañang when she surrendered in August and accompany her to the police headquarters?Or was it an Abad-Napoles tandem in this bigger pork-barrel scam under Aquino? Note that Abad was a congressman for nine years, from 1995 to 2004, who religiously collected his pork barrel that was used for his 16,000 constituents in his tiny province of Batanes.SponsorEspecially since the COA had asked him for documents for its 2007-2009 audit, it is impossible that Abad did not know how people’s money was being stolen through the pork barrel system.Did he advise Aquino that this is the easiest way to bribe Congress so it would remove Corona, and recommended Napoles to help out? Was it this that Napoles was really referring to when she wrote in her sworn statement that it was Abad who taught her how to use NGOs for the pork barrel scam?For all of Aquino’s sickening blah-blahs about “walang mahirap kung walang corrupt,” did he ever talk against the pork barrel system before it was exposed in 2013?Since he, and he alone, directed the use of the DAP, Aquino used these funds as his own personal treasury. Undeniably, Aquino’s hands are tainted with pork barrel money.Note also COA’s wrong priorities to support Aquino’s fake anti-graft campaign.In another move to persecute former President Arroyo as well as to pin down Napoles and the three senators, the COA undertook a special audit of P900 million of the Malampaya funds coursed in 1999 through the agrarian reform department starting in 2011.But what may be compared to the Agrarian reform department’s Malampaya scam is the P8.6 billion—ten times the Malampaya money—Aquino gave to the ARMM from the DAP funds, purportedly to accelerate the region’s development.And how were these distributed? Through Aquino’s hand-picked ARRM Governor Mujiv Hataman who even had a media-covered ceremony distributing P10 million in checks to officials of the region in January 2013. Aquino even complained at that event that Hataman wasn’t disbursing the funds quick enough!For all its posturing as an anti-corruption body, the COA under Tan will be judged by history as another institution prostituted by Aquino, unless she orders the audit of this president’s P220 billion pork barrel, the biggest amount of government money ever put under a president’s sole whim in our history, and the biggest secret of all in this saga.",

Dahil hindi pumapasok sa mga kokote ng mga tsismoso at tsismosa ng ilang kababayan natin. Lilinawin ko lang po uli.1. I AM NOT RUNNING. Hindi ako magpapaligoy ligoy ng sagot. Malinaw ang sagot ko HINDI AKO TATAKBO. Wala ng mas lilinaw pa diyan.2. Hindi ako pulitiko. Alam po niyo yan mga kaDDS. I hate politics and politicians. Ano ba ibig sabihin ko niyan? Ganito lang yan sa pulitika sabi nga nila walang permanenteng kaaway o kaibigan. Bakit? kasi nga balimbingan ng balimbingan diyan. Sa totoo lang diring diri ako sa ganyan. Dahil lang gusto mo ng may kapangyarihan babaluktutin mo prinsipyo mo. GALIT AKO SA GANYAN. At alam naman natin sa Senado napakaraming balimbing diyan. Napakaraming pulitiko diyan. Hindi ba yan ang dahilan ba’t natin binoto si PRRD dahil inis na tayo sa mga TRAPO? Sabi nga nila sa pulitika marunong ka dapat mag laro. Kaya walang nangyayari sa bayan natin dahil diyan sa lintik na kasabihan na yan. Isa pa kung kakandidato ka dapat maging plastik ka sa mga Media at iba’t ibang pulitiko lalo na sa LGU. So paano na mga kabulukan nila at kalokohan nila? Hindi na natin pupunahin dahil kakandidato lang ako? Over my dead body! Itong MUB at mga Pro-Duterte bloggers na nga lang boses natin dahil madami diyang MEDIA naging PR Firm na ng mga pulitiko tapos magiging pulitiko pa po ako?3. Kung tatakbo ako ang aga naman ata ng announcement. Maling mali na mag announce ngayon, bakit? Kasi tatargetin ka ng mga kalaban mo. Lalo na mga dilaw na kandidato. Ang dumi pa naman mag laro ng mga dilawan. Ngayon pa nga lang grabeh na ang paninira nila. Yang bansag na FAKE NEWS na yan? Kahit sila ang madalas mag kamali pero dahil alam nila nakakasira tayong mga DDS sa kanila gagawin nilang manira para hindi lumabas ang baho nila. Ngayon na may ganyang announcement sigurado ako pinaplano na nila lahat ang paninira. Kaka announce pa nga lang inatake na tayo ng mga trolls nila. Basahin niyo po ito- https://goo.gl/F8BWn34. I WILL ONLY RUN IF PRRD WILL TELL ME TO RUNBakit??? Kasi nga DDS ako. Ano ibig sabihin nito? My loyalty is only to him. WALA NG IBA. O hihirit nanaman yung mga dilaw dapat sa taumbayan ang loyalty mo. Common sense po lang, ang ibig sabihin ko ng “my loyalty is only to him” ay pagdating sa mga nasa gobyerno o polticians not pertaining to people. Siyempre I am here to serve the Filipino people. Given na yan pero pag dating sa mga boss wala na akong ibang boss kung hindi si PRRD. Siya susundin ko dahil sa kanya lang ako may tiwala na may tunay na malasakit sa mga Pilipino. Yung iba? ewan ko lang. If I will run dahil gusto ko lang mapabilis na mapasa ang mga programa gusto niya para sa taumbayan. Sa totoo lang kaya bumabagal ang pag unlad ng Pilipinas hindi na dahil kay PRRD dahil yan sa napakabagal na pagpapasa ng mga batas na kailangan ng Pangulo. Halimbawa nalang DEATH PENALTY??? Anong petsa na? Ilang RAPE incident pa ba ang gusto nating mapanood sa news? Pangalawa EMERGENCY POWERS ng DOTr? Panay sisi na lang tayo sa DOTr? pero ang totoo hindi sapat ang kapangyarihan nila.Bakit ba tumatagal? kasi yung “ilang” mambabatas natin kesa na yan ang asikasuhin namumulitika at nagpapakyut lang dahil kakandidato sa 2019. Kaya ito ang sagot ko wala ng paliguy ligoy pa- tatakbo lang ako dahil gusto ng Pangulo mapabilis ang kanyang plano para sa bayan.5. Huli sa lahat mga kaDDS. Para lang sa kaalaman ninyo gusto ko nang mag quit sa pulitika as soon as possible. After PRRD gusto ko nang maging pribado muli. Nandito lang po ako dahil gusto ko po makita na maisakatuparan ang mga pinangako ni PRRD noong nakaraang eleksyon. Since nakilala na po natin ang Pangulo at ang ilang mga gabinete ay gusto ko lang ipagpatuloy ihatid ang mga hinaing ng mga Pilipino sa kanila. YAN LANG ANG DAHILAN BAKIT AKO NAG PAPATULOY. Wala ng iba. Sa totoo lang nakakapagod na po. Habang nagtratrabaho po tayo hindi tumitigil ang kaaway ng bayan mang bash, kahit itong basurang Rappler na ito parang stalker na. Nag aabang ng pagkakamali tapos ibabalita. Kahit mga maliliit ng mali. Yun nga misquote ng THE MANILA TIMES sa akin pa sinisi.Alam niyo mga kaDDS nakakalungkot dahil lahat ng gagawin natin ngayon ay siguradong kukulayan ng mga opposition dahil dito. Sa mga masugid pong nagbabasa ng MOCHA USON BLOG kilala niyo po ako. Galit ako sa TRAPO, EPALITIKO at higit sa lahat GALIT AKO SA MGA PLASTIK na pulitiko. Sabi nila madumi daw ang showbiz world pero mas marumi di hamak ang pulitika. Kaya yan ang pinaka huling papasukin natin. Hangga’t maari dito nalang tayo sa pagsisilbi sa ating Pangulo sa Executive Branch at after this balik pribado na tayo. Sa totoo lang gusto ko na mag quit ngayon palang. Kung hindi lang dahil sa pang-aapi ng ilang media at mababang tingin ng ilang opisyal ng gobyerno sa mga DDS at pro-Duterte bloggers ay titigil na tayo. Gusto ko din maging bukas ang impormasyon para sa lahat hindi lang sa traditional media. Yan ang aking mission bilang ASEC.Sana po naliwanagan na ang ilang mga kaDDS natin. Tuloy ang laban para sa ating bayan at para sa ating Pangulo!",

    "body": "A blogger claimed at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas paid an influencer to insulate him from backlash over the 2015 Mamasapano encounter, an allegation that Sen. Grace Poe dismissed as hearsay.Rey Joseph Nieto of political blog Thinking Pinoy alleged that Roxas paid to get the hashtag \"NasaanAngPangulo\" (where is the president) to trend at the height of the Mamasapano clash, an issue that is still hurled against the Aquino administration more than two years later.Nieto, citing a source, said a certain Joyce Ramirez made the hashtag, which refers to president Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III and his perceived absence in the aftermath of the clash, a trending topic.\"The #NasaanAngPangulo campaign, based on the information that I got, is a campaign that's intended to pin down all the blame over the Mamasapano incident on former President Aquino apparently so that if Mar runs for the presidency he can be shielded from the bad PR,\" Nieto claimed.Roxas, whose department is supposed to have administrative control over the Philippine National Police, had not been briefed on the covert Special Action Force operation against international terrorists in Mamasapano, Maguindanao.He chose to stay on the Aquino Cabinet in the aftermath of the encounter between SAF and armed groups in the area that killed around 60 Filipinos. He also lost the elections.The hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo trended on Twitter in 2015 after netizens wondered where Aquino was during the welcome honors for the slain Special Action Force members. Aquino reportedly went to the inauguration of a Mitsubishi plant in Sta Rosa, Laguna instead.Poe, chair of the Senate committee on Public Information and Mass Media that was holding a hearing on fake news on Wednesday, said Nieto’s allegations against Roxas are \"controversial and strong.\" Poe, who ran against Roxas in the 2016 elections, said Nieto's claims are hearsay unless he can prove them.'Nieto's claims irresponsible, malicious'Former presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda, who was also at the hearing, decried Nieto’s claims saying he should not make such \"irresponsible and very malicious\" allegations at the Senate.\"It's a very offensive allegation made by Mr. Nieto here—an allegation that has no basis,\" Lacierda said.Lacierda defended the previous administration and denied Nieto's claims saying the officials were present then the remains of the SAF 44 — the name for the commandos killed in the clash — but that Aquino chose to skip the heroes’ welcome as \"he wanted the family members to spend time amongst themselves.\"Nieto claimed that he has a document that he said came from Ramirez and that listed the #NasaanAngPangulo campaign as one of her accomplishments. He added that Ramirez used the document to advertise herself to political camps during the election campaign.The Senate panel asked Nieto to provide the documents pertaining to his allegations.SilentNoMorePH 'expose'Nieto was at the Senate for a hearing on \"fake news\" that was prompted by very public protestations from seven senators who claimed to have been targeted by SilentNoMorePH, a blog and Facebook group, for not signing a resolution calling on the government to put a stop to killings, especially of teenagers.The senators said it was malicious to claim they had refused to sign the resolution when they had no chance to do so.Nieto claimed that a certain Edward Angelo \"Cocoy\" Dayao is behind SilentNoMorePH and around 20 other websites based on the sites using the same Google AdSense publisher ID. He asked for blanket immunity from suit in exchange for giving senators the list of websites. Senators did not take him up on the offer.Aside from the yet unsubstantiated allegation against Roxas, Nieto also mentioned the supposed \"Lenileaks\" controversy from earlier this year. The controversy involves supposed emails by people from the Office of the Vice President discussing destabilization of the Duterte administration.Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in January that the Palace would have the supposed plot investigated.\"We will see. I don’t want to jump the gun. I don’t want to be judgmental. It is under investigation. We will do everything to solve this matter,\" he said.",

    "body": "A patient being carried out of an ambulance was accidentally dropped to the ground by hospital staff. The incident was caught on the CCTV of a hospital in Surigao del Norte.Apparently, the safety belt on the stretcher the patient was being carried on was not properly strapped in and that the wheel of the stretcher were locked which caused the patient's body to tilt to the side and completely fell to the ground.The patient was declared dead on arrival but his wife speculates that the mishandling of the hospital staff that caused his husband to fall might have had greatly contributed to her husband's death. She also said that she could still hear him snoring on the way to the hospital and firmly believes that if he hadn't fall from the stretcher, he may still be alive right now. On the other hand, the doctor who attended the patient said he was already dead because of heart attack.The hospital also pointed out that the family of the patient breached the emergency protocol by bringing another person board the ambulance instead of having just the wife to go with the patient. That other person, who happens to be a nurse, was said to have tried to interfere with the staff by kicking the stretcher wheel that won't unlock.The patient's cousin said in defense that rescuers specifically asked for her help.\"Yung rescuer humingi ng tulong na sipain 'yung gulong kasi hindi nila maiangat yung lock ng gulong ng stretcher. Yung stretcher din kasi nila may depekto.\", the patient's cousin said.The hospital also suggests that the family edited the CCTV video and that they are just using their predicament for monetary gains.Meanwhile, the Surigao City Emergency Rescue Services remains mum on the issue.Watch the video report of the incident below:Here's the full copy of the CCTV footage posted by the victim's relative on social media:",

Officials have opened an investigation into the spill.Kuwait said American oil firm Chevron Corp. and containment specialists Oil Spill Response Ltd. were helping in the cleanup. (The Associated Press)“There will be severe consequences to those responsible for this incident, and we will prosecute them,” Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family who is head of the Environment Public Authority, told The Associated Press.He urged residents to keep away from affected areas, which lie north of a private beach and resort area called al-Khiran where many Kuwaitis spend most of the summer in beach houses.Boats and crews have been putting booms into the water to try and contain the spill. Officials want to protect waterways, power plants and water facilities first, then clean surrounding beaches, according to a report on the state-run KUNA news agency.Khaled al-Hajeri, the president of Kuwait’s Green Line Society, said the environmental non-profit organization holds the government responsible for any damage or health effects of the spill.Kuwait failed to warn public“The government failed to issue a statement communicating the severity of this disaster. There was no warning people against fishing or entering the polluted area, even though it is close to some of the most popular summer destinations in Kuwait,” he told the AP. “This is what happens when under-qualified individuals handle the government’s most sensitive environment entity.”Al-Hajeri said the spill began days ago and that activists from his group informed authorities about it on Aug. 10.“This media blackout is intentional and wrong. People have the right to know. This will have an impact on the fish, the food people consume, and it directly affects their health and safety,” he added.Chevron helping with cleanupAuthorities in neighbouring Saudi Arabia have put an emergency action plan into effect to deal with the spill and were conducting an aerial survey of the area, according to a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.The joint operations centre in the Saudi border town of Khafji said facilities there have not been affected by the spill.Kuwait said American oil firm Chevron Corp. and containment specialists Oil Spill Response Ltd. were helping in the cleanup. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., operates fields on both sides of the border. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The area in Kuwait is home to the oil and natural gas fields shared by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Some of those fields famously were set ablaze by Iraqi forces retreating from a U.S.-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War that ended Saddam Hussein’s occupation of the country.Tiny Kuwait, an OPEC member nation, has the world’s six-largest estimated oil reserves.",

Grace Poe, revealed that P1.2 Billion of Yolanda funds was paid to at least 36 celebrity endorsers of presidential bet Mar Roxas.On thursday, a congressman from Negros Occidental told local radio station DYLR Bacolod, that one of the reasons why he resigned from the party is the “lavish spending of people’s money”.Our local politicians who needed funds for their campaign were left behind because the party had prioritized Mar and Leni. The overspending on useless celebrity endorsements is just unacceptable”, the solon said.Mar Roxas said celebrities who endorsed his candicacy are not paid and they are doing it voluntarily, but veteran showbiz talkshow host and reporter Cristy Fermin rebutted the claim, saying celebrities are paid as much as 20 million. Fermin cites Kathryn Bernardo as an example, who allegedly received 20 million – a move that allegedly angered INC that led to her expulsion from the powerful religious group.Roxas celebrity endorsers includes mainly from ABS-CBN talents headed by Kris Aquino, Daniel Padilla, Kathryn Bernardo, Karla Abellana and Ruffa Mae Quinto among others.We had no problem helping Mar. The problem is, we are spending people’s money that was intended for Yolanda victims, and we, here in Visayas cannot just tolerate”, the congressman said.Source: newsinfolearn.comCommentscomments",

I saw the shit they built and when I saw those hovels, the first words out of my mouth were, “You have got to be fucking kidding me..”, endless shaking of head. Shake shake shake.“Hovels that were a little bit wider than one arms’ length and maybe, at most 2 arms’ length at its widest with paper thin plyboards between each unit.“My dogs live so much more luxuriously.“Something that most of us will not be able to live in for one night, they lived in for over 3 yrs.“And just like that. JUST LIKE THAT. And because the president ordered it. The poor, the grieving, the beaten down and defeated have been given a leg up.“The president visited them earlier this month and he saw the same shit others (me included) saw and it grieved him. And this is where he provided the muscle needed to get our kababayans out of the nightmare they were in for the past 3 yrs.“The poor cannot tolerate setbacks as much as we, who are a bit better off, can.“One illness in the family, a typhoon that destroys their homes, takes their livelihoods away- can send them into a downward spin they can’t get out of. And this is where generational poverty starts. It’s just too hard for them to get out of this vicious trap. They need our help—over and beyond what most of us need.“And I hear that on top of these homes, transportation to and from school for the children will be provided for. And then of course, there’s the rice subsidy on top of the conditional cash transfer they will get. And I hear public school kids are going to be given carabao milk every day. In this place where I see so much malnourished children and where children who go to school hungry, day in, day out.“I could cry. Really I could–from this man’s kindness. And how his heart is so clearly for the poor and how he serves them in all ways.“The kind of service I have not seen for the poor from a sitting president in a very long time.“And so today I learned the most powerful man in our country has reached out and given his hand to some of our least powerful.“And today I learned that so much of what I ached for for the people of Samar and Leyte will finally come to pass.“Today is a good day, my friends.“I hug you guys.

The headline backed by a video as a proof that the story is true has been making the rounds in social media since it was posted on February of this year.However, there is no mention of such incident in the mainstream media prompting the wiser folk to question the authenticity of the story. Further digging by our team who specializes in scandalous news which is by the way composed two male volunteers who regularly scour the internet for scandals (for science, of course), also revealed that the woman in the video did not speak Tagalog.As the editor of this site, I have to tell my two volunteers that a woman not speaking Tagalog is enough proof that she is not a Filipina. But these guys insist that 90 percent of the time, they are absolutely right when they say a woman in a video is not Pinay.As I was confused, I just went along with them. The woman did not speak Tagalog or a Filipino dialect that I know of but she looks like one of my chinita friends. But then again, Indonesians and Malaysians also looks like us Pinoys. The real identity of the people involved simply cannot be verified as there is no credible source.Anyway, let's hope that she's not sentenced to death for having a video like this. As for the three Mr. Swabe looking guys in the said footage, they looked happy and the one in blue shirt is thirsty as fvck.We should think of this as a hoax until further solid proof surfaces.",

She seemed worried in the said video as she calls out to her mother from her room where she and others including a baby stayed as CIDG storms the Parojinog residences.After the live stream of Naja Parojinog, granddaughter to Ozamiz mayor who was killed in that pre-dawn raid, a copy of it was automatically saved to her FB account where it was soon discovered by netizens after news of the incident broke on both mainstream and social media.Users of the said social media network had differing comments and opinions on the short footage with some pointing out that it was not the appropriate time to stream live videos on social media while your kith and kin were being killed in a firefight just meters from your room.Others defended the vice mayor's daughter's action by pointing out that it was understandable that she took a live video in such a frightening situation to document the incident as many would have done so too and that it could help other people understand what really went down during the raid.Alas, the video doesn't seem to have much in it that can offer more insights to what went down during the incident other than the fact that there's at least one child, a baby, in one of the houses who fortunately survived the clash.Watchbelow:",

Para sa akin, hindi naman big deal kung iimbitahan ako o hindi. Nakakawalang gana na lang doon iyong manner kung paano ginagawa ang mga bagay,” she said.“Kasi kung galit sa akin, galit sa akin. Pero sana bigyan naman nang kaunting respeto ang opisina.Pero ang sa akin, okay naman iyon,” the Vice President added.Robredo’s spokesperson earlier said the Office of the Vice President received an invitation to the Vin d’honneur via e-mail on December 28, 2016 but Malacañang called on Jan. 4 to retract it, saying the guest list was limited.The Vice President said she had readily expressed her intention to attend the social event when her chief of staff staff informed her of the invitation last year.“Tumawag sa akin ang aking Chief of Staff, sinasabi niya na mayroon tayong imbitasyon, mag-aattend ka ba? Sabi ko sige, kung inimbitahan tayo, mag-aattend tayo,” she said.In Malacañang’s defense, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said it was the Palace’s prerogative to choose who would be on the guest list.The relationship between Duterte and Robredo reached a new low point after the President accused her of joining rallies calling for her ouster.Duterte said Robredo’s association with parties allegedly planning to unseat him was a reason why he didn’t want her to be part of his Cabinet anymore.The Vice President resigned as chair of the Housing and Urban Development and Coordinating Council in the early part of December 2016 after being told to stop attending Cabinet meetings.",

However, she mistakenly called her current beau James, realizing that she needs to end things with Joshua – finally cut all ties with her former lover.Her hugot jokes and witty one-liners on breaking up and moving on were a sure hit with the audience and judges alike throughout the contest run, besting other contenders. Indeed, she laughed all the way to the bank, after taking home the Php1 million-prize money.Speaking to ABS-CBN News and PUSH, the aspiring comedienne shared her inspiration behind the hugot jokes.“True-to-life stories po siya ng mga friends ko (laughs). Somehow may hugot din po ako pero mas malala ang hugot ng friends ko,” she quipped.And who exactly are James and Joshua – the undeniable stars of her monologues?“Si James po talaga ay representation lang ng ex ng sambayanang Pilipino kaya siguro nakaka-relate sila kasi feeling ko may ganun po sila,” she explained.“Si Joshua naman po ay representation din po. Wala po si Joshua sa totoong buhay (laughs),” Donna added.After winning the competition, Donna will set aside a portion of her winnings for her siblings’ studies. But more importantly, she wants to her mother to come home from abroad, saying, “First plan ko po ay pauwiin na si mama na OFW sa Lebanon po. The rest bahala na muna.”So, what does it feel to become an instant celebrity after her hilarious performance?She shared:“Eto po marami ng nakakakilala at masaya rin po ako na nabigyan muli ng chance na makapag-perform sa TV,” “Meron po sa jeep. Nagko-commute pa rin kasi ako, naka-upo ako doon sa likod ng driver and then nakita niya ako. Habang umaandar kami gusto niya mag-selfie, eh. Medyo malayo po ako sa kanya tapos pinapahinto niya ang driver… Nag-smile naman po ako pero alam ko blurred yung picture namin (laughs).”Prior to her Funny One stint, Donna was an extra in the primetime series, “Forevermore”. In fact, she had one scene with the show’s star, Liza Soberano.“Nag-talent po ako noon sa Forevermore kasi po sa Baguio po sila. Ako po doon yung assistant ng character ni Miss Tess na napag-utusan, nagkamali, tapos inaway,” she recounted.Did you watch Donna Cariaga ‘s final performance on the noontime show? What could you say about her hugot jokes? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.",

    "body": "TIME magazine, a one-trick pony in blinkers, should be the last place investors go to get their information and The VolatilianTM is fairly sure it is; after all, this once-over-lightly American news weekly has never been accused of being a serious commentator on the world’s financial markets or its economies, any more than its been accused of being an example of balanced reporting. Its latest attack on the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, illustrates the reasons for both.Lets look at the headline, ‘Philippine Equities Plunge…’ suggesting that there was a massive sell-off across the board at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). The article was based on a note put out by Bloomberg Markets (a reliable commentator); its headline was ‘Duterte’s Stock Rally Withers…’. In other words, it wasn’t a plunge in stocks at all; no alarm triggers were going off at the PSE. It was a rally that had withered – not exactly an unusual event in market behaviour.And, of course, in the body of the story the treatment was also very different. While Bloomberg attributed the market’s earlier rise – reaching a 15-month high – to Duterte’s election victory, noting that the market was still up by 12% on the year, and that the Philippine peso had its best performance of any Asian currency in August, TIME ignored all this. Instead, it used the Bloomberg note – which it evidently didn’t understand – as a lead-in to fire broadsides at, quote, “pugnacious President Rodrigo Duterte” who apparently, quote, “is expected to defend his murderous war on drugs to US President Barack Obama”. Quite what that had to do with the story, frankly, is baffling. Certainly, Bloomberg didn’t find it necessary to include it in the original story about stock movements.But here’s a little actual, factual background. This year, foreign investors have ploughed US$1.3 billion into the PSE – much of that since the results of the election were announced at the beginning of May. Over the past three months, US$248 million has been withdrawn from the market – that was the point of the Bloomberg note. Some part of that, however, is likely to be from the US$451 million foreign-portfolio investments (FPIs) which flooded into the country in June; Hot money – investors warm to Duterte. A full 83.8% of those investments ended up in the PSE. By their nature FPIs are speculative; they don’t reside long wherever they go. They are a fast hit for a fast return.Leaving aside the stock market, more relevantly, US$8.51 billion found its way into the Philippines in the first half of this year.TIME magazine, it has to be remembered, is another pampered barking dog of Washington’s Left elite. Its current managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, is an Obama sycophant – he’s her “Prince” apparently – who eulogises all things liberal; her predecessor, Richard Stengel, is now at the US State Department. He was appointed by Obama as Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Right, we’ve wasted enough time on TIME but we’re sure you get the point.The Volatilian™ is not a stock-market gazer. Stock-market performances, while important, are not a crystal-ball reading of the overall health or vibrancy of a country’s macro economy. They can show investor sentiment in a country to some degree, but investor actions in a market are determined by a complex matrix of influences. Global and regional pressures – political, economic; even climatic – central-bank decision-making (actual or perceived), as well as hedging and balancing portfolios across markets and across sectors are just a few of the considerations the big movers of money have to deal with.That said, it’s worth noting that historic data show that the PSE has a habit of performing strongly in the second year of a presidential term – for President Fidel V. Ramos it leapt up by 116% in year two of his administration, for President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino, 36%, for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 32%; for President Joseph Estrada, 15%.The anti-Duterte static being created by the media camarilla and their fellow travellers in the cabal of NGOs needs to be ignored; the Philippines’ economic potential is as great – if not greater – than it has ever been.What’s happening, right now, across the 300,000 square kilometres on which this island nation stands – investors take note – is a new chapter in nation building; a reuniting of the society that will allow its true potential as an industrious, savvy and entrepreneurial people to be realised. That is at the core of this administration’s purpose.Right now, the Philippines is in transition as it moves to a socio-economic model. This is the new normal which international investors need to get their head around if they are going to trade successfully and profitably in this market. Those that miss this picture could miss the boat.What also needs to be understood is that there are a number of large legacy problems which are being tackled simultaneously – not least among these, a neglected agricultural sector, a duopoly-controlled telco sector, and a grid-locked transport sector; all historically under funded and hobbled by decades of piecemeal development and conflicted planning polices.Duterte and his Cabinet are not sugar-coating these problems – the reverse; they are bringing them, finally, into the light and tackling them with an energy that has rarely been seen from public servants in this country. The VolatilianTM gets reports regularly of department secretaries in the field seeing the problems first hand, not relying on questionable and often finessed data from somewhere down the line. That fact alone should give investors confidence that the ship of the Philippine economy – rough though the waters are just now – is in the hands of a dedicated crew.There is little doubt that the two-month-long crackdown on the Philippine mining sector, being carried out via a Department of the Environment and Natural Resources review of the industry, has worried investors. The downward trend in the prices in Philippine mining stocks clearly shows that. Similarly – though to a lesser extent – the decision by the government’s casino regulator, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, to ban online gaming by reason of its inability to collect taxes from companies operating in this sector, hit the share price of a couple of listed firms hard. Given better regulation, though, and removing the cowboy element from them, will eventually allow water to find its own level in these sectors.Meanwhile, one of the long-term goals of this administration is to reconfigure the country as a federation of states (possibly 11 of them); each commercially autonomous. The Philippine Federation – the shape of things to come. Separately, they will be able to set their own economic agendas, develop their own industries and be free to attract foreign direct investment – but on terms set by them, not by the bureaucratic and corporate interests back in Manila. This, The Volatilian™ believes, will amount to an Open Doors policy in which the states will vie with each other to gain competitive advantage in attracting inward investment. Free market all the way.Foreign investors are not squeamish. Hundreds of billions of dollars are moved through the world’s capital-markets each day. Crisis – as elements of the media would have us believe the Philippines is experiencing – is part of their world. In Chinese, the word is spoken as two characters: wei (danger), ji (opportunity), and that’s a language they understand.But this is a journey which at times – like now – will pass through volatile territory; parts of it will be easy, others treacherous, much of it unchartered. And the last thing any foreign investor needs on this trip is a map printed by TIME.",

But Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, warned that ‘potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s’ for much of the West, including the US and UK.NUMBER ONE FOR 142 YEARS: HOW THE U.S. OVERTOOK BRITAIN AS THE WORLD’S ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE IN 1872Britain led the world in the industrial revolution of the mid-18th century, but America was hot on its heels. The US underwent huge industrial expansion after its civil war ended in 1865, fuelled by rapid urbanisation and huge population growth – including the immigration of nearly 30million Europeans. In 1872, its economy overtook Britain to become the world’s largest, a position it held for the next 142 years. Productivity, leading brands and innovation, coupled with the success of the US dollar and the fact that 62 per cent of the world’s financial reserves are held in the currency, kept America on top. Meanwhile, the economies of Britain and other European powers were ravaged by two world wars. Britain borrowed heavily from America during the Second World War and received a further $4.3billion in 1945. China was the world’s leading trading nation up to the 18th century, until control of its ports and trade were taken over by imperial nations in Europe. Under Communism it remained inward-looking, until 1980 when the government started to allow foreign investment. He added that China is ‘maintaining high growth’ which will slow in the coming years to a more ‘healthy’ level between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Arvind Subramanian, senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute and an expert on China, recently highlighted the ‘symbolic’ importance of China overtaking the US. ‘China is very big and getting bigger,’ he said. ‘It’s not to be underestimated.’ The news that China is now the largest economy in the world is an embarrassment for Barack Obama and ends America’s 142 years at the top. Britain had out-produced the US and its European rivals for much of the 19th century, at the height of the industrial revolution and with trade links across the Empire. But the US caught up as a growing population, the expansion of the railways and a focus on industry as well as agriculture boosted its economy. source: dailynews UKCommentscomments",

    "body": "The shape of the proposed ‘Federation of Philippine States’ and the means of creating it are now becoming clearer as a working timetable is being been laid out to drive the republic from a unitary to a federal system of government.Here’s what we know. Necessary changes to the 1987 Constitution will be effected by means of a Constituent Assembly and not, as was widely suggested, by a Constitutional Convention. This is an alternative option provided by the constitution to allow revisions to the charter. Three quarters of sitting lawmakers will be needed to makes the changes effective.The reason for this move is that Constitutional Conventions – the Philippines has held five; the first in 1897 – are timely, costly and unwieldy. They require the nationwide election of delegates: a long drawn-out process which would run up a bill of several billion pesos. By contrast, a Constituent Assembly can be formed by convening and realigning the existing Congress as a dedicated body for the specific and exclusive purpose of discussing charter change in the context of establishing a Philippine Federation.In other words, the opportunity of it becoming a free-for-all talking shop on every fringe issue and for every personal and party agenda item that lawmakers might want to bring up in relation to broader political and economic business/reform can be averted. Economics, logistics, expediency and the need to maintain focus solely on the matter of creating a federal Philippines, form the argument for not going the Constitutional Convention route.Both methods, however, require ratification by the people through a plebiscite.With regards to how the federation is composed, while this is one of the main issues which the assembly will tackle, the general feeling seems to be that there should be 11 or 12 states, possibly 11 federal and one federal administrative region. The Union of Philippine Federal StatesWhile geography will largely determine the states’ formations with areas of close proximity allowing natural state borders, economics are also likely to play a part with lower-income areas being grouped with wealthier ones. Similarly, issues of language (dialect), religion and tribal culture will also be taken into account.In 2008, Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr proposed a federation of the following states, each with its own capital: Northern Luzon (Tuguegarao City), Central Luzon (Tarlac City), Southern Tagalog (Tagaytay City), Mimaropa (Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro), Bicol (Legazpi City), Eastern Visayas (Catbalogan City), Central Visayas (Cebu City), Western Visayas (Iloilo City), Northern Mindanao (Cagayan de Oro City), Southern Mindanao (Davao City), Bangsamoro (Marawi City). Metro Manila would be the Federal Administrative Region with Manila as its capital.While this may not be the final outcome, it’s likely to provide a starting point for the discussions on how the states will be configured. Other proposals include a three-state structure based on the main island groups of Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. This, however, we can dismiss as it would prevent anything but the broadest representation of federal government – the wide ranging cultural and religious divisions in Mindanao, for example, would never be able to flourish in their own right.Finally, timing. While charter change was not a priority of the previous government – much less was any notion of federalism – the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has moved it to the top of its reform agenda.It’s understood that a Constituent Assembly would need a full year to debate and then make the necessary constitutional changes, allowing the proposals to then be put before the electorate in a referendum. For reasons of logistics and cost-efficiency, this is most likely to take place during the 2019 midterm elections when the people go to the polls for the three-yearly congressional elections. And if it is the people’s will that their country should transition to the Philippine Federation, that will be the basis of the 2022 national elections.Viewed like that it would seem there is plenty of time to get everything in order. But while forming the assembly and holding the referendum will take no time at all, given the time it traditionally takes for legislators to get through their business – and often business far less contentious and far reaching than this – the estimate that it can be conducted and concluded within one year seems optimistic.",

    "body": "Ito ang hinaing at reklamo ng isang consumer ng meralco, dahil sa bagal ng emergency response nito, basahin ang kanyang complain kung nakaranas rin ba kayo ng ganitong pangyayari o magkatulad na sitwasyon kung saan emergency at kailangan nyo ng tulong mula sa technical side ng meralco.So disappointed with how Meralco handled my complaint last nightAround 1030PM, i was having my normal night. it was breezy that time when suddenly i heard an explosion outside my house and saw electrical wires sparkling like firecrackers..I immediately called their call center for assistance. I explained to them what happened and from that moment the sparkling was still there.. afraid that something worse might happen i sought immediate assistance and told them to consider it an emergency. they told me that they will provide me help within 2-4 hours. 2-4 hours is like an eternity when you’re worried and anxious.. and it was an EMERGENCY… but of course i gave them the benefit of the doubt. It was their standard operating procedure. It was their protocol (yes, even if it’s emergency)So Within the 4 hour period, i made around like 20 follow-ups so that they can give me special attention and consideration.. But to no avail. They even dropped several of my calls because my calls went from simple to demanding coz ive waited long enough.It was 430AM, 6hrs had passed, 2 hours more of what is expected. Being a KOI ENTHUSIAST, ive maintained 3 ponds at home.. these special beings like we do need oxygen to breathe.. aerators run by electricity is a must in order for them to live.. like human beings, they cant live without air.. there’s this time frame that without these aerators, these lovely beings will die..During this time, saw most of the koi gasping for air. They were like pitted in a gas chamber clinging for dear life.. saw one, two, three, four dying then dead until their number went limitless.. BLACKOUT is a thing of a past so generators nowadays is not a necessity anymore until now.Made follow up calls every 5 minutes. My complaint was no longer just the danger of fire but the survival of hundreds of my beloved koisMy exact words were, “SIR/MADAM 6-7 HOURS NA AKONG NAGHIHINTAY MGA 100 na FOLLOW UPs na nagawa ko sa inyo hanggang ngayon wala pa rin.. NAG-AALAGA AKO NG MGA ISDA 7 ORAS NA SILANG WALANG OXYGEN ANG DAMI NANG NAMAMATAY, puwede bang kausapin ko na yung talagang pupunta dito dahil pag wala pa kayong ginawa lahat ng isda ko dito mamamatay”.They retorted, “sorry sir wala pa po yung mag-aassist sa inyo”What 7 hours na wala pa rin at di nyo parin alam kung sinong mag-aassist sa akin? Nakakagigil na. (Only in the Philippines)Around 615AM, 8 hours after i made a complaint, they finally arrived.. they were like policemen on movies who came late for help.. i went down to talk to a head lineman..ME – kuya 1030PM ako tumawag sa inyo sinabi ng call center 2-4 hours, anong oras na? 8 hours na akong naghihintay hanggang ngayon yung wires nagsspark pa… paano kung yung wires e malapit sa bahay ko? E di nasunog bahay ko? Hihintayin nyo pa bang nasusunog ang bahay bago kayo umaksyon? ganyan ba kayo magrespond sa emergency? Tignan mo kuya more than 200 ang isda kong namatay na matagal ko nang inaalagaan.. Pano kung tao yan papabayaan nyo nalang mamatay?HEAD LINEMAN- sir, sa totoo lang yung request nyo po e nirelay ng call center sa amin around 545AM.. nasa call center po ang problema.. kami po yung nakatoka sa area nyo kagabi wala naman pong tawag sa amin.. nakastandby nga lang po kami at wala kaming ginagawa pero yung request po 545AM lang dumatingME – kuya more than 100 calls ang ginawa ko sa center nyo tapos sasabihin mo sa akin 545AM nyo lang nareceive?LINEMAN – opo sir. Eto po tignan nyo sa phone call. Sisihin nyo po yung call centerI dont normally do this..Im a person who remains calm and silent despite of adversities. Im a very private personBut if it will teach people some lessons in life, will let social media do the talking…Pag ganyan, talagang di na tayo uunlad at aasensoSo sad lang, that despite of what happened, people will always put a blame on other people..So who will be accountable? Neither because the damage has been done and you have to move forwardAnd If it’s not their life, wala silang pakialam sa sayo…Just saying – from Redford Lacanilao#MADILIMSAMERALCO",

With their undeniable chemistry, it’s hard to see how the pair can resist each other. These rumors continue to spread when they were spotted vacationing in Boracay together, where many fans commented on how much of a gentleman Daniel seemed to be as he was never far from Kathryn. In fact, it’s this caring characteristic that the brooding, bad boy-lite Daniel is known for.One evidence of this is seen in how the Teen King seems to be bothered by something while doing an interview for YES! Magazine’s 100 Most Beautiful Stars press conference. He was seen looking at Kathryn’s chest and then leaning towards the Teen Queen, presumably to whisper something to her. After which Kathryn immediately pulled up the front of her gown.",

    "body": "The saying 'people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones' is very appropriate for former President Fidel V. Ramos who fired the first salvo against President Rody Duterte. His criticism of Duterte's first 100 days has opened his own track record to scrutiny. As it turns out, he has a number of issues against him.This is a very interesting read mostly taken from Wikipedia. Do your own research because there seems to be a lot more to be uncovered.Clark Centennial Expo ScandalSupposedly, one of his notable contributions to the Philippines was the revival of nationalistic spirit by embarking on a massive promotion campaign for the centennial of Philippine Independence celebrated on June 12, 1998.However, charges of alleged massive corruption or misuse of funds blemished the resulting programs and various projects, one of which was the Centennial Expo and Amphitheater at the former Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Pampanga, supposedly Ramos' pet project.The commemorative projects, particularly those undertaken at the former Clark Air Base, were hounded by illegal electioneering and corruption controversies even years after the Centennial celebrations. A special report by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) showed how the projects relating to the Expo site not only revealed the extravagance and inefficiency of the administration, but also served as convenient vehicle to effect election fund-raising for the LAKAS political party of Ramos at the expense of the tax-paying Filipinos and in violation of the Election Code.The Centennial Expo Pilipino project, intended to be the centerpiece for the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the country's independence from Spain, also earned extensive criticisms for being an expensive white elephant project that disadvantaged the government at the cost of P9 billion, or 1.7 percent of the country's 1998 national budget.Six ranking Ramos cabinet members and officials, headed by Chairman Salvador Laurel (former Vice-President) of the Centennial Commission were cleared by the Ombudsman and Sandigan Bayan (People's Court). Ramos appeared before a Congressional Committee in October 1998 to help exonerate said officials of any wrongdoing.PEA-Amari ScandalPresident Fidel Ramos was accused of corruption in the PEA-Amari deal. The controversial deal involved the acquisition of 158 hectares of reclaimed land on Manila Bay that was to be converted into so-called Freedom Islands. The deal was forged in April 1995 as part of the Ramos administration's Manila Bay Master Development Plan (MBMDP).The PEA-Amari deal – in addition to other projects in Manila Bay - displaced over 3,000 fishing and coastal families in Manila Bay just to give way to what fisherfolk activists from Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) described as \"an immoral, illegal and grossly unconstitutional state venture\".Ramos denied accusations that the PEA-Amari deal was clinched to benefit members of the ruling Lakas-NUCD as alleged by opposition groups. However, ex- solicitor general Franciso Chavez filed a petition to nullify the PEA-Amari deal because the government stood to lose billions of pesos in the sale of reclaimed lands to Amari.On April 25, 1995, PEA entered into a joint venture with Amari to develop Freedom Islands and on June 8 of the same year, Ramos okayed deal. On November 29, 1996, then-Senate President Ernesto Maceda delivered a privilege speech assailing the deal as the \"grandmother of all scams\".Role in EDSA 2 ouster of President Joseph EstradaA longstanding criticism of Ramos was whether his role in the Estrada ouster was motivated by his fear of being prosecuted in connection with the Centennial Expo and other scams.When Estrada was given executive clemency after having been found guilty of plunder by the special Sandiganbayan court in September 2007,Ramos heavily criticized Arroyo's decision. Estrada's son, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, retaliated by asking Ramos to first \"come clean\" on the alleged multi-billion-peso anomalies involved in the PEA-AMARI, IPP and other deals negotiated during his term.Sold Petron to AramcoThis resulted to the loss of the government's effective leverage on domestic oil prices. Along with the deregulation of the entire oil industry, Petron's privatization is blamed for the continuing surge in oil prices that has particularly proved to be deleterious to the masses amidst the obtaining high petroleum costs in the global market.Sold National Steel Corporation to the MalaysiansThe National Steel Corporation was Philippine-owned and the biggest steel mill in Asia at that time. The steel mill was located in Iligan City.Wikileaks ExposéOn August 30, 2011, Wikileaks exposed reports sent by the United States Embassy in Manila that contain detail that the Libyan government under Muammar Gaddafi allegedly contributed USD 20,000 to the presidential campaign of Ramos in 1992.The report said it was former House Speaker Jose de Venecia who brought Ramos to Gaddafi. Reports said that Ramos and De Venecia \"had been engaged in shady dealings in both Libya and Iraq involving construction contracts for his firm, and had tried to \"repay\" his Libyan benefactors by acting as their front man and errand boy.\" The same report added that there was a lot of speculation when Ramos and De Venecia left for a secret trip abroad in middle of the 1992 campaign, and implied that this connection with the Libyan government was one of the objectives.Section 95 of the Philippines' Omnibus Election Code enumerates prohibited sources of political contributions and one of them is \" Foreigners and foreign corporations.\"In addition, \"It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution from any of the persons or entities enumerated herein,\" the Code said. Sec. 81 of the Code also states,\"It shall be unlawful for any foreigner, whether judicial or natural person, to aid any candidate or political party, directly or indirectly, or take part in or influence in any manner any election, or to contribute or make any expenditure in connection with any election campaign or partisan political activity.\"The Wikileaks exposé makes Ramos administratively and criminally liable under the law. If charged and convicted for this offense, he can be fined and imprisoned. [source]",

They are not aware that eating meats such as pork and beef can contain a specific type of worm that can seriously affect their health.Once these worms enters your body, they can move throughout your eyes, your tissues, and even in your brain. Just the thought of having these worms inside your body is a very scary thing, but all of this can actually happen.According to the team of doctors in Addenbrookes Hospital at Cambridge, a patient came to the hospital complaining of severe headaches.The patient came back after a while for some tests, this time he was complaining for new symptoms.He said, he had recently visited China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, which are known as the countries having the most reported cases of the parasite known as Spirometra Erinaceieuropaei.Along with headaches, the patient also experienced seizures and weakness which are symptoms caused by the parasites.After he was diagnosed with an infection sparganosis, the doctors quickly remove the worms with operation because this is the only way to cure this infection.Thaeniasis is defined as an infection caused by parasites, beef tapeworm, pork tapeworm and Asian tapeworm. People can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or under-cooked beef or pork.People can get infected by these tapeworms in two ways:- The first one is by consuming under-cooked pork from infected pigs.- Second one is through contact with swine or human feces.",

INQUIRER FILE PHOTO/ MARIANNE BERMUDEZUsing the Japanese term for “cheers,” President Duterte raised a glass of cider, urged “Kanpai, bottoms up!” to continued friendships at the traditional reception for diplomats to which Vice President Leni Robredo had been invited but later told not to come.“You know, in the subdiplomatic gatherings, especially in Asia, we just say kanpai. It’s always bottoms up. So be careful with this, our Asian brothers and sisters. When they say kanpai, say, ‘no, just half of the kanpai,’ he said, to chuckles at his first vin d’honneur in Malacañang on Wednesday.“We believe that friends help each other and utilize constructive engagement to achieve common goals. In truth, we all share the same aspiration of greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President said in an exchange of toasts with Archbishop Giuseppe Pinto, the Vatican’s envoy and dean of the diplomatic corps.Robredo’s absence at the reception, attended by Cabinet officials, was reported byher spokesperson, Georgina Hernandez.An invitation to the event was sent on Dec. 28, she said. “On Jan. 4, Malacañang called the office to retract the invitation, stating that the guest list was limited.”Was it a diplomatic faux pas?“It is a prerogative of the Palace to invite those who they feel is needed to be there,” said Ernesto Abella, Mr. Duterte’s spokesperson.Robredo, one of the outspoken critics of Mr. Duterte’s war against drugs, resigned as housing secretary after she was told not to attend Cabinet meetings.She has been accused by Malacañang officials of plotting with the “Yellow” forces of former President Benigno Aquino III to oust Mr. Duterte.“Usually, disinviting, if it happens, is done quietly,” offered Manolo Quezon, a former Aquino communications undersecretary.Civility a casualtyFormer Vice President Jejomar Binay had been invited to Malacañang receptions, even after he had a falling out with Aquino.“From the first time Presidents and Vice Presidents did not come from the same party (Carlos P. Garcia and Diosdado Macapagal) and whenever Vice Presidents have parted ways politically with Presidents (Emmanuel Pelaez from Macapagal, Fernando Lopez from Ferdinand Marcos, Salvador Laurel from Corazon Aquino, Teofisto Guingona from Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo), civility between the two highest officials has been a casualty—from invitations to simply appearing in the same place,” Quezon said.“There have been instances when a first lady could disinvite people even after they showed up at Palace events. But normally, petty ostracism from events would be downplayed by both sides and restricted to gossip,” he said.Mr. Duterte used the occasion to renew his commitment to fight “three basic evils”—drugs, corruption and criminality.Among the ambassadors present were Sung Kim of the United States, Zhao Jianhua of China and Igor Khovaev of Russia.There was no blast against the United States in Mr. Duterte’s usually expletive-laden speech.He stuck mostly to his prepared speech, and only deviated from it toward the end when, after downing a glass of cider, he said, “Kanpai!”Disclaimer: Contributed articles does not reflect the view of .org.

    "body": "Our lives would be downright incomplete if we didn’t have our own dreams. Some dreams may appear small, though some of which appear big and some may deem as too ambitious, at least that’s what other people say to Wynona Pauline Catapang, who was ridiculed with countless remarks similar to that. But this super woman proves her haters not to underestimate the perseverance of someone who dreams big.Loading...Wynona was among those who were deemed as too dull-minded to stay in college for five years. Little did they know that this lady is taking three undergraduate degrees at once.Wynona, then, vented out her 5-year college experience through a lengthy graduation post on Facebook. She started her post with the pessimistic remarks she received,“Ay bobo 5 years na sa collegeWala ka pang napapatunayanMasyadong ambisyosa”Wynona looked back to the various stress factors she has encountered.“5 years. 5 years of hardships, stress, and tears. I remembered the days na nagkasabay ang thesis ng psych at masscom. Psych classes sa morning, production sa hapon hanggang gabi. Thesis pagkauwi. Shoot sa mga delikadong lugar while writing Psychological report. Thesis defense sa Masscom tapos thesis proposal naman sa Psych. Di magkanda ugaga every first day of sem kasi laging overlapping yung subjects sa given sched. Pabalik balik kay Dean at sa Reg para lang maayos yung sched. Different faces for every subject. Haha. Parang irreg ang peg. Laging nahuhuli sa mga announcement kasi wala sariling classrep. Kapagod.”She reminisced on the hurdles she had to leap over in order to move forward.“Then I was then questioning myself, worth it pa ba lahat? I was about to give up and drop my other course. It was so hard to maintain a cut-off grade especially that both of my courses have quota grade of B minus. Ang taas beshie. Both courses pa. There was a time na na-on probation na ko kasi naleleft behind ko na yung isang course. Tapos this Feb, I was so stressed sa thesis because of the deadline tapos my lola died pa.”She continued,“But then I guess God took me to this path and I had to deal with it. Kahit sabi ng iba wala pa kong napapatunayan sa mundo, na ambisyosa ako, I believe this would have been my greatest achievement in life as of now—to receive three degrees at the age of 21.”“But then I guess God took me to this path and I had to deal with it. Kahit sabi ng iba wala pa kong napapatunayan sa mundo, na ambisyosa ako, I believe this would have been my greatest achievement in life as of now- to receive 3 degrees at the age of 21.”She then revealed her secret, which is “diskarte.”The St. Scholastica’s College graduate thanked those people who helped her throughout her journey. She started off with her friends, then her parents who provided her needs and supported her in achieving her milestone.The hardworking gal capped off her post with her name along with the degrees she has attained,“CATAPANG, WYNONA PAULINE MAGBANUABachelor of Arts in Mass Communication minor in Development CommunicationBachelor of Science in PsychologyBachelor of Arts in Guidance and Counseling5-YEAR LIA/LIA PROGRAM”Congratulations on your feat, Wynona!Loading...Commentscomments",

She's utterly cute and that is why it's not surprising that she have already amassed over a million followers on her social accounts. We even featured her on our YouTube channel as Babe of The Month for July 2015.Although she sometimes posts content that falls under the category of naughty, she can be considered wholesome overall. But these past few days, her image has been painted in a bad light because of her being linked to a scandalous set of pictures going around social media.The said photos shows a couple in which the woman is of the same figure as Kim but the faces are blurry to the point that you can't recognize the facial features.After the said photos of questionable authenticity went viral, Ilagan issued a statement of her timeline:She vehemently denied being the girl shown in the said photographs and pointed out that it was all just edited images made to look like her and that the motive of the individuals behind this so called Kim Ilagan scandal was just to gain followers for themselves.If you have been following our posts for a while now, you probably know who Kim Ilagan is. To refresh your memory, she is that one cute internet celebrity who's quite popular on FB with her \"Uwi ka na babe, hindi na ako galit video\" and Tagalized song covers.",

    "body": "They seem poles apart in many ways – geographically they sit at opposite ends of their region; one is a presidential, constitutional democracy; the other, a Marxist-Lenninist, one-party state. Their food, language and cultures also have little in common; but all those differences are diminished by one thing they both share. A desire to trade with each other.The personal invitation from Vietnamese Prime Minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, to Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, to visit his country – though largely ignored by the mainstream media – is positive and significant. So too is the fact that the two heads of state spent around 20 minutes in private conversation on the sidelines of the just-ended Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in the Lao capital, Vientiane.And when Duterte makes that trip to Hanoi – expected to happen sometime before the end of the year – bilateral trade will feature strongly in their talks. Yes, there will be other issues – not least their respective South China Sea disputes with China – but improving trade relations will take much of the focus.Also, last month, Ramon Lopez, Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry, met his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Tuan Anh, at another Asean gathering in Vientiane; the group’s Economic Ministers’ Meeting. And they will meet again at the Vietnam-Philippines Joint Sub-Committee on Trade to be held in the Philippines possibly later this month. On the agenda there will be a number of proposals to improve commercial cooperation and boost trade.All this is positive news for the Philippine export sector which has been languishing in the doldrums for the past year. But while exports generally have dwindled, Philippines-Vietnam trade has been going in the opposite direction in both volume and value. Last year, the two countries did US$3 billion worth of business – that’s almost double the US$1.63 billion it did in 2014. This year it’s expected to bump up by another 15% at least.And while the bilateral trade is dominated by two items – Vietnamese rice imports to the Philippines and electronic products (largely computers and accessories, accounting for 40% of all exports to Vietnam last year) going the other way – the mood is very much to expand the spread and variety of goods to be shipped market to market.Vietnamese brands of noodles, instant coffee and pepper are on the shelves of Philippine supermarkets; Philippine processed food items are increasingly appearing in Vietnamese stores. The Philippine construction industry relies on Vietnamese cement while Vietnam’s farmers depend on the shipments of Philippine cattle feed and fertilizers.Both Manila and Hanoi value this economic partnership and would like it to develop into other areas of collaboration – cross-investing, people-to-people exchanges, cooperation in tourism and education.Certainly, there’s a long way to go. Presently, within Asean, the Philippines is only Vietnam’s sixth largest trading partner. Going the other way Vietnam is the Philippines fifth largest among the 10 states. But the framework for much of this desired expansion is already in place – the Strategic Partnership Agreement inked by the presidents of the two countries last November. This specifically targets areas which both sides want to develop – not least investing much more in each others economies.It is envisioned as a two-way street for trade from which both partners will benefit; in the words of a Vietnamese proverb: “Eat the plum you have been given, but give back a peach”.",

    "body": "\"The incumbent President shall continue to exercise legislative powers until the first Congress is convened.\" EO 163 s. 1987, which was issued way before the First post-EDSA Congress convened. That is, despite being just an EO, EO 163 has the force and effect of a Republic Act because Cory had ersatz dictatorial powers right after EDSA and right before Congress convened. The First post-EDSA congressIn short, EO 163 sufficiently provides legal existence for CHR so no, CHR's legal existence is not in question. Specifically, Art. XVII Sec. 6 of the 1987 Constitution states:EO 163 s. 1987, which was issued way before the First post-EDSA Congress convened.The First post-EDSA congress convened in July 1987 , about two months after Cory Aquino issued EO 163.In short, EO 163 sufficiently provides legal existence for CHR so no, CHR's legal existence is not in question.But wait, there's more.Why bother asking? Truth be told, a lot of Filipinos aren’t very happy with the CHR of late, and many are calling for its abolition mainly due to its disturbing politicization.For example, former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chair Chito Gascon has been travelling all over world denouncing allegedly Duterte-sanctioned human rights violations, despite the fact that (1) there is no concrete evidence that the HR violations are indeed sanctioned by the palace and (2) it is not within the CHR’s mandate to go overseas and disparage the government.I think, however, that the Commission on Human Rights should not be abolished because the issue here is less on the legitimacy of CHR’s real purpose and more on doubts surrounding Chairman Gascon’s real motives.The House of Representatives share the same opinion, in my belief. After appropriating a measly P1,000 annual budget for CHR, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he may reconsider this if Gascon resigns [But of course, Gascon will NOT resign. Let me tell you why, then let me tell you what we can do about it.Why Gascon will not resign If Gascon resigns, LP will lose its best propaganda tool.The continued existence of a political party depends on its ability to project political relevance, and this is possible mainly through having party members occupy influential positions in government, positions that they can use for propaganda. That is, the continued existence of a political party is concomitant to its access to propaganda tools.Unfortunately for Gascon’s Liberal Party, its members occupy only six key avenues of power, and these are:The Vice-presidency, via LP Chairperson Leni Robredo, The Senate, via the 5 LP stalwarts senators, The Ombudsman, via Aquino-appointee Conchita Morales, and The Commission on Elections, via Aquino-appointee Andres Bautista The Supreme Court, via Aquino appointee Maria Lourdes Sereno. The CHR, via former LP director-general and Aquino-appointee Jose Luis “Chito” Gascon. Now, let’s discuss the effectiveness of each.LP’s Propaganda Tools FIRST , VP Leni Robredo tried to disparage the Duterte Administration, but she has neither the widespread charisma nor the intellectual aptitude so she’s largely ignored. Case in point, her popularity ratings continue to dip, with her net approval rating rivalling that of former VP Binay at his lowest point.SECOND , LP is also losing steam in the Senate. It’s primary attack dogThus, we are left with Senators Aquino, Pangilinan, and Drilon. Note that the other two LP senators Villanueva and Recto are already members of the Senate majority bloc so I wouldn’t consider them part of LP’s propaganda arsenal.LP Senators from left: De Lima, Aquino, Pangilinan, Drilon, and Hontiveros. Trillanes is from the Nacionalista Party but he has no party loyalty, and serves as LP's attack dog in the Senate. Now, Drilon and Pangilinan are LP stalwarts, but they’re political chameleons. While they would defend LP, they simply are not the kind of people who would stick their neck out for their party. This bears repeating: THE CHR IS NOT LEGAL FICTION.But wait, there's more.Truth be told, a lot of Filipinos aren’t very happy with the CHR of late, and many are calling for its abolition mainly due to its disturbing politicization.For example, former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chair Chito Gascon has been travelling all over world denouncing allegedly Duterte-sanctioned human rights violations, despite the fact that (1) there is no concrete evidence that the HR violations are indeed sanctioned by the palace and (2) it is not within the CHR’s mandate to go overseas and disparage the government.I think, however, that the Commission on Human Rights should not be abolished because the issue here is less on the legitimacy of CHR’s real purpose and more on doubts surrounding Chairman Gascon’s real motives.The House of Representatives share the same opinion, in my belief. After appropriating a measly P1,000 annual budget for CHR, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he may reconsider this if Gascon resigns [ GT ].But of course, Gascon will NOT resign. Let me tell you why, then let me tell you what we can do about it.If Gascon resigns, LP will lose its best propaganda tool.The continued existence of a political party depends on its ability to project political relevance, and this is possible mainly through having party members occupy influential positions in government, positions that they can use for propaganda.

It’s primary attack dog Trillanes is toast . Its next attack dog, Senator Leila de Lima, is in detention for letting her primordial itch pave the way for the drug menace. It’s third attack dog, Kidnapper-Senator Risa Hontiveros , has become the nation’s laughing stock after gloriously bungling several times, and is at immediate risk of being perpetually disqualified from public office for wiretapping Justice Secretary Aguirre Thus, we are left with Senators Aquino, Pangilinan, and Drilon. Note that the other two LP senators Villanueva and Recto are already members of the Senate majority bloc so I wouldn’t consider them part of LP’s propaganda arsenal.Now, Drilon and Pangilinan are LP stalwarts, but they’re political chameleons. While they would defend LP, they simply are not the kind of people who would stick their neck out for their party.THIRD , the Ombudsman in itself is not a very powerful propaganda tool because it needs to work alongside other officials to pin someone down. And even if it were, Ombudsman Morales will step down in July 2018, so her days in power will be over 10 months from now.FOURTH , Comelec isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool either. It’s relevant only during the election season. Moreover, the embattled Bautista’s hold on power is already questionable, as fellowFIFTH , the Chief Justice isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool, as CJ’s typically inhibit from speaking publicly and let’s be honest: only a handful of Filipinos actually spend time reading her court decisions.Thus, we have only one avenue left: The Commission on Human Rights .Thus, If Gascon resigns, LP will lose the single most effective propaganda tool in its arsenal. So yes, Gason will not resign. But then, is resignation the only way to kick Gascon out?Removing Chito Gascon Some camps argue that Chito Gascon can only be removed through impeachment. But it seems that very question whether Gascon is an impeachable official or not, so let’s ask:Is the CHR chairman an impeachable official? The 1987 Constitution clearly lists down the types of impeachable officials. Specifically, Art. XI Sec. 2 lists impeachable officials as:The President The Vice-president The members of the Supreme Court The members of the Constitutional Commissions, and The Ombudsman. Thus, Gascon is an impeachable official if he’s a member of a constitutional commission. Thus, let’s ask:Is the CHR is a constitutional commission? At first glance, it appears that the CHR indeed is a constitutional commission, as an entire article in the Constitution is dedicated to its creation. However, Article IX, explicitly entitled “Constitutional Commission”, does NOT include the CHR in its list of constitutional commissions.Specifically, Art. IX (A) Sec. 1 states:The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent, are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit. Yes, there’s no CHR in the list.Some camps may argue that the CHR, while not explicitly listed in Art. IX as a constitutional commission, can still be considered a constitutional commission because the Constitution itself created it.I found a very interesting sentence in EO 163 s. 1987, Sec. 2(d), which states:The Chairman and the Members of the Commission on Human Rights shall receive the same salary as the Chairman and Members, respectively, of the Constitutional Commissions, which shall not be decreased during their term of office. Take a harder look at the phrase “the same as… the... members… of the Constitutional Commissions...”. Cory used the phrase “of the Constitutional Commissions” instead of “of other Constitutional Commissions”, implying that Cory herself may not have considered the CHR a constitutional commission to begin with.But that’s not enough to definitive answer the question so…Fiscal Autonomy of Constitutional Commissions Article IX (A) Sec. 5 of the 1987 Constitution states:The [Constitutional Commissions] shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Their approved annual appropriations shall be automatically and regularly released. In short, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the CHR should enjoy fiscal autonomy.However, in CHR Employees vs CHR [“This Court is convinced that the [Constitutional Committee] had intended to grant to the respondent the privilege of having its approved annual appropriations automatically and regularly released, but nothing more.” The High Court ruled that the CHR enjoys limited fiscal autonomy, as opposed to absolute fiscal autonomy accorded to the Constitutional Commissions. That is, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the Supreme Court would have categorically stated that CHR has fiscal autonomy in accordance with Art. IX (A) Sec. 5... but the Supreme Court did not. Aquino, on the other hand, appears to have presidential ambitions, and if he has been intently watching Leni Robredo, he must have realized that attacking the massively popular administration will obliterate his political future., the Ombudsman in itself is not a very powerful propaganda tool because it needs to work alongside other officials to pin someone down. And even if it were, Ombudsman Morales will step down in July 2018, so her days in power will be over 10 months from now., Comelec isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool either. It’s relevant only during the election season. Moreover, the embattled Bautista’s hold on power is already questionable, as fellow Comelec commissioners called for his resignation amidst the Andy-Tisha scandal , the Chief Justice isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool, as CJ’s typically inhibit from speaking publicly and let’s be honest: only a handful of Filipinos actually spend time reading her court decisions.Thus, we have only one avenue left:Thus, If Gascon resigns, LP will lose the single most effective propaganda tool in its arsenal. So yes, Gason will not resign. But then, is resignation the only way to kick Gascon out?Some camps argue that Chito Gascon can only be removed through impeachment. But it seems that very question whether Gascon is an impeachable official or not, so let’s ask:The 1987 Constitution clearly lists down the types of impeachable officials. Specifically, Art.

That is, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the Supreme Court would have categorically stated that CHR has fiscal autonomy in accordance with Art. IX (A) Sec. 5... but the Supreme Court did not.CHR cannot be a constitutional commission.Let’s me restate:The Supreme Court said the CHR enjoys LIMITED fiscal autonomy, which means it is not a Constitutional Commission, which enjoys full fiscal autonomy. Because CHR is not a constitutional commission, its members are NOT in the list of impeachable officials. Yes, the CHR is a Constitutional Office but it is NOT a Constitutional Commission.Let’s me restate:Particularly, CHR chair Chito Gascon is not an impeachable official.Not impeachable means no ImmunityFor example, Greco Belgica’s disbarment case versus Ombudsman Morales was dismissed on the grounds that impeachable officials are immune to lawsuits that would in effect impeach them, as evidenced by Ombudsman vs CA and Mojica [“The Ombudsman or his deputies must first be removed from office via… impeachment… Should the tenure of the Ombudsman be thus terminated by impeachment, he may then be held to answer either criminally or administratively e.g., in disbarment proceedings…” With Gascon not enjoying immunity, we can actually file administrative or criminal charges against him, charges that will not be dismissed on the ground of immunity, charges that, if proven, will merit his removal from the CHR.Again, impeachment for Gascon won’t be necessary: it’s just a matter of filing (and winning) administrative or criminal cases for Gascon to be removed from CHR… and my sources tell me that a case is already in the works.

[ TPI have read some posts questioning the legal existence of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, with the argument being that there is no enabling law creating CHR. That is, while the Constitution provides for the creation of a CHR, the current CHR is created only by virtue of an executive order, which is EO 163 s. 1987 EO 163, which was issued in May 1987, or three months after the 1987 was ratified. This date of issuance is important in light of the 1987 Constitution’s Transitory Provisions.",

Kadugo ko ‘yan eh. Small matter, gamitin lang ‘yung Malacañang,” ani Duterte.“Wala naman ako doon. But even if I was there, itong granddaughter ko magpa-picture, lahat nga ng mga bisita pumupunta diyan, nagpapa-picture eh,” dagdag pa nito.Si Isabelle ay apo ni Pangulong Duterte sa anak nitong si Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte at dating asawa nitong si Lovelie Sangkola Sumera.Matatandaang kamakailan ay kumalat sa social media ang larawan ni Isabelle sa ilang bahagi ng Malacañang suot ang ilang magagarbong gown bilang bahagi ng kaniyang pre-debut photoshoot.Umani ito ng iba’t-ibang reaksyon mula sa publiko kung saan ang iba ay nagsasabing hindi angkop sa naturang okasyon ang pagpo-photoshoot sa Palasyo na itinuturing na opisina ng Pangulo.Dahil sa mga tinamong batikos, hindi na rin napigilina ni Isabelle na magsalita ukol sa isyu.Sa kaniyang Twitter post, sinabi ni Isabelle na imbes na pagtuunan ng pansin ang kaniyang pre-debut photoshoot at ituon nalang ng publiko ang kanilang atensyin sa ibang mas mahahalagang isyu sa bansa.“I hope you do something useful with the freedom you are given, other than making hateful comments and carry so much unnecessary weight on your shoulders,” aniya.“I hope you will find the maturity to focus on more alerting issues and not on a 17 year old girl. Try to be uselful,” dagdag pa ni Isabelle.Source: ABS-CBN News | Pinoy TrendingCommentscomments",

On the other hand, the Church leaders have shown support for the anti-drug campaign but stated they are against the killings associated with it.President Duterte also asked Church leaders to talk to village chiefs. Village chairs, he said, were not in the frontline of this war on drugs because “40 percent of them are involved in drugs. You see? That’s how serious the problem is.”“We are now a narcostate. You ask why I did not tap the barangay captains (village chiefs)? I cannot trust the idiots anymore,” the President said.He stated he had to tap the military’s help in destroying drug factories and running after all drug suspects. He’s no longer trust the village chiefs because of the involvement of many village officials in drugs. But he emphasized that his order did not include killing the suspects.“You can ask the military or the police in Manila if I ordered them to (kill drug suspects). If anyone of them stands up and say I ordered them to kill the poor and the children, I would resign because that would make me a liar.”“That’s the truth,” he added.He said the Church would always find fault in his antidrug campaign because of what he said were irreconcilable positions on how to deal with the drug menace.“For them, it’s pity and not hatred,” the President said. “No response. But the law is not like that. It takes pity on you but at the same time punishes you by jailing you,” he said.He also said the war on drugs did not target the poor.“I am here to enforce the law,” the President said",

    "body": "The Volatilian™ makes no apology for its support of the law-and-order policies being pursued by the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. We will not be joining the bleating chorus of protest and indignation being expressed by the foreign media and so-called liberty groups from Australia to Alaska who place the rights of drug gangs and criminals above the wretched lives of those who have to live among them.These critics, mostly, live in safe, comfortable environments; their daughters are not routinely raped – as one is every 54 minutes in the Philippines; their young children don’t need to be protected 24/7 from drug peddlers who prowl their neighbourhoods; neither are they either mugged or their homes broken into every 16 minutes. Nor are they murdered every 57 minutes.It is easy for rights groups and op-ed writers in London and Los Angeles to display their self-righteous anger over what is happening in the Philippines, re-echoing the populist shout for “due process”. But pitifully few have ever witnessed first hand the price that ordinary Filipinos pay daily to survive in the living hell that is their home – few, if any, have ever had to pay that price.And where were the editorials prior to Duterte’s crackdown – the ones that should have exposed the plight of the people and the extent of this scourge? They were never written; most of the coverage over the past eight years has been about how well the economy was doing and the stellar performances of the Philippine stock market. Where were the human-rights advocates who should have been railing at the terror and the indignity to which those in these neighbourhoods are subjected day in and day out? They were silent. After all governments, not criminals, have always been their preferred soft target of choice.We also hear a great deal from these quarters about the overcrowding in the country’s prisons and the city jails, but these constitute the extent of the Philippines’ custodial facilities. Successive governments failed to address the need for greater prisoner accommodation. Quezon City Jail, the main detention centre for those recently arrested for drug offences, was built 60-plus years ago; New Bilibid Prison, the country’s main penitentiary, was new in 1940. These are not problem’s of Duterte’s making, like the drugs pandemic they are part of his inheritance. And part of what he is desperately trying to clean up.Moreover, dishonest coverage which takes the photograph of a young woman cradling the lifeless body of her lover in a dirty Manila street after a gun battle with police – an image that brings to mind Michelangelo’s iconic Pietà, in which the Virgin Mary holds her son, Jesus, after his crucifixion – is nothing more than agenda-driven journalism. It may sell papers but it does not address the real and present greater horror of life in a Philippine barangay – a place where a 12-year-old girl sells her body to earn money so her elder brother can buy drugs. Where’s that photograph? Where’s the breast-beating over that child’s life?If you want an image of a blighted Metro Manila barangay in 2016, pictures of the Victorian slums of London come close. It’s the same crime, the same violence, the same addiction even though the drug of choice has switched from cheap gin to shabu, or crystal meth. The lives of the residents are no better and up until now they had no one in their corner fighting for them. The foreign media never has, nor have those groups who profess to care for society’s oppressed and disadvantaged.The cold hard facts of life are these. The Philippines is faced with a drug plague which is bringing society to its knees. And unless it’s tackled now, this economy – forget the stock market, it’s an irrelevance – and its people will ebb ever closer towards a failed state that can only then be resuscitated by even greater law-enforcement intervention, and probably martial law. And we don’t dismiss that possibility even now. It is a war, and as in all wars collateral damage is inevitable. But regrettable though that is, it should not be used to undermine the government’s real purpose of freeing its people from the grip of an industry that continues to kill their aspirations, their hopes and their children – not to mention the true economic potential of the country.And so for our part, we will not be criticising President Duterte, nor efforts by the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to use whatever means they have to in order to rescue their country and its people from a pestilence that has already claimed vast multiples of the up to 700 lives that have fallen in the past five weeks of this crackdown.The results of doing nothing are plain for anyone to see if they care to look. Duterte was swept to power on a promise that the drug gangs would be driven out. That is the people’s will and he is now honouring it by fulfilling his promise to them.",

Yellow bloggers including Robles sharply criticized the event for all the reasons they could muster — from inappropriate use of the palace to donning four different expensive gowns to choosing a blood red-colored gown.Robles claims that her investigation shows that Isabelle is not about to officially become an adult, but is, on the contrary, just 15 years old.Well, Robles takes pride in her revelation, but it also opens up a possible criminal case against her for child abuse.Republic Act 7610 protects Filipinos under the age of 18 from psychological abuse and emotional maltreatment — both of which Robles committed in her blog and Twitter posts criticizing the Malacañang photo shoot.If she had been 18, the law would not have applied to Isabelle. But thanks to Robles, we now know that Paolo Duterte’s daughter is very much a minor.Violation of RA 7610 carries with it a penalty of prison mayor — or up to 6 years in jail.Imagine Robles blogging from inside prison.Advertisements",

Josephine Lapira was a former student of the University of the Philippines.She is known as an activist who regularly promote her political beliefs to women and recruited them to join her. She was the Secretary General of the Gabriela Youth.She was one of the 15 killed in the firefight.The AFP has retrieved personal belongings, guns, foods and grenades from the rebels. The fight broke when authorities received a tip that several rebels are on their way for an operation.Maj. Engelberto Nioda Jr., commander of the PAF 730th Combat Group, said authorities were tipped off to the presence of vehicles “full of armed rebels” in Nasugbu, 65 kilometers south of Manila.Delvo said joint police and military checkpoints were set up on the routes to Calatagan and Balayan towns after they received information about the vehicles.“We were expecting them to pass by that road, as that would be the usual exit route, but they instead took a turn and headed toward the direction of Tagaytay [Cavite]. There were also checkpoints there,” Delvo said.The authorities encountered two – an unmarked jeepney and a van – in the adjacent villages of Aga and Kaylaway, along the dimly lit part of the Tagaytay-Nasugbu highway.“The jeep did not stop [for inspection] and [the passengers] opened fire at our troops,” Delvo said.Meanwhile, CPP-NPA Chief Joma Sison is calling the Commission of Human Rights to investigate the killings of his 15 warriors.Your thoughts on this?

It may have been fun for them, as people can only see them as a l0vely couple kissing in the sea, but underneath, something horrible happened that made them end their session.Making l0ve should be done in bed or in private places. However, there are cases wherein couples couldn’t wait and decide to simply do the deed in any public place. There are some, however, who have been caught on cam. But that is not the worst thing in the following story.Unexpectedly, the guy could not disengage himself from his girlfriend. The couple stayed that way until a woman gave them a towel so they can cover up and walk to the shore. Though a doctor was called and came to the rescue, he, as well, could not separate the l0vers so the two were immediately sent to the nearest hospital.This Italian Couple Got Stuck Together when they made a Love Making in Public! ”As per the doctors, what happened to them was a rare case of p*nis captivus. wherein v*gina muscles clamp down firmly on the p*nis.When the p*nis is in the v*gina it becomes increasingly engorged. The muscles of the woman’s pelvic floor contract rhythmically at org*sm. While those muscles contract the p*nis becomes stuck and further engorged,” UK-based s*xual physicalDean said. The two were separated after the woman got an injection that distends the uterus.This should be a lesson that l0ve making should be done privately and we should be precautions as well when making l0ve with our partners.

He did not feel it at first although the lower part of his legs was covered in blood when he emerged from the water.He initially thought he might have stepped on sharp rocks but the tiny pin-prick sized holes on his legs tells him that is not the case. His family said there were tiny marine creatures eating up at his legs.They washed the wounds with water but realized they could not stop the bleeding so they rushed Sam to the hospital where staff were baffled by the tiny pin-sized holes all over his legs. One of the nurses at the hospital suggests that it might be sea lice that bit him.The father of the victim decided to find out himself the next morning. He cast a net full of chunks of raw meat at the spot where his son had taken a dip. As he suspected, it was some tiny flesh eating marine creatures that tried to eat his son's legs. But what was it?No one knows what the creatures are exactly. Mr. Kanizay contacted a number of marine experts and other medic professionals around Melbourne and show them the footage he took of the little flesh-eaters feasting on chunks of raw meat, but no one could tell him what those tiny creatures are called.One marine life expert Michael Brown told Sunrise, a news website, that they might be \"jellyfish larvae\".\"I've been doing this for coming on 20 years now and I've never seen anything like this,\" he said.According to Melbourne marine biologist Michael Keough, sea lice s the most probable culprit because they are known to be scavengers that cleans up dead fishes. Others disagree, though. Some people on the internet argues that sea lice are so small they can't inflict a wound that bleeds that much.",

A common reaction to the announcement was: why only 90? It must be just the first batch, with the 90 mostly members of the PNP officer corps.The President surely believes that there are more than 90 “gangsters” in the police service. He had once described the PNP as “rotten to the core.” Besides corruption, cops have been implicated in criminal activities including kidnapping, carjacking and drug trafficking. The President’s so-called narco list includes police officers including generals. In his bloody war against illegal drugs, vigilantes executing civilians are widely suspected to be the so-called “ninja cops” who are permanently silencing potential witnesses against them. Purging the PNP of such scalawags is overdue.The President should not limit his anti-corruption purge to the PNP. It can be extended to other agencies notorious for corruption such as the Bureau of Customs. The Department of the Interior and Local Government also has disciplinary powers over barangay offices. In local governments, the President can prod his political allies to conduct similar purges. A thorough housecleaning is always welcome as the nation rings in a new year.",

LeongsonJAKARTA — ONE Lightweight Champion Eduard Folayang has no doubt that Team Lakay stablemate Geje Eustaquio is more than ready for his moment in the spotlight.Eustaquio headlines ONE: Total Victory at Jakarta Convention Center here as he faces Kairat Akhmetov on Saturday.“I believe Geje has prepared hard for this. He already said that he’s 101-percent ready and he’s confident that he will win, so for us, we believe in him,” he said.Folayang flew to this bustling capital city on Friday to be in Eustaquio’s corner when he takes on Kazakh contender.Seeing first hand how Eustaquio prepared for this bout in the Team Lakay gym in Benguet, Folayang believes that his teammate has made every right move to get himself back in contention in the flyweight division.“He sacrificed a lot. Though he failed before, I think he picked up lessons from those experiences,” the top lightweight in the promotion said, referring to Eustaquio’s submission loss to reigning ONE Flyweight Champion Adriano Moraes back in 2014.But times have changed and Folayang thinks that Eustaquio is once again ready to seize glory.“We believe he can make it and he’s ready to contend. He’s got a huge opportunity to challenge the champion, and I think he made the necessary adjustments to become the number one title contender again,” said Folayang.“We want him to headline one of the fights in the Philippines in the future. So for him to do that, he has to win here and give his best. This will make a huge impact in his career.”",

Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa said to Kerwin Espinosa last month as per a an Inquirer story.Despite several warnings from Bato, Kerwin resists to yield himself to the authorities.Since Duterte assumed his presidency, Kerwin had already been hiding and it was reported that he flew to Malaysia after undergoing a plastic surgery.In his speech in Palo, Leyte on Tuesday, Bato called the attention of the Police Regional Office 8 to hold the responsibility in capturing Kerwin; the number 1 drug lord in Eastern Visayas. Even though Kerwin had changed his identity through plastic surgery, Bato believes that through their diligence, along with the entire nation, they would be able to locate him as soon as possible.Earlier in August, Albuera Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. had surrendered after he was threatened by the strong remarks of Bato and after President Duterte himself declared “shoot on sight” if he resist.The mayor had been identified as one of the drug protectors of illegal drug trading in Leyte. Along with his family, Espinosa Sr. is presently under Bato’s supervision.During a press conference, Espinosa Sr. acknowledged to the public that his son Kerwin is also involved in the illegal drug trade and that he was being supplied with drugs by Peter Co; a drug lord who is currently detained at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City. However, he disclosed that he does not have any clue where his son could be found since the day Duterte won his presidency.",

Sources from Davao City Hall informed me that Rivera brought these three with him.The CheckEpilogueDONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:Sounds like a good idea! After all, an impoverished country like the Philippines can benefit from another charitable foundation on its shores.Noah Foundation’s Noah Coins is, for the most part, a low-cost remittance service that mainly targets OFWs. And just like any other newly-introduced remittance service, I felt it proper to check the reputation of the people behind it.Noah Coin’s website (NCW) lists six (6) key people, which it calls the “Noah Foundation Team”:1. Executive / Lawyer, Bruce Rivera, “Chief legal advisor for the Duterte presidential family of the Philippines. Graduate of the San Beda Graduate School of Law.”2. Chief Technological Officer David Mezrahid, a “cryptocurrency lecturer at Princeton University. Also active as a private banker in Monaco.”3. Chief Director Clarke Robertson, a “CTO of a number of companies based in London. Active as a systems architect skilled in infrastructure development and network platform design.”4. Executive Martin Salvador, “CEO of Ark Technology Co., Ltd. Holds over 20 years of experience in project management spanning a number of different languages.5. Robbie Antonio, Supervisor of NOAH City, currently the managing Director of Century Properties and CEO of Revolution Precrafted.6. Bea Rose Santiago for Public Relations, “A Filipina actress who was also chosen as the 2013 Miss International. Active in a number of media both domestically and abroad.”Okay, hold on one second!Admitted to the bar in May 2006 [ Chan-Robles ], Cebu native Rivera is best known for defending, defended businesswoman and alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles [ Inq ]. With that said and as a political blogger who has been monitoring the Philippine government since 2015, I know for myself that Bruce Rivera is not the chief legal advisor of the “Duterte presidential family”. For one, Atty. Salvador Panelo is still the Presidential Legal Counsel, and I have yet to learn of a single court case where Rivera represented any member of Duterte’s immediate family.Something’s off. Let’s check another one.A google search using “ Mezrahid Princeton university ” does not show entries that definitively say that Noah Foundation CEO David Mezrahid indeed works for the illustrious Princeton University. Moreover, a look at the work history in his [ LinkedIn ] account shows that he’s been based in either Western Europe and HongKong but never in the United States.Princeton is in New Jersey, United States.Century Property’s Robbie Antonio’s [ Linkedin ] account doesn’t include anything about Noah Foundation, and I sincerely doubt that he’d involve himself in the field of cryptocurrency for the simple reason that he’s a lot better at doing other things.“Executive” Martin Salvador, which Noah claims to have over 20 years of experience in project management, turns out to have been a K-12 teacher in the United States from 2001 to 2012[ Linkedin ], so where did those “20 years” come from?Meanwhile, I cannot seem to find anything about “Chief director” Clarke Robertson, which the site claims to be a CTO (chief technology officer) of several London-based companies.And lastly, Miss International 2013 Bea Rose Santiago , supposedly Noah’s PR head… do I even have to explain this?So far, I have shown that Noah Coin’s website appears to be fraudulent. Unfortunately, it appears that some OFWs may have been defrauded as the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo ’s warned everyone in March 2017 against both purchasing Noah Coins and engaging with Noah Foundation.“BSP… has not issued authorization to The Noah Foundation and/or Noah Global Innovation Services Inc. (Noah Global) to engage in the pre-selling of Noah Coins nor recognize that Noah Coin is a national project,” the embassy said.The embassy added, “Noah Global has no secondary license or authority in selling and trading of bonds, securities and similar instruments.”Moreover, the embassy said Noah can’t be found in its registered address in the Net Lima building in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.According to Noah’s website, however, the company is located in Unit 3106 Trade and Financial Tower at 32nd St., Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.But it doesn't end there.The Noah website earlier claimed that one of its sponsors is Filipino-Chinese business tycoon Lucio Tan of the LT group. However, in an official press statement issued earlier this year, the Philippine National Bank said it or any of its affiliates are not connected with the Noah Project, Noah Coins, and Noah Foundation. According to PNB , “Rest assured that PNB and the LT Group of Companies shall not hesitate to take any and all appropriate legal action to address this misrepresentation.”The page claiming sponsorship from the LT group has since been taken down, although a screenshot of the entire page can be found by clicking here , and one of Noah Coin’s promotional videos claiming a connection with the LT Group’s Philippine Airlines still exists, as show at 13:00 of the following video:Something’s really off here, especially since I also discovered a similarly-named cryptocurrency, the NOAHcoin. Launched in 2014 , NOAHcoin is totally different from the Noah Coin discussed in this article, which has yet to be launched.In the relatively small world of cryptocurrencies, why would someone use a name that has been used before and the name of a failed cryptocurrency at that?Yes, all signs, so far, point to fraud.I tried to see how Noah Coins work by clicking on the “Buy” button at noahcoin.org. This led me to “ noahcoin.co ”, the Noah Coin payment portal. After registering and logging in, I clicked on “Order NOAH”, which is presumably that which will allow me to buy some coins.A popup notification appeared, as shown in the screenshot below:According to the popup, ”a notification was issued by the Embassy of the Philippines, as it was recently discovered that certain purchasers were carrying out excessive advertisement of NOAH COIN on their websites as agents.”This is confusing. A currency’s value depends heavily on how widely it is recognized, so advertising is key to its success. Why would Noah dissuade people from talking about the currency?I closed the popup and I was sent straight to the payment screen. From there, I saw that the lowest amount that I can buy is US$ 8333.33, with a promise that it will be worth US$ 9,333.33, presumably by the time Noah Coins are launched on 12 June 2018. There are two other options: $25,000 and $83,333.Of course, it’s one thing to require an “entry amount” of over $8,333 (Php 420,000) but it’s another thing for people to actually give Noah that money. However, a look at “Issue Invitation Code” page shows that a payment is necessary for a Noah user to earn bonuses for inviting other people into the system.Specifically, the “Issue Invitation Code” page states:Adding the fact that Noah discourages “excessive advertisement”, what we see here is a classic sign of a multi-level marketing (pyramiding) scheme, where people are required to pay an amount upfront before they are allowed to “sell” products to others.In short, the Noah Project is a pyramiding scheme that disguises itself as a remittance service, especially since it also has a “rewards” page that is atypical of labels in cryptocurrency portfolio management platforms.To make matters worse, the FAQ page explicitly states that Noah DOES NOT issue receipts. Yes, Noah expects people to shell out hundreds of thousands of pesos without proof of payment. The fact that payments can only be made through bitcoins makes the transactions even more untraceable.Here’s a video recording of what I did in Noahcoin.co:It appears that this whole thing was started by a Japanese national. Based on his Facebook post , Izumi Tadashi is the one who started the entire Noah thing: the foundation, the project, and the coins.Part of the Tadashi’s post states:Tadashi announced this on 11 December 2016. He posted this one month before Noah was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission:At this point, I have reason to believe that Tadashi is the \"power behind the throne\"... but how about the others? Did the website use the identities of the six people without them knowing? Or are the six actually in on it?On 02 July 2017, Atty. Rivera announced [ FB ]:Rivera wasn’t clear about what foundation it was. However, it appears to be a certain “Noah Global Innovation Foundation” or “Noah Foundation Japan”, judging from his post on 22 August 2017 [ FB ].After a little more digging, I discovered that Rivera actually brought in August 2017 two Noah co-founders – Clarke Robertson and Martin Salvador – to Davao to meet Davao Mayor Inday Sara Duterte-Carpio. With Rivera, Robertson, and Salvador was Japanese National Izumi Tadashi.To promote his illicit overseas business, it seems that Rivera used Duterte-Carpio without the latter being aware of it. After all, who would think that a \"foundation\" would be a money remittance service?I sure won't.Tadashi and the gang even appeared at the DDS Global Thanksgiving Event held in August 2017 at the Crocodile Park in Davao City, donating P1-million to the Armed Forces. Sources informed me that the event was largely sponsored by Tadashi himself.Well, thanks! But at the cost of OFW who may lose hard-earned money to a pyramiding scheme?What we have here is Noah Coins, a cryptocurrency that offers itself as a cheap way for OFWs to remit money to the Philippines… but all signs point to a pyramiding scheme. It is unclear as to how many have bought Noah coins mainly because Noah’s payment portal does not issue receipts, i.e. it will be difficult to prove who paid what when.Noah Coins are issued by Izumi Tadashi brainchild Noah Foundation, with confirmed founders being Atty. Bruce Rivera, Clarke Robertson, and Martin Salvador. The Foundation also appears to be the financier behind the foreign trips of Rivera’s group that includes fellow bloggers MJ Quiambao Reyes and Rocky Gonzales.Noah’s administrators have a penchant for claiming association with big names in Philippine business and politics, presumably to help gain the trust of prospective clients. It has, however, been threatened with legal action after Lucio Tan’s PNB found out, and the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo has already advised OFWs to exercise caution in dealing with the organization.With these, I have a few recommendations:1. Financial literacy programs for OFWs and their dependents so they are likely to fall prey to these kinds of scams.2. Tougher regulations for cryptocurrencies, because cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated today.3. Tougher enforcement of laws relating to overseas remittance services, especially those that involve unstable or newly-introduced cryptocurrencies.4. An SEC investigation with the option to pursue civil forfeiture proceedings against Noah’s founders, possibly to help OFW victims, if any.5. An NBI investigation on everyone involved with the Noah Foundation, and filing of charges if needed.On a final note, let me state the obvious reality that OFWs are already living very challenging lives, so I hope fellow Filipinos, especially those who masquerade as OFW champions, will not do things that will make their lives even more challenging.

Some said,Sir Greco pag sinabi ba ng sundalong kanin na the burden of proof is at your hands, kaya nyo ba ang challenge na ibibigay nya?...pagkaya dikdikin na yan para mawala na yang cocky na senador nakaka buwisirNice one sir. Witch hunt lng ginagawa nya. Not the credible spokesperson when talking about corruption. He mis used his budget by enlisting family members and friends as consultants.Wow sir Greco buti nagsalita kana. I believe you because it's you who really pushed for the unconstitutionality of DAP. Dapat balikan ni PRRD ang PDAF/DAP issue para managot na silang lahat.As of writing, Belgica's Facebook post already reached more than 1,100 shares and 5,800 different reactions.Like This Article",

    "body": "‘WITNESS NOT COERCED’Senator Leila De Lima had ordered an employee of the Department of Justice to deposit millions of pesos into the bank account of Ronnie Dayan, her former driver who President Rodrigo Duterte said collected money for her from convicted drug lords inside the New Bilibid Prison.Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre III made the allegation after some newspapers reported that two DOJ receiving clerks, identified as Jonathan “Jong” Caranto and Edna “Bogs” Obuyes, executed affidavits stating that De Lima asked them to deposit millions of pesos into a bank account.Aguirre said Dayan owned the bank account.“Binibigyan daw siya ng pera ni De Lima para i-deposit sa account ni Dayan,” Aguirre told reporters in an ambush interview.Aguirre denied De Lima’s claims that the two employees were forced to execute the sworn statements.“Mayroong affidavit at tsaka walang pumilit sa kanila…As a matter of fact, pumayag pa mag lie detector test ang dalawa,” Aguirre said.ALSO READ: DOJ Sec. Aguirre, pananagutin ni De Lima ‘sa tamang panahon’President Rodrigo Duterte earlier accused De Lima of having an affair with Dayan, who also allegedly collected money from drug lords inside the NBP in Muntinlupa.Both De Lima and Dayan figured in Duterte’s drug matrix that supposedly detailed the network of government officials and suspected drug lords.De Lima has repeatedly denied being involved in protecting drug dealers detained at the NBP.Asked if the amount of deposits would commensurate the employees’ salaries, Aguirre said: “Hindi. Maliit lang ang sahod sa kanilang dalawa.”The DOJ chief said the department was still looking into how the bank account, which was not under De Lima’s name, could be linked to the senator.De Lima had admitted that the two mentioned individuals were her former staff but claimed that they were coerced to executive affidavits in a bid to pin her down.ALSO READ: DOJ chief seeks to allow wiretapping at Bilibid“The alleged existence of accounts, that is a fabrication. I don’t think those two would have those accounts, instant millionaires nga sila,” De Lima said.The senator suspected that the move was connected to the pending investigation of the House of Representatives on the alleged proliferation of drugs inside the NBP during De Lima’s term as DOJ chief.“Ano ba yan? Dahil sa House inquiry, siguro nagpa-panic na sila. They have nothing. So ngayon, binibilisan na nila yung pag-fabricate, pag manufacture ng evidence na ‘yan,” De Lima said.source: GMA NEWSCommentscomments",

Then the incumbent President Duterte, now in a parliamentary form of government in 2022, shall continue — this is very important — shall continue his dual presidential role as head of state and at the same time as head of government leading and presiding over the new unicameral parliament. We need him still there up to 2022. Now, the third stage is May of 2022 when in the old Constitution, he is supposed to step down. The President said he wants to step down. By May 2022, President Duterte steps down as head of state and a new President elected by parliament to serve the remaining term of President Duterte. Or if the people want or then you put that — you provide that in the transitory provisions of the new Constitution that he will still serve up to that year, okay. This is a choice of the people. The fourth stage, from May 2025 to 2030, the second regular parliamentary elections under the new Constitution is held by 2025 with a five-year term to 2030. We then have a new Prime Minister and a new President,” ani Lorenzana.",

Antonio TrillanesIto ang mga taong maasahan natin sa lahat ng panahon. Ito ang mga taong willing magbuwis ng buhay. Sayang silang dalawa kung pabayaan natin and since pareho ang prinsipyo natin sa buhay, na ayaw natin ng patayan, hindi natin sila alisin sa tabi natin para maprotktahan sila at ang pamilya nila, at maprotectahan din nila tayo,” Trillanes said.Trillanes also added that the timing is good because he also needed additional bodyguards as he is receiving some threats from unknown people.Matobato earlier claimed of being a member of Davao Death Squad created by then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.He claimed to have killed several people under Duterte’s direction.Lascañas on the other hand belied Matobato’s claims, but later flipped and together with the latter, they filed extra judicial killing (ejk) charges against Duterte before the International Criminal Court, with Cong. Gary Alejano and Sen. Antonio Trillanes as sponsors.Both men are already retired but Trillanes their experience with handguns and some nasty jobs will be more than useful to protect him and his family.",

If it’s true I can understand the Danish,government’s “uneasiness”. All of this supposedly,occurred over a period of 6 months,during the initial breech. Although it happened from about,February to August in 2012 it still brings to light a few,interesting thoughts.According to Warg’s defense,team the hacks were definitely carried out on a computer that was OWNED by Warg. This same computer,was accessed by a number of different developers in Warg’s group and any one of them could have been the,responsible party. This seems to mirror the idea that, if you lend,someone your car and they accidentally kill a person with it, YOU are responsible. It’s definitely an arguable point.The big, ugly, greasy,monkey wrench in that whole theory is Mr. Warg’s own record and reputation since getting,accused of this invasion. He was initially arrested in his apartment in Cambodia In September of 2012 but, before Denmark could,extradite him, He was deported to Sweden to serve jail time for copyright theft because of being,involved with TPB (The Pirate Bay). While in Sweden he was tried yet again for hacking into a bank’s computers. He was finally taken to Denmark in November of 2013 and sat there for a bit. So, it took two years before he went to trial in Denmark for the CSC breeches. I wonder how much,disappeared in that time? Subsequently, Mr. Warg was sentenced to 3.5 years jail time as opposed to the,maximum of 6 years for this type of infraction to the law.This little piggy,would like to know if Mr. Warg was convicted by being associated with other hacking crimes or because he physically did it? Considering,there was no evidence found by the computer forensics “officials” pointing,directly to him as the actual culprit. Why was he convicted and his 21 year old partner (whose name was,withheld to protect his privacy…*cough cough*) walked off with time served? Was Mr. Warg portrayed as a horrible,man that attacked governments to a jury that really didn’t understand anything about technology? Was he a cyber-terrorist in the making? Is it all a giant, stinking pile of cow manure? The world may never know.It seems to,simply boil down to this; a man has been convicted by the legal system with evidence given to that system by a powerful,company instead of investigators finding their own.",

The soon-to-be-mother was not just carrying two babies – she was carrying five!Oksana Kobeletska was already a mother to a three-year-old girl when she got pregnant once more. For the majority of her pregnancy, Oksana thought that she was carrying twins. But a trip to the doctor’s office one day proved her wrong.While she was undergoing an ultrasound scan, her doctor’s face registered a big shock.The Ukrainian mom felt like she was doused with cold water upon learning the news:“When I saw the shock on the doctor’s face, my heart stopped for a moment. Then I heard him mumbling something like: ‘You deserve to get a big house by the sea…'”When it was finally confirmed that she was indeed carrying five fetuses, the news about her pregnancy spread like wildfire. According to statistics, a quintuplet pregnancy occurs only in 1 out of nearly 50 million pregnant women.According to the Mirror, Oksana’s pregnancy is the first reported case of quintuplets in the Ukraine!That being said, many people were excited to witness such a rare occurrence. The surprised mother was quoted as saying:“I’m very shocked because I thought that (I was having) twins or something like that. Nobody in our family has ever had it. There was not a single case of that kind. Generally speaking, I didn’t expect it and never anticipated it. I can’t even imagine right now how it is going to be, to raise so many children at once.”Although government officials and medical professionals in the Ukraine were thrilled at this miracle, the soon-to-be-parents of six were a bit more anxious than ecstatic. Understandable, as raising five children at the same time is no easy task.Oksana’s husband expressed his anxiety after knowing that his wife was carrying five babies.“It takes time to digest news like this. I mean, how would we manage to take care of so many children?”Eight doctors and nurses came to aid the Ukrainian mom while she was giving birth. Despite the possible complications, Oksana delivered five healthy babies with no major complications!After giving birth, the Ukrainian mom received a 100-square-meter apartment from the delighted city officials. The parents already had names ready for their quintuplets. The three boys and two girls were named Denis, Dariya, Vladislav, Oleksandra, and David.What are your thoughts about this miraculous story?

Sadya talagang inggitero at inggitero ang marami sa ating mga kababayan. Akalain mong ang simpleng photo shoot o picture taking na ito sa loob ng Malacanang ni Isabelle Duterte, unang apo o First Grandaughter ni Manong Digong, ginagawan ng isyu ng ilang mga gago at gaga!!! Kesyo hindi daw tama dahil isang lugar daw ito ng kapangyarihan o may nilabag daw na batas, etecetera, etcetera, etcetera. Hoy mga Ugok at ugak, walang nalabag na batas si Isabelle. At hindi rin masama ang pagpapalitrato niya sa Malacanang dahil PINAPAKITA NIYA ANG GANDA NITO ( kaya nga niya ginawang background sa pictorial di ba???). Ang masama kung binaboy at di na niya nirespeto ang lugar. Besides, First Grandaughter naman siya di ba??? So may K siya magpapicture sa opis ng Lolo niya…mga bobo at boba!!!!Yesterday, media outlets released the pre-debut photo of Isabelle Duterte taken inside Malacañang Palace.In photos posted on Instagram, Isabelle could be seen donning several different dresses including a red ball gown by Dubai-based couturier Garimon Roferos.The photos received mixed reaction from the netizens, some of them praised Isabelle for her beauty, while others questioned the legality of what the presidential grand daughter did.Some pointed out that posing in front of the Presidential seal is illegal.Let us know your thoughts about this in the comment section below.",

The law says that Tuason’s kickbacks are taxable, so we are going to pursue her bank accounts to see if we can recover what we can,” Henares said.Henares said that since Tuason has admitted to the kickbacks, her agency is now obligated to investigate and determine how much is owed to the government.Henares also said that Tuason “declared that she received around 40 million pesos, then it is our responsibility to make sure we get 30% of that, which is 12 million,” and adds that “it is in the best interest of the Filipino people that we see to it that this is recovered.”Atty. Dennis Manalo, legal counsel for Tuason said that it is the most absurd thing he has ever heard in his career as an attorney. He said that the money is the property of the people to begin with, and taking 30% of it basically is the same thing if Tuason returns the money.“There seems to be an eager, over implementation of the law here. My client has said that she will return the money, I think they (BIR) are just wasting their time,” Manalo said.Henares was told about Manalo’s reaction during lunch in Makati this afternoon, she simply said that “the law is the law, and we have to do our job.”A few seconds later, a grinning Henares comes back and says, “let’s see” and walks away.",

He is what can be described as a ‘meta-candidate’, one who changes the very conception of and expectations from a presidential candidate. In some ways, he singlehandedly changed the rules of the game. Throughout the campaign period, he crossed one redline after the other, and yet he managed to build a massive nationwide following. He reminded his opponents that presidency is a matter of life and death, of going to the distance, of risking it all.Despite rapid economic growth in recent years, the Philippines still suffers from one of the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in Asia — an uber-dynamic region that hosts nine out of thirteen economic miracles in modern times. Strongman candidates like Duterte and Marcos Jr. were in a particularly favorable position to present themselves as single-minded, decisive leaders who could bring about overnight solutions to the country’s perennial predicaments.One thing to note, Duterte is a seasoned lawyer and strategist. He knows exactly the weakness of his rivals. His brazen antics confused them but his pinpoint accuracy and irreversible timing battle plan outsmarted them all, grabbing an unprecedented victory with great finesse.duterte truly loves a filipino persons.no matter how high class corrupt and criminals if you againts the laws you must be punish Obama said.",

    "body": "Second Canadian hostage executed, Trudeau: we will not give into “fear mongering tactics”Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, confirms the death of Robert Hall who was taken hostage by the Islamic terrorist Abu Sayyaf group based in the Philippines. On April 25, 2016, Canadian John Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf operatives after the Canadian government refused to pay ransom.During the beheading of John Ridsdel (to watch the video of the beheading click here – Graphic content), the terrorists raised the index finger in a gesture that symbolizes their belief in the oneness of Allah, and chanted 14 times “Allah Akbar” in Arabic, meaning Allah (the name of God in Islam) is the greatest. Ridsdel’s severed head was later discarded in a nearby city.In a second video clip released by Abu Sayyaf terrorists featured the second Canadian hostage Robert Hall who conveyed the following message to the Canadian government (the transcript prepared by the SITE Intelligence Group): “To the Canadian government, I’m told to tell you to meet the demand. I don’t know what you’re doing, but you’re not doing anything for us. John has been sacrificed, his family has been decimated, and I’m not sure why or what you’re waiting for.”Following the second execution of a Canadian hostage, Trudeau issued on June 13, 2016 a statement condemning the “ vicious and brutal actions of the hostage-takers” without mentioning the Islamic nature of their ideology and their affiliation with ISIS.Trudeau reiterated that “terrorist hostage-takings only fuel more violence and instability” and that “Canada will not give into their fear mongering tactics” and will not pay ransom for hostages.The following is Trudeau’s statement:“It is with deep sadness that I have reason to believe that a Canadian citizen, Robert Hall, held hostage in the Philippines since September 21, 2015, has been killed by his captors. “While Canadian officials are working closely with authorities in the Philippines to formally confirm Mr. Hall’s death, we have compelling reason to believe that reports to this effect are, unfortunately, true. “The vicious and brutal actions of the hostage-takers have led to a needless death. “Canada holds the terrorist group who took him hostage fully responsible for this cold-blooded and senseless murder. “With the tragic loss of two Canadians, I want to reiterate that terrorist hostage-takings only fuel more violence and instability. Canada will not give into their fear mongering tactics and despicable attitude toward the suffering of others. “This is precisely why the Government of Canada will not and cannot pay ransoms for hostages to terrorists groups, as doing so would endanger the lives of more Canadians. “We are more committed than ever to working with the Government of the Philippines and international partners to pursue those responsible for these heinous acts and bring them to justice, however long it takes. “The Government’s top priority, and my own as Prime Minister, is the safety and security of Canadian citizens. “On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Hall. “They have suffered a terrible loss, and this is a devastating moment for them. Our thoughts are with them as they mourn this tragedy. I would ask that the media respect their privacy, and allow them time to come to terms with their loss. “Today marks yet another difficult day for Canada and for Canadians as we grieve as a nation for the loss of both John Ridsdel, who was killed on April 25, and Robert Hall.”On April 25, 2016, Trudeau issued the following statement condemning the murder of John Ridsdel:“statement by the Prime Minister of Canada on the death of Canadian John Ridsdel.“I am outraged by the news that a Canadian citizen, John Ridsdel, held hostage in the Philippines since September 21, 2015, has been killed at the hands of his captors.“Canada condemns without reservation the brutality of the hostage-takers, and thisunnecessary death. This was an act of cold-blooded murder and responsibility rests squarely with the terrorist group who took him hostage.“The Government of Canada is committed to working with the Government of Philippines and international partners to pursue those responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice.“On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Ridsdel. They have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them. Our thoughts are with them as they come to terms with this loss, and I would ask that the media respect their privacy at this difficult time.“The Government of Canada’s first priority is the safety and security of its citizens. The Government of Canada will not comment or release any information which may compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of the remaining hostages.”source: cijnewsCommentscomments",

    "body": "8 SHARES Share TweetThe AlDub fans were in overdrive for the past month after Maine Mendoza aired out her confession in her open letter on Twitter. There, she admitted that she wasn’t feeling comfortable with how some of the fans are trying to take over her life. She also clarified that she and on-screen partner Alden Richards were only friends.Since the controversy, the Dubsmash Queen hasn’t been seen on the noontime show “Eat Bulaga!”. Actually, there hasn’t been much update on the young actress until news about her leaving for a vacation in the US surfaced.The AlDub fans were, needless to say, dismayed. Even more so were the hard-core ones, who, until now, are still on the roll with their unreasonable show of support.For this, comedienne Ai-ai delas Alas was provoked and expressed her thoughts on the aforementioned fans after they flocked the comment section of her Instagram post.A video she put up on social media last Monday was a take on the Sunday Pinasaya party where co-actors Julie Anne San Jose and Alden Richards could be seen. While there clearly wasn’t a show of affection between the two, some AlDub fans still made a fuss about the post.A particular comment from a hard-core supporter reads:“Tignan nyo video magkatalokod ng yong tinawag pangalan ni julie may tingin sulyap bago sa camera hoy Julie boyfriend mo nga ba c benjamine alves o hindi sumera ka talaga ingat ka bka iwan ka sa ere sa ginagawa mo felling sikat at take note yong damit maine’s ootd ang maggaya c manga”One netizen who has had enough of the hate interjected:“Ito nanaman Ang mga fans na lahat nalang binibigyan ng kahulugan ultimo pagkurap ate. Susmio! Pwede ba! Mga tao din yan! Anong dapat iisyu dito? Na magkatabi sina alden at @myjaps? Utang na loob! Haha! Miss @msaiaidelasalas deadmahin nyo nalang po sila. Hindi ikakasulong ng bansa ang mga reaksyon nila. [sic]”Much to everyone’s surprise, the “Hay, Bahay” star decided to fan the flames after putting out a blunt statement directed to the said fans.Ai-Ai said:“yes deadma pero isa lang sabihin ko bago mag salita isip din muna wag mag paka bobo kasi si alden e nasa kabilang lamesa asawa ko nag vi video at masaya ang party naming atsaka lahat na lang binibigyan ng kahulugan kaya tingin ko dyan narindi ai maine kaka ganyan nyang mga fans na yan sobra namimihasa..”While it’s great that the AlDub fans appreciate their idols, hard-core fans should know how to draw the line at their enthusiastic show of support.Watch the video below:What can you say about Ai-ai delas Alas’ statement regarding the AlDub supporters? Do you agree to what she said about the hardcore fans? Let us know your thoughts and reactions on this story by leaving a comment below!",

When people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen.”The mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word.Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said,“I don’t know what you’re laughing about, your wife fell three times this week.“",

Umali, under a House Bill # 2767 dated 9 August 2017, relative to the implementation under PPP mode for the Construction, Operation, and Maintenance of the Mindoro-Batangas Nautical Bridge Highway connecting Mindoro Island to Batangas City.According to Oriental Mindoro Governor Alfonso Umali Jr. the brother of Congressman Reynaldo V. Umali, San Miguel Corporation offered to construct the said super bridge that has a total length of 15 km and will cover the 6.5 kilometers from Barangay Ilijan in Batangas City to Verde Island and 8.5 kilometers that will continue from Verde Island to Barangay Sinandigan in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro, over a 10m – 300m water depth.The Batangas-Mindoro bridge is touted to be the first floating bridge in South East Asia with high ship passage on its pontoons. The bridge will have pedestrian and bicycle lanes. The bridge will be designed to withstand typhoons with winds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).",

Rivera lambasted the senator for his comment about the refusal of PH to receive aid from the European Union.Aquino said the administration’s refusal to receive aid seems like a contradictory move to its proposal to raise taxes.An open letter from Atty. Bruce,Dear Bam,Bambambambambam….nakatulog lang ako na may make-up sa mukha, nagwala ka na naman.First of all, is this what we are paying you for? This is not thinking outside the box legislation like many of your fans will suggest. This is the mendicancy culture the oligarchs want Filipino to adhere to in order to subjugate them further.Organized religion taught us na “bahala na ang Diyos”, “maawain ang Diyos” and that we are all sinners. So, we have this culture of begging for forgiveness. And yes, it is an exercise of humility to some extend. However when there is too much humility and no self-respect, we reach a point of mendicancy. A point where it is okey to beg, just because we can.Bam, when foreigners give us aid, it is not friendship they are after. When you give to a beggar, are you after friendship? No. You give to a beggar in the street because you want him to leave you alone. Yes, there are so many reasons for giving but not all pertain to altruism. But let us not go into the motive of the giver. Most importantly, we should look into the motive of the receiver.Are we that desperate for money to the point that we will just swallow our pride just to get it? Many countries give us aid and we receive it. But if they will give subject to a condition that it goes to the very core of our independence and sovereignty, that is not giving. That is screwing. And we are not prostitutes. Or are we?Commentscomments",

So when the government –DOH thru DepEd launched a program of vaccines for dengue, I was happy because I believed that my children can now be safe from dengue, safe from any eventual hospitalization due to the dengue virus (sickness).I fully trusted the government, that the DOH and all the people in charge of this program have sound judgment and are 100% sure that the vaccine is 100% safe, not harmful and only useful to the Filipino citizens especially to children.I cannot believe until now that our government can use our children to become guinea pigs.

He doesn’t want to move because he had a terrible headache, muscle and joint pains, pain in his nape and in his eyeballs. He also have diarrhea and vomit everytime he eats or drink. Again I only self medicate because of financial constraint. I only give him biogesic, papaya sap and oresol.On November 25, 2017. he had convulsions and he was already dehydrated. I gave dolan suppository and gave him pocari sweats and buko juice. That’s when I was able to borrow money and finally bring him to a doctor for consultation and did laboratory tests.The result shows that his platelet is already high but he already has infections in his urine and and his white blood count is also high. He was given co-amoxiclav.The following day, his fever already subside. And because I have no money I wasn’t able to bring him to the hospital but all the symptoms of dengue manifested in him.It's been four days since I heard the news about the vaccine and it’s dangers and I couldn’t sleep until now, thinking how dangerous the situation my son faces. And I cannot forgive myself if something bad happens to him. I already have this trauma. And I wanted to know and have him checked through blood test if indeed he just had dengue so I can monitor my child closely. I cannot have peace of mind until the test is done but I cannot afford it on my own.I have watched Sec Harry Roque's press conference with Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy on Dengvaxia and I am so frustrated, disappointed and I felt betrayed. I cannot believe how the government downplayed the dengue issue.I cannot believe how Sec. Roque, being the mouthpiece of the president, could make pronouncements that are not factual. His ignorance to the subject ( dengue sickness) is not an excuse for him to make statements that is contrary to the real effect or real condition having a severe dengue. He should not let the public go blind on a real condition with a severe dengue.On the contrary, he should have at least educated the people especially the parents of recipients of that vaccine so we could assist our children carefully. I have followed posts on FB pages of several doctors for a week now and I learned a lot from them. Their posts are very informative and they explained it in laymans terms, so that any parent could easily understand how the dengue works in the body, how it could affect the other vital organs and how it can endanger the patient.Doctors like Dr Richard Mata, Dr Willie Ong and others.I am disappointed at how the government downplayed the issue. the harm, the danger the physical and emotional issues we parents are battling now.I have come to ask myself: where can we go and ask help? Who would help us if the government is very reluctant. How can we seek justice?Then it came to my mind: where else would we asked help but to the very agency who caused danger to our children? It is this agency's negligence that the lives our children is now at risk, their safety uncertain.Therefore I now ask the DoH thru you Sir to please help us in every way. This is the least that this government/Dept (DOH) can do for us. I for myself am asking for blood test for my child so I may know if he just got infected with dengue or not. And I need a written assurance from DOH that the it will shoulder all medical , laboratory fees , hospital bills from the onset of fever…meaning from monitoring to actual confinement to all/any hospital may it be public or private whichever is nearer when time/need arises.Please stop asking us to go to public hospitals if it is too far from our residence because some of us if not most don’t even have money for transportation. And we have to really consider the distance as it could affect a lot to the well being of the patient and to the guardian as well.I am also awaiting some measures from the government such as maybe giving insect repellents to the 10% of the recipients in which the DOH spokesperson claimed who has not infected with dengue prior to immunizations. Or maybe the government will again conduct the brgy “smoke something” to eradicate mosquitoes. Or anything that could help these 10% free from dengue . I am sure this measures is not as expensive as the cost of the vaccines itself.I also understand that this problem is not caused by the present administration but still it is the government who made it happened or bring this great danger to the lives of the children. So please let us for now just simply think And consider the welfare, the lives of the recipients.Although in my innermost self I wanted all the people behind it, Aquino, Garin and the rest to be jailed but what truly matters now is the life of my son. And the assistance I am now seeking.Thank you so much.I**** A*****Parent[: I withheld her phone number for her own protection.

    "body": "LAOAG CITY, Philippines — Vice presidential aspirant Leni Robredo was greeted by an almost empty Laoag International airport during her visit here, Friday morning.Unlike other national candidates who visited the province since the start of the campaign period, Robredo was welcomed by more or less 20 people, mostly Liberal Party provincial officials led by chairman Fernando Cabrales and airport employees.Ilocos Norte is a known bailiwick of Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. who is also running for vice president.“I got nothing to lose coming here. Even if this is a ‘Marcos Country,’ I think I owe everyone a chance to know me,” Robredo said.She said she expected that Ilocanos are more sympathetic with Marcos.“I am very realistic with my expectations. As long as I present myself, it’s up for the voters to decide (who they will be voting for),” Robredo said.She admitted though that the “Solid-North” is something to be worried about.“Since time in memorial, the North (Regions 1, 2 and CAR) has always been solid,” she said.Robredro however believes that voters now, specially the young ones, are open to new alternative candidates like her.“I have so much faith in the Filipino electorate already,” Robredo said.After her arrival at the airport, Robredo went to the Laoag Carmelite Monastery where she was prayed over by nuns.She also had private breakfast with Ilocos Norte first District Rep. Rodolfo Fariñas before proceeding to the Northwestern University for a forum with students.During the forum, Robredo clarified her stand on martial law and the Marcos family.“I think it’s not right to call me anti-Marcos. I am just proud that I’m the only candidate who stood against martial law,” she said.Robredo also said that she has nothing personal against the Marcoses.“I just think it’s time for us to move on. But we cannot move on if past mistakes are unsettled,” she said.Robredo said if Marcos will not say sorry for the crimes committed during martial law, at least he should recognize that some mistakes happened during those days.source from: http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/03/18/1564256/no-warm-welcome-leni-marcos-countryCommentscomments",

Vicente Sotto likewise voiced his support for Duterte’s war on illegal drugs.“Whatever it takes to take down the scourge of illegal drugs,” Sotto said in text message.Duterte spelled out on Tuesday night his strategy for curbing the drug menace in the country in six months.He said he would put up the remainder of his campaign funds as a bounty for police and military officials who neutralize drug suspects “dead or alive.”He offered up the following rates: P3 million for a drug lord; P2 million for a distributor; P1 million for a “second echelon” syndicate member, and P50,000 for an “ordinary” pusher.Sen. Panfilo Lacson is ready to support President-elect Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, going so far as to donate his unspent campaign funds toward the bounty law enforcers would be paid when they capture or kill drug suspects.He said there was enough left over from his campaign funds “for 100 persons dead.”Suspects who put up resistance during their arrest would be killed, while those who raise their hands in surrender would be spared, he added.Lacson, said Duterte’s strategy was a “clear demonstration of his determination to end a scourge that has grown to alarming proportions in recent years.”“Provided the law enforcement authorities do not go beyond the rule of law in carrying out his marching orders… I am in full support of his approach to accomplish what he promised before he was elected and now that he is waiting to be sworn into office,” said Lacson,But he stressed that the police should not be motivated by the reward to do their job, “but solely by an unequivocal compliance with the President’s directive, not to mention their mandate to perform their sworn duty to protect the people and maintain a peaceful and orderly society.”“I myself am willing to contribute from whatever unspent campaign contributions I still have to his pool of funds if only to underscore the importance of a concerted all-out war against drugs,” Lacson said, adding that he would check how much money he still had with his campaign finance officer.SOURCE: INQUIRECommentscomments",

    "body": "Richard Poon: 'If one day you come FACE-TO-FACE with real EVIL, believe me, you will CALL DUTERTE for help'Many say their reasons to pick a Presidentiable are: Diplomacy, Economic growth/Business interests, Strategic Planning/Platforms, and a gazillion other VALID REASONS. IF YOUR PRIMARY REASON to elect a President is ECONOMIC/BUSINESS INTERESTS and DIPLOMACY, Mar Roxas should be a good, safe bet.But ABOVE all these important elements, I believe the PRIMARY ROLE of Government is to RESTRAIN EVIL, PROMOTE SOCIAL ORDER, and GIVE JUSTICE to its people.—this belief is fueled heavily by writings of Chuck Colson—a Christian leader that served in the White House(whom Ninoy Aquino sought as spiritual mentor.Primary role of Government, Apostle Paul, Romans 13 mentioned in “Kingdoms in Conflict” by Chuck Colson.Years ago, I was skeptical at Duterte. I heard rumors that he was a feared “berdugo”(executioner of criminals). Curfews at night. No smoking in certain areas, Liquor bans. Maximum 40 kph on the road???!!!But unknowingly, my MANY TRIPS TO DAVAO to sing for many years OPENED UP CONVERSATIONS with the people there. I was shocked yet CURIOUSLY AMAZED that taxi drivers, ordinary employees LOVE & RESPECT him! In their own words, Duterte was THE EXACT OPPOSITE of the MANY ACCUSATIONS.Many say this is because the Mayor PROTECTED THEM FROM EVIL.In my circles, most of the people who judge Duterte as an ill leader have NEVER BEEN TO DAVAO to witness his reforms first-hand.And if Duterte’s ways are really off, will not Davao and the surrounding Muslim world rebel and oust him even in earlier days?I must admit, WITHOUT MY MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE FROM DAVAO, I would not realize who Duterte really is. So from my heart, thank you so much Davaoenos for showing me Duterte’s truth in real everyday life.Perfection is out of the question. All Presidentiables don’t have every single person rooting for him/her. If you have some intelligence groups, you’ll know that INSIDE the same party, politicians that dislike each other ARE FAKING smiles onstage & on TV commercials….even holding hands for shared goals:)I put this argument on the shelf, as it is a waste of time. The voices of the majority of Davao, the surrounding Muslim areas, and the militant groups in Mindanao are clear on Duterte.My conscience finds it difficult to join those who say “Duterte will never be able to do that—-curb crime in 3 to 6 months!”. So if that’s true, WHERE WILL I GO? To Mar Roxas who promises to MAINTAIN/CONTINUE “Daang Matuwid”?I love President Noynoy Aquino for the LIFT he gave our country from the previous regime, but until today our issues on transportation systems (from the MRT to the Airport) are still in a mess, with VERY MINIMUM ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE WRONG. Wanna check Yolanda funds for accountability?Or how many have you seen convicted of hazing deaths? ZERO. Powerful government officials(belonging to the same fraternities) fly the murderers out of the country until we all forget. You won’t forget if the hazing death is your son.When you pay steep taxes and CANNOT see a simple walkalator operate in your own airport, or roads repeatedly break into potholes after moderate rain…Isn’t it true, what foreigners say, that most government transactions require some form of “under the table” fees to get through the RED TAPE? And since rules are not consistently enforced, DOING THE WRONG THING (bribes, tax evasion, counterflow traffic, littering, etc.) IS EASIER compared to doing the right thing?Have you been robbed? Does our present government protect you well and give just punishment to the robber? Do you feel safe? Do CCTV footages just show you HOW POWERLESS WE ARE AGAINST CRIME?Are the people who ran away with money in pyramid scams, estafa, etc. jailed for good when they victimize you? Or do they GO FREE inspite of you paying lawyers to do their best?And if criminals are successfully jailed, is it true that they become “kings” in Bilibid prison with money-making businesses like cooking shabu?I am voting for Duterte because he DID IT IN THE MICRO(Davao). I saw him change what many(including myself)thought to be UNCHANGEABLE—-the corrupt system of governance.So I will put my hopes and faith that Duterte will do THE SAME in the MACRO(whole Philippines). Even if he takes more than 6 months, I’ll still support him. Rather than ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO of governance, crime, corruption and drugs.Isn’t it ironic that Duterte—-who has DRASTICALLY CHANGED the CROOKED SYSTEM in micro Davao—- is being trashed by some as a joke in favor of those WHO HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED CORRUPT GOVERNANCE? And some expect these people to run MACRO Philippines?I have to give a clap for Duterte opponents trying to DISTORT him being a tough, fearless, disciplinarian father THAT DAVAO LOVES & RESPECTS into a tyrant who will take away your candy, be like Marcos, choke you into Martial Law, and kill a law-abiding citizen like yourself.If one day you come FACE-TO-FACE WITH REAL EVIL(murder, rape, robbery), believe me, you will CALL DUTERTE for help.I’ll say it again: P-Noy has lifted us up, but there is STILL SO MUCH THAT I DON’T WANT MAINTAINED or CONTINUED in “Daang Matuwid.”I believe this country deserves BETTER—-someone to RAISE THE STANDARD HIGHER.I also do NOT agree with those who say “do not vote for Duterte because he is a womanizer and he curses a lot…” Maybe to them THE PRIMARY ROLE of governance is a SQUEAKY CLEAN MORAL IMAGE or DIPLOMATIC EXCELLENCE. If that’s the case, Grace Poe and Mar Roxas can easily fit those roles.But if you, like me, believe that THE PRIMARY ROLE of government is to RESTRAIN and PUNISH EVIL, GIVE BACK JUSTICE to the Filipinos who are so tired of living without it, then Duterte is your ONLY CHOICE.I will NOT choose another candidate OUT OF FEAR OF DUTERTE. I choose Duterte out of strong FAITH in him.I say, Go Duterte, give the Philippines hope in CHANGING THE EVIL WE HAVE BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO!“I would rather have FAITH in what Duterte has accomplished, HOPE in what he CAN do, than SETTLE for his opponents in FEAR of the “monster” he “could” become. (And some say he already IS.)”Source: Facebook | Excerpts from Richard and Maricar Poon’s published note on April 15 /Commentscomments",

    "body": "Troops from the 401st Infantry (Unity) Brigade captured what was believed to be the regional headquarters of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)-New People’s Army (NPA) Northeastern Mindanao Regional Command (NEMRC), according to the military.In an interview with The Manila Bulletin yesterday, Capt. Rodulfo S. Cordero, Civil Military Operations (CMO) officer and spokesperson of the 401st Brigade, confirmed that the brigade overran the 1,000-square meter camp located in the mountainous and forested Anday Valley Complex in San Agustin, Surigao del Sur.He said the capture of the regional headquarters of the NEMRC was the offshoot of the massive and wide pursuit operations of troops after they encountered NPA terrorists last November 28, 2017.“Some sporadic gunbattle also took place where two NPA terrorists were killed until our pursuing troops captured the NEMRC encampment,” claimed the 401st Brigade spokesperson and CMO officer.“The seized camp is complete with barricade, water system and several listening posts strategically located on the high ground in the forested mountain,” he said.Cordero added the NPA camp can accommodate up to 200 persons, and is equipped with an electric generator, has makeshift houses, tents, water source and communication facilities, including cellular phone signal boosters used for their communications.During the clearing operations yesterday, troops seized several Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), M203 and M79 grenade launchers, assemblies for M14 and M16 rifles, several live 60mm mortars, rifle grenades, volt and spring of M60 machine gun, eight hand held radios, anti-government documents and the CPP and NPA flags, Cordero said.Col. Andres C. Centino, commanding officer of the “Fighting and Unity” 401st Brigade, said that based on reports and recovered documents, the communist terrorists belonging to the NEMRC planned to use the IEDs recovered by the operating troops to attack the Villeneuve troops, business establishments and civilian targets to highlight the CPP anniversary on December 26 this year.source #Mandirigma #SupportOurTroopsCommentscomments",

All three men are carrying Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) identification cards.KMU main office in Quezon City earlier today confirmed that the three men are among their officials stationed in Mindoro Occidental, but did not comment about the money.The Calapan Port Security on Saturday received a tip from undisclosed source that the New People’s Army (NPA) in Occidental Mindoro is expecting a large sum of money from metro Manila, and could be possibly delivered through hand carry.None of the three arrested members of militant labor group speak about why they carry such big amount of money and where to deliver.No case was filed against the three apprehended men, but the police said they will not be released until AMLC (Anti-money Laundering Council) give clearance.Since the KMU has connection with the rebel NPA, police are suspecting that the money is intended for the NPA operating in Mindoro Island.The money obviously did not appear to be come from any bank at it was not organized well, and only bundled with rubber bands.KMU main office has refused to comment about the money as of press time. /Jane Salgado/Commentscomments",

Sotto said it is still not clear who between them will ultimately vie for the leadership.Cayetano is the running mate of incoming President Rodrigo Duterte while Pimentel is the President of PDP-Laban, the political party of Duterte. The two allied senators are both gunning for the senate presidency but Pimentel earlier said that it will be a “friendly competition”18 SenatorsSotto said on Monday, May 30, that their group consists of 18 senators, hinting that some of those who committed to Cayetano have committed to them as well.“Ang pirma sa isang resolusyon, pirma ‘yon until approval. Eh kung nakapirma rin sa ibang resolusyon? (A signature on a resolution, that’s a signature until the approval. What if the person also signed another resolution?) It negates everything else,” Sotto said.“Eighteen kami. Commitment? Madali ‘yung commitment (Commitment is easy). I would not be surprised if any of the other SP (Senate president) aspirants would say that they have commitments. everybody has commitment, it’s easy to commit, the importantt thing is when you vote,” Sotto added.Pimentel, for his part, admitted he is interested in gunning for the top Senate post. After all, he said, it is his “duty and obligation” as PDP-Laban president to try to become the chamber leader.“I might get their support if I can convince them on federalism. We are talking because we have to agree based on principles. We should be change-minded senators so we’re talking about federalism,” he said.15 SenatorsCayetano claimed he has the commitment of 15 senators to be the next Senate president. But, so far, only one has signed the resolution declaring him the next chamber leader – senator-elect Manny Pacquiao, who, Sotto said, also committed to their group.Pacquiao was the first one to sign Cayetano’s resolution on Sunday, May 29.“There are about 15 that have committed, but, as I said, the voting is not today. But I believe, if personal commitment is given…. But, of course, there’s a lot of talking, a lot of persuasion,” Cayetano said in a chance interview with reporters on Monday, May 30“Private ‘yon (resolution), binuo namin. Commitments are there, but the actual signatures will depend sa paalaman sa bawat grupo nila (on their own permissions from their groups). But then di ko naman plinano sa harap ng media yon magkapirmahan. It wasn’t really for the public,” he added.Sen. Franklin Drilon is the incumbent senate president and will remain so if there’s no majority vote.Source : PICKJUANCommentscomments",

    "body": "An oft-quoted saying once read, “The world is your playground.” But for the “Catwalk King” Sinon Loresca, the world is actually his runway, and he never misses any chance to do a sexy strut in platform heels!According to a GMA News report, Sinon was on his way the beautiful island of Boracay to celebrate the holidays, but with an early flight to catch, how do you stay awake at such an ungodly hour? Well, by doing a catwalk, of course!On Instagram, the social media celebrity shared three video clips of him sashaying in platform heels while skimpily clad in a barely there white dress. Dubbed as his “most emotional” catwalk yet, Sinon was a vision in his chiseled, Adonis-like body…but in nine-inch heels.What made the walk “emotional” was the background tune of Gary Valenciano’s “Pasko Na, Sinta Ko”, as Sinon tapped into his feelings while delivering a healthy serving of sauciness in his strut.Even bystanders stopped and watched Sinon as he confidently conquered the stretch inside the Terminal 3 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) prior to boarding his plane. Mind you, the Catwalk King didn’t just fiercely walk; he also turned and twirled while viewers watch with bated breath if something will “peek out” of Sinon’s muscular legs. Fortunately, there was no “sighting”.Nowadays, Sinon is a regular on the Kalyeserye segment of the longest-running noontime, Eat Bulaga, as Rogelia, the gay bodyguard. But before entering local showbiz, Sinon first became an Internet sensation when he did a “Miss Universe” sexy strut in blue bikini bottom that turned viral. In fact, international media took notice of Sinon and gave him the title of “Catwalk King”.In a previous episode of GMA-7’s drama anthology, Magpakailanman, Sinon revealed that he has a British husband whom he left back in United Kingdom. Speaking to host Mel Tiangco, he said, “Kasal po kami ng asawa ko doon sa London, legal po kami.”Despite the distance and time difference, his husband remains supportive of his growing career. “Nagbakasyon lang po siya nung December. Kaaalis lang niya ng January,” he explained. “So, binibisita naman niya ako kasi sinuportahan niya talaga ako.”What can you say about Sinon Loresca ‘s “emotional” catwalk? Was is it undoubtedly fierce? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!",

    "body": "Voters in Catalonia faced a momentous choice in elections Thursday for their regional parliament: either support political parties that are determined to keep up the pressure to turn their region into Europe’s newest country, or opt for those that want it to stay as part of Spain.The pivotal election is aimed at breaking the bitter deadlock over the issue of secession. But neither side is likely to win a clear majority in the new regional parliament, setting up the scenario of long and challenging negotiations to form a new Catalan government.Opinion polls have shown fugitive and jailed separatist candidates neck-and-neck in opinion polls with unionists, who claim to be in the best position to return Catalonia to stability and growth.But with a record turnout expected, the outcome could hinge on the more than one-fifth who are undecided among Catalonia’s 5.5 million eligible voters.The nearly 2,700 polling stations will remain open until 8 p.m. local time, with results expected a few hours later.Weeks of campaigning involved little debate about regional policy on issues such as public education, health or housing. At the heart of the battle was the sensational recent independence push that brought Spain’s worst political crisis in decades.Separatist regional lawmakers made a unilateral declaration of independence on Oct. 27, prompting Spain’s national government to take the dramatic step of firing the regional government and dissolving the Catalan parliament. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called an early election, which he is hoping will keep the separatists out of power.People queue to vote in Catalonia’s regional elections at a polling station in Barcelona, Spain on Thursday. (Jon Nazca/Reuters)The strategy could backfire, however, if the election delivers a pro-independence majority of lawmakers in the Catalan parliament. Even so, Rajoy says Catalan independence would go against the Spanish Constitution and he refuses to accept the possibility. The separatists, including a fugitive former leader evading Spanish authorities in Brussels and another campaigning from a jail near Madrid, are equally uncompromising.A Catalan attempt to secede would be an unwelcome development for the European Union, which is already wrestling with legal complications from Britain’s planned exit from the bloc. Senior EU officials have backed Rajoy, and no EU country has offered support for the separatists.Catalonia’s independence ambitions also have scant support in the rest of Spain.",

The situation nowadays is a far cry from previous times and the AFP resolve to stand by the Republic and its institutions should not be doubted,” Año said.“As the Commander-in-Chief himself said, the AFP’s loyalty must not be based on personalities but rather to the people and the flag. He further reiterated that the AFP must always focused on its Constitutionally mandated duties and work for the interest of the people and the nation. Soldiers will not allow themselves to be distracted from this,” he added.Earlier, Duterte revealed that some mining executives are funding the opposition’s destabilization plot against him.He said that mining executives are actively funding the destabilization plot.The President added that even foreign personalities, particularly Americans, are helping the mining executives fund his administration’s destabilization.

This girl is no other than Serena Dalrymple.Loading...Serena rose to stardom when she became one of the cast members in several films alongside famous actors such like Red Ford White, Babalu, and Dolphy; and she actually won the 1997 FAMAS awards as the Best Child Actress in the film, “Bata Bata Paano ka Ginawa?” with the award-winning actress, Vilma Santos. After her TVC, her career skyrocketed at a very young age.She retired showbiz in 2008, in her last movie titled, “Tanging Ina” where she played the role of Kate, a daughter of Ai Ai Delas Alas.Then in 2010, she finished her degree in Business Administration at the College of St. Benilde. After that, she flew to the US to join her siblings, and to receive the benefits of her deceased father, who worked as a Military Officer in the United States.Serena continued to search for her purpose, thus, she decided to pursue her graduate studies in International Business. She then travelled to London, and she enrolled herself in Hult International Business School in the year 2013. She finished her master’s degree after one year.After earning her master’s degree in business in London, she went to California to work as a Sourcing Analyst for Paramount Pictures.She transferred to a popular network called Viacom, and worked there as a manager in 2016.She would possibly retire from the industry after 14 years, however, she still makes time to meet some of her showbiz friends such as Camille Prats, Rica Peralejo, and Angelica Panganiban.Today, she is keeping herself busy with reading books, and doing landscape photography. During her recent interview, she said that she does not have any plans of returning to the showbiz industry.Serena is now enjoying her time abroad and she is making the most out of it. Since, she is living there with her other family members, she believes that she still has a lot to learn, experience, and discover. She is still young, thus, greater things are still ahead of her. Surely, after several years of working in the US, she had left her mark in the business industry. No doubt that she had performed very well and was able to support her family’s needs as well.She will always be remembered in the showbiz industry for being the very cute, tiny, and naughty girl. Her roles were indeed effective as she was able to embody such endearing and funny roles. Her naughtiness always made it a point to make the film viewers laugh their brains out whenever she executes her clever plans.Don’t we just love her? She has branded herself in a very memorable and remarkable way at a very young age. Many child actors and actresses surely look up to her as she insipires more and more children who likes to pursue the acting career.",

In a video posted last December 18, Xian claims that the video was posted on his official page because he instructed his page administrator to do so after he boarded a plane out of the country. He explained that he made this video because there was a PHP 5 million bounty on his head put out by a ‘certain syndicate‘, which was why he had to flee. His opening statement was:“If you are watching this video right now, it means na na-upload na siya ng admin ko as per my instruction. And at the jjnnmoment nasa loob na ko ng eroplano boarding, getting out of the country para magtago muna because I have a 5 million pesos bounty on my head, dead or alive, by a certain syndicate.“Xian then went on to explain the purpose of his viral video, and why he chose to post it online instead of bringing it to the proper authorities. He said he was scared that the matter might get concealed if the authorities were involved in the ‘mega scam‘ that he was about to talk about.He said:“In this video I won’t be talking about bitcoin as a market, as a crypto currency, or as a global trend or as an investment. What I’ll be talking about is the mega scam behind it here in the Philippines by a group of people. I will show you later how this scam works. Uhm, bakit hindi nalang ako lumapit sa authorities? Ipakita sa kanila or gawin ‘tong exposé na ‘to? Because I’m afraid na baka ma-conceal lang and hindi lumabas ito because you know money matters.”He explained that he became part of it a few months ago when ‘they’ approached him. Xian admitted that he contributed his ideas, knowledge, and even resources to create the whole system. However, he said that he did not expect to be a victim of the scam itself. According to Xian, Php 34 million was embezzled from him. The said amount was not his, but rather, his investors’ who entrusted him with their money. He explained:“I feel like I became part of it because a few months ago, knowing me, knowing me, they approached me. And we had a series of meeting and nakapag contribute ako ng ideas, knowledge, and even gave certain uhm resources and connections with the entire system with the entire scheme na nakakalungkot isipin na the system where I somehow become co-creator. Ako mismo ay naging biktima nito. Because I took 34 million pesos from multiple investors and they took it from me. So wala. That’s why nandito ako ngayon, doing this media, doing this exposé.”Xian then proceeded to explain the whole scheme behind the Bitcoin scam. He claims that a certain syndicate is behind all the Bitcoin operations here in the Philippines. While Bitcoin in itself is not a scam, he alleges that the syndicate uses it as a front to lure people into ‘investing‘ – believing that their money was going into Bitcoin. As more people ‘invest’, they ‘see’ that their money is growing, so they don’t cash it out. They don’t even try to get their initial capital. Instead, they use the interest they earn to re-invest in order to earn more money.However, Xian claims that this is the scam. As the pool of money grows and no one cashes out, the syndicate liquidates it by laundering the money to foreign companies which earn 10% of the total amount. They then keep the said money for themselves. He warned that this scam will not last forever; it will soon burst and the investors will be left with nothing.After his explanation of the ‘mega scam’, he explained again why he made the said video:“The question now is bakit ko ginawa itong exposé na ‘to? What’s my purpose? Kailangan ko lang ba ng publicity or whatsoever? I’ll be straightforward. My life is falling apart now. Ang daming problema. For the past 2 to 3 months, depression stage ako, financially hirap na hirap because you know the 34 million na nagkaproblema recently. Because my personal investors siyempre naghahabol din with the money, domino effect.”Xian added that he had to send his son away to protect him and keep him safe. He said that the video was intended to serve as his ‘redemption’ from all the evil things he has done in the past:“I feel like exposing this one is a redemption to myself. After all the wrongdoings na nagawa ko, even yung na-expose ako before as a scammer. They called me a national scammer because you know marami din akong nagawang mali sa buhay ko I’ll be honest. And I feel like I need to stand up now against this evil shit that I’ve been doing.”He then closed the video with these last words:“For the first time in my life in how many years I did the right thing.” “I hope madami akong masalbang pamilya na pwedeng gumuho because of this scam, buhay na masira because of this scam.”Xian S. Gaza first gained infamy when he asked actress Erich Gonzales out on a coffee date using a billboard earlier this year. He captured the imagination of the country as he was portrayed as the rich, young, CEO of his own company who merely wanted a date with Erich. However, he was soon exposed as a ‘scammer’ and a ‘fake’ by ex-business partners and people he has dealt with in the past. Xian then became known as the “national scammer”.In the posted video, however, Xian claims that he wants to help out the families and individuals who might get scammed by the syndicate he was referring to. He even commented on his video:“Take it from the “National Scammer” himself. If about your medical health, you consult a doctor. If about engineering, you look for engineers. If something to do with science, you need a scientist. So if you need to know about scam…?”Despite all this, a lot of netizens were still wary of the video and everything that Xian S. Gaza said in it.Watch the whole video here:BITCOIN SCAM EXPOSÉ BY XIAN S. GAZA​ BITCOIN SCAM EXPOSÉ by \"National Scammer\" Xian S.

Mamamayang mapangabuso sa bayan ni Juan! Yan ang bansag sa mga bagong kabataan ng Unibeesidad ng Pilipinas! Nakakahiya kayo sa bansang sinilangan!”Netizen Harly Bale remarked.“Yan ba ang produkto ng tax na binabayad ng taong bayan? Imbes na kung ano anong kalokohan ang gawin nyo tumanaw kayo ng utang na loob sa mga nag papaaral sa inyo sa pamamagitan ng pag babahagi ng inyong natutunan sa kursong napili nyo at tulungan ang bayan na umunlad.” Netizen Paolo Cordero said.“Akala ko UP mga sobrang bait ng mga estudyante..mabuti pa mga pupils ko kahit larawan lang kahit sinong Presidente,respetuhin nila..bakit ganun..nasaan na ba ang tinuturong VALUES EDUCATION sa atin..lalo na kayong taga UP ang talino daw..”MABUTI PANG HINDI MASYADONG MATALINO BASTA MAY RESPETO SA KAPWA TAO”. Teacher Eb-eb Nah Quo said.“Such a disgrace. Never thought that these supposed intellectuals are capable of such a mockery of themselves. If this is the result of freedom, then a dictatorship is beginning to sound appealing to me.” Netizen Jupiter Nacario said.Charles Kevin Absalon said that the reaction of the public on the 2017 lampoon edition of the Philippine Collegian proves how gullible are the Filipinos when it comes on reading satirical and fictional writings.“Dito natin malalaman kung sino ang mga taong madali maloko ng satirical pieces, fictional writings, fake news at mga hoax. Dito rin natin malalaman kung sino ang may hindi alam sa ibig sabihin o theme ng lampoon.” he said.In 2011, a former editor-in-chief of the UP Baguio Outcrop, the official publication of U.P Baguio was charged by libel for its supposedly libelous article against a UPB journalist professor. The Baguio City RTC Branch 6 junked the libel case against the U.P Student in 2016.",

Alexis Fabrero, who resides at Sitio Apartahan Barangay Tigwi, Torrijos, Marinduque recited the poem he wrote in front of a cellphone camera while standing on a mound of dirt in their vegetable garden brandishing a machete on his hip for effect.The video quickly gained traction as many social media users find his poem both impressive and inspiring. He delivered the poem like a classic poet pouring emotions to each and every word complete with gestures.The machete he wore on his hip, which he uses to help his father work their vegetable garden, only gave a nationalistic effect to his recital which of many us found amusing.According to report by Marinduque News, a local website in that province, Alexis is a grade 3 student in elementary and is a consistent honor student in his class.The young poet wishes to have the opportunity to shake hands with the president as a gift for his upcoming birthday on August 6. He also wanted to ask for a scholarship for his two younger siblings as well as for himself. Marinduque News reports that the video of Alexis reciting his heartfelt poem has already been viewed over a million times and garnered almost 30 thousand shares and counting as of this writing.Aside from having the chance to shake the hands of the president, he also wanted a tablet for his birthday prompting the the editors of Marinduque News to open a donation drive where netizens may donate so that they may buy him a present.Here's the video of Alexis Fabrero, now dubbed as Batang Makata ng Bayan, reciting his poem for President Duterte, followed by the full transcript below:“Magandang araw po, sa taga It’s ShowtimeLalo kay Ate Vice, sa inyong lahat diyanAko ay nagsadya, sa inyong harapanUpang makiusap, ako ay payaganTula sa pangulo dito sa programa, kanyang mapakinggan.Magandang araw po, kagalang-galanganMahal na pangulong, kapitag-pitaganSa sandaling ito, sa’yo po’y nagpupugay.Ako po ay batang, taga MarinduqueHinubog sa aral at gawang mabutiMay takot sa Diyos sa droga’y tumanggiBawal magpasaway, ng hindi magsisi.Sa aking panonood, ng mga balitaAking namamasdan, ang inyong mga mukhaSa loob at labas, nitong ating bansaAking namamalas, ang inyo pong mga gawa.Sa murang isip ko, akin pong nalamanKayo ang pangulong, mabait matapangPuso’y maawain, laging mapagbigaySa lahat ng taong, nangangailangan.Subali’t kung taong matigas ang uloSa bayan ay pasaway, ayaw magbagoLipulin ang salot, sakit ng gobyerno.Ako po ay kampi, sa inyo ay panigAlam kong tama lang, parusang ginamitKung hindi gagawin, kastigong makisigMas lalong darami, mga taong adik.Para po sa akin, bilang isang bataSa aking paglaki, paligid ko’y payapaSaan man magpunta, makisalamuhaSaan mang panig, sulok nitong bansa.Kaya salamat po, sa pagmamalasakitLipulin ang salot, sa aming paligidKami ay mamuhay, ng walang ligaligPuno ng pangarap, payapa’t tahimik.Ako po ay mayroon, isang kahilinganNa dapat idulog, sa inyong harapanBilang pagkilala, sa inyong tagumpayNais kong personal, kayong makamayan.Kung mangyari iyon, sa’kin ay biyayaNa dapat ipagbunyi, ng isip ko’t diwaItong Pilipinas ay malayang bansaLahat pantay pantay, may isang bandila.Sa aking pagtanda, di ko lilimutinNa isang pangulong, nagmulat sa akinAkoy magtiwala, sa kanyang layuninSiya’y inspirasyon, saan man makarating.Kaya salamat po, ako’y pinakingganBinigyang pansin, tula kong inialaySa isang pangulong, dangal nitong bayan.Salamat Ate Vice sa iyong kabaitanAking habilin, pusong nagmamahalIka’y mayakap, ng buong paggalangRegalo mong tablet, aking iingatan.Share this article if you think this kid deserves to meet President Duterte.",

    "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte revealed during his arrival statement following his state visits to Cambodia and Singapore that the woman that he saved from 3 kidnappers is now a Doctor.During a press conference in Davao International Airport on December 16, he explained why he must kill the criminals in Davao City during his early years as Mayor.According to him, kidnapping was rampant in Davao City during his early months and every Davaoños knew that.He narrated how he and his men saved the life of a woman who is now a doctor from her kidnappers.“I was only three months mayor in 1988. Alam ninyong taga-Davao. You know, all Davaoeños know that. They were picking victims right in the middle of the downtown area. Sa [uyangco?] rin dinampot nila yung babae kasama yung boyfriend. They were just into this…there used to be a Betamax, you have to go to an outlet and rent one. They just picked up the woman and brought her to Cotabato and they detained her for 2 months. One day, they sent feelers of… to the family and she’s still alive. She is now a doctor, the woman…sent feelers to the parents that they were going to surrender or return the hostage, I don’t want to mention the name. Sabi nila in exchange for 2 million not to tell the police but the parents whispered to me.So, on that fateful night, they were travelling. I was there with retired police Elson Estares and two others because they never expected that they would pass this way but they would return. It is not done. Usually if you pass in this area, you pass only once. You do not go back and…but the troops were there surrounding the house. So when we heard somebody inside, he’s a brave guy, Lima, he was the one I told. You go there because he was a shooter. I said could you take out three persons at one time, he said yes.When the firefight started and Duterte already knew that the criminals were ready to kill and to die, he grabbed his m16 to finish them off.Okay you will be that inside the bedroom. And when she said the birdie, “birdie” is safe. So they went down and it was covered by the televisions. The networks were just at the background. So, when they refused to stop, we saw a carbine pointed at us. We were parked nearby. So, the shooting started and I was one holding a…I was holding a .45 but you know, when I saw them coming back to our direction, I grabbed my M16, American-made, mind you…to kill criminals. Not extrajudicial, there was a firefight. And I said there were about only three of us there.He lambasted the people who criticized him for his admission that he killed criminals and told them that he’s only doing his job to protect the people of Davao.So, I might have hit them all or none at all. But the fact is I was there and I fired at them. It was a pure case of kidnapping. It happened during my first term in 1988. And here comes an idiot—always an idiot almost all of them are, saying that my admission, that I shot the suspect, they were not suspect. You idiotic. I don’t know from where you are. To us I was not a suspect, I was in a shootout and many others in my career of the 23 years. I am a mayor that cannot tolerate oppression of civilians, and many others and small encounters. Another kidnap-killing I was there. It also resulted in a shootout. The family was a…the wife of a small mall here in the city. So what’s wrong in being, you are pictured to be a killer.So, at least I killed to protect people. I am not here a dictator killing my political opponents to stay in power.”Duterte said that he only kill to protect the oppressed people of his city where criminality where rampant during the 1980’s before he became a Mayor.",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Wednesday, February 26th, 2014A quad, or quadruple, is a figure skating jump with four or more, but fewer than five, revolutions.The Axel jump, named after its originator Axel Paulsen, is an edge jump launched on the forward outside edge and landed on the back outside edge of the opposite foot.Now, combining the two above, a quadruple Axel jump is the most difficult jump in figure skating, in fact so difficult that no one has ever landed one successfully in the history of Figure Skating, either during practice, exhibition or competition.That is until last Sunday, well sort of.Michael Christian Martinez, the only Filipino athlete at the 2014 Olympics, received a hero’s welcome in Manila on Sunday. The 17-year-old athlete arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport around 5 p.m. and was taken to the SM Mall of Asia via motorcade for a program in his honor.After the program, the Filipino Olympian treated his fans to a skating exhibition, demonstrating his Olympic-caliber prowess that earned him a spot to compete with the world’s best.After the exhibition, Martinez was heard screaming with joy as he skated back to his mom and his coach, asking “Did you see that?, I did it!, Do you see it?”“I did a quad Axel!,” Martinez exclaimed.His mom and coach simply stared in bewilderment, wondering how they missed such a historic event.Asking around, Eritas Times discovered that the crowd’s attention was drawn away from Martinez at the precise moment, and none of the hundreds of people present to watch Martinez saw the jump.It turns out that popular actor Piolo Pascual showed up near the ice rink, pulling away the attention from Martinez.Sadly, all we have to show is a photo of the jump (inset) taken a couple of seconds after Martinez landed the quad Axel, and when the crowd turned their attention back to him again.I guess we’ll just have to take Martinez’ word on it.",

    "body": "What if in a galaxy not so far, far away and at time not at all long ago, the fantasy technology of Star Wars was real?What if, here and now, you could use the force? That would probably change things for you and the boss around the office.Or what if you could rip through foes with a lightsaber. Or had an R2D2 or a C3PO of your own to help you knock things off your to-do list?Thanassis Psaltis, a graduate student in Nuclear Astrophysics at McMaster University in Hamilton, has studied the science of Star Wars. He spoke with the CBC’s Conrad Collaco about how close modern science is to building a lightsaber or R2D2 and answered many other questions about Star Wars science in the modern world.You can listen to the full conversation by clicking on the image at the top of this page or read an edited and abridged transcript on the page below.Thanassis Psaltis, McMaster University nuclear astrophysicist Thanassis Psaltis is an astrophysicist from McMaster University. (Athanasios Psaltis)What made you want to look at the science behind Star Wars?Star Wars has been a flagship of pop culture for at least four decades. Its audience spans a wide range of ages. Science fiction provides a unique opportunity to talk about real science. Star Wars is the best playground to do that since it’s so popular, especially with kids.This lightsaber was used by Kylo Ren and was first seen in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. (Disney)How close are we to building a real lightsaber?The name is a bit unfortunate because they’re not made out of light and don’t have a sabre shape. Light beams do not interact with each other so you couldn’t have the usual fight we see in the movies. They are not laser swords as George Lucas likes to say in interviews. But as I argue in my Planetarium show we could use plasma, the fourth state of matter, to create lightsabers. Gas, liquids and solids are the other three states of matter. Plasma is an ionized gas, a very hot gas. You could imagine it as a hot soup of atoms and electrons.You could use plasma to build a lightsaber, however plasma is very difficult to handle. You would need very strong magnetic fields to create the sword shape. The good thing about the plasma is that it can explain the colours of the lightsaber. Different kinds of gasses, different plasma, can create different colours. We can get exactly the same colours we see in the movies.A planet circling two suns much like Tatooine, the planet of Luke Skywalker’s birth, was discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope in 2011. (Disney)What about the planets we’ve come to know in Star Wars like the desert world Tatooine with its two suns. Is there a planet out there like there like where Luke Skywalker grew up?There is actually. The amazing fact is that when the planet was first introduced to the audience in 1977 there was no observational evidence of such planets. A couple of years ago a space telescope called Kepler, which is dedicated to look for exoplanets, planets not located in our own solar system, found a planet now called Kepler-16b, which is rotating around two suns.McMaster University astrophysicist Thanassis Psaltis says your Death Star would need about 2.3 percent of the Sun’s energy in a year to blow up the Earth. (Disney)That’s pretty cool that a planet with two suns, the type that only existed in the imagination of George Lucas in 1977, has now been found to exist in the known universe.Yeah. That’s amazing. In fact, George Lucas said in an interview a couple of years ago that when he was making Star Wars he wasn’t restrained by any kind of science. He said ‘I just made a world that was fun and had a reality to it.’ But we see that four decades after the first movie there was a lot of science.That’s an interesting idea — that what we may come to discover in the future about our world through scientific investigation may only exist now in our imagination. What do you think about that?That’s what science fiction does. It provokes the mind, even for scientists like us. It’s also really useful for people to appreciate and respect science.Of course the most powerful weapon in the Star Wars universe is the Death Star. How much energy would the Death Star require to destroy Earth? I’m asking for a friend.Quite a lot, actually. Tell your friend. It’s easy to calculate the amount of energy to destroy the Earth with a Death Star. It’s a number with almost 35 zeroes. It’s equal to about 2.3 per cent of the energy the sun produces every year. The sun produces energy every second that is equal to 1 billion times the energy humans consume in one year. A mind-blowing amount of energy.So, if we could harness a fraction of the sun’s power, a Death Star might be real?That’s really, really hard to do right now.The droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) appears alongside Luke Skywalker in 1977’s ‘Star Wars.’ (AP photo)How close are humans to creating robots like R2D2 and C3PO?Not really far, I would say. We have sent robots like R2D2 to other planets like the Curiosity rover, a small robot that is working around the surface of Mars right now taking samples and sending the data back to scientists at NASA. And something similar to C3PO is a droid called Asimov, which is made by Honda. It’s an interesting robot that has really nice features. It doesn’t say we’re doomed all the time but it’s pretty good.Now, the idea of the Force – an energy that seems to connect all living things in the galaxy and can be used for good or evil – is something philosophers have contemplated for years. Is there science behind it?The Force is kind of something that exists in the universe, not as Star Wars and George Lucas have introduced it to us. We are all connected to the universe because we are all made of exactly the same material. Everything that makes us up contains the building blocks of matter, the atoms, and were forged billions of years ago in the very heart of the stars. We are all connected to the universe. We are a living part of it. We are made of star stuff as Carl Sagan said.We have four forces in the universe. The first one is the gravitational force. That makes the planets revolve around the sun and keeps our feet on the ground. We have the electromagnetic force and the weak and strong nuclear force that keep the atoms together. Scientists have tried to find one equation or theory to unify all these forces — a unified theory of everything. So far we are not there yet. The biggest theory we have so far accounts for three of the four forces excluding gravitational theory. We’re still trying to find a way to get gravity into the game.Until we can come up with a unified theory for these forces we are left to leave the idea of using the Star Wars force to our imaginations. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.That’s not bad at all. It’s great.",

    "body": "The year 2017 has so far seen its share of demonstrations of various scales and from pro- and anti-administration sides of the political fence, but for a former lawmaker, protest actions against President Rodrigo Duterte are only bound to get bigger in 2018.Former Bayan Muna party-list representative Neri Colmenares on Wednesday said he sees “larger rallies and protest actions in 2018 especially since President Duterte has not fulfilled his promises.”And it may not just be the usual set of protesters that will be opposing the President in the coming year, Duterte’s second at the helm of the Philippine government.“Maraming mga lawyers na before hindi ganun ka-vocal, pero ngayon sabi nila sobra na ‘to. So I’m sure there are many lawyers, and not just lawyers, many people, many sectors, the Church, or even business for that matter or professionals na medyo hindi na sila sang-ayon sa nangyayaring kaguluhan ngayon,” Colmenares said.Duterte, to recall, ran for and eventually won the presidency on a platform that reflected supposed disdain for illegal drugs and corruption, among others, which all apparently resonated with the 16 million Filipinos who voted for him in May 2016.But Colmenares said a part of Duterte’s base of supporters may now be “disenchanted,” since the Chief Executive has allegedly fallen short of ending contractualization, addressing land distribution, and achieving an independent foreign policy.“…Lahat ‘yan ng pangako niya will cause disenchantment even to his supporters,” he said.Lawyer Homobono Adaza, for his part, said he sees “sunrise” in 2018, but former Defense Secretary Norberto Gonzales said this “sunrise” will only be possible if a “feasible opposition” will arise.“[The] main difficulty [is] there are no alternatives that are popularly appreciated. Kasi mga alternatives natin ang more on the level of…hindi nakikita ng marami, may mga…parties; movements are there pero walang nagri-rise na pwedeng mag-galvanize ng protest,” he said.“Sunrise is possible if a feasible opposition will show up,” he added.Jigs Clamor, deputy secretary general of militant rights watchdog group Karapatan, said he is expecting a “worsened” human rights situation in the country in the coming year.Colmenares agreed, saying Duterte’s recent pronouncements, including the terror tag for the Communist Party of the Philippines – New People’s Army, and the now-Congress-approved Mindanao martial law extension, are targeted toward legal opposition to the President.Earning criticism from opposition lawmakers and non-government groups, Duterte has also openly lambasted government officials from co-equal branches of government, such as Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales and Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, who is now facing an impeachment complaint before the House Committee on Justice.The President has also spoken out against his critics in international bodies such as the United Nations and the European Union.Earlier in the forum, Colmenares called Duterte “intolerant to dissent.” —KG, GMA News",

    "body": "The government lost a nearly 30-year-long battle to recover several properties, including 67 pieces of land, allegedly purchased by the brothers of former First Lady and now Ilocos Norte Rep. Imelda Romualdez Marcos.This was after the Sandiganbayan dismissed the civil forfeiture case against Marcos’ brothers — Armando and Alfredo Romualdez.ALSO READ: THE HIDDEN TRUTH, MARCOS CASES ACQUITTEDIn a decision promulgated on August 15, a copy of which was obtained by the media Wednesday, the anti-graft court’s First Division granted the demurrer of evidence filed by Alfredo, Armando and his spouse Vilma.A demurrer to evidence seeks the dismissal of the case halfway through the trial based solely on the evidence presented by the prosecution.The subject of the forfeiture case were 67 pieces of real property located in various areas nationwide, as well as personal property composed of various shares of stock in different companies, bank accounts, vehicles, aircrafts, racehorse, and livestock.In a 76-page ruling, the Sandiganbayan said the government “miserably failed” to prove that the Romualdezes acquired the properties using government resources and obtained them because of their close relationship with the late President Ferdinand Marcos, their sister’s spouse.“[O]wnership of the properties and relations of the Romualdezes to President Marcos alone do not make these properties ill-gotten, especially considering that the Republic did not substantiate with concrete evidence abuse of power or authority on the part of the Romualdezes,” the court said.The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed the forfeiture case against the Romualdezes in 1987 to recover the properties which were allegedly acquired by the Romualdezes through illegal means.The PCGG accused the Romualdezes of allegedly conspiring with each other to create dummy corporations— Golden Country Farms Inc (GCFI)., Highway Builders Inc., Dipudo Industries Inc., Maconacon Airways Inc., and Isabela Gas and Power Develoment Corporation.These companies were allegedly used to siphon funds from the government coffers in the guise of a lone from different financial institutions such as the Development Bank of the Philippines and the National Investment Development Corp., and credit accommodations from the National Grains Authority.The monies obtained were then supposedly used for the acquisition of the properties.The government argued that the assets acquired by the Romualdez brothers should be returned to the Filipino people since they were allegedly ill-gotten.To support its case, the PCGG presented 25 witnesses and about 400 documentary exhibits from the time the complaint was filed in 1987 up until it submitted its amended formal offer of evidence in 2015.However, even with the voluminous evidence presented by the government, the Romualdezes said the case against them should be dismissed as the PCGG failed to prove the subject assets came from the government itself or were acquired through illegal means.In deciding to dismiss the case, the Sandiganbayan took issue with the documentary exhibits presented by the government to prove that GCFI was a dummy company with links to the late President Marcos since majority of them were photocopies.It said that under the “best evidence rule,” a party which desires to present photocopies of the original document must first prove the following elements before the secondary evidence is admitted by the court:the existence or due execution of the original;the loss and destruction of the original or the reason for its non-production in court; andthe absence of bad faith on the part of the offeror to which the unavailability of the original can be attributed.The Sandiganbayan said the government failed to support the acceptability of its secondary evidence and instead proceeded with the presentation and identification of the photocopied documents without explaining why the original documents could not be produced in court.“What is only obvious to the Court is that the documents passed or were transferred from one office to another and kept by the designated custodians but it is unclear if the documents that were turned over to these offices were originals,” the ruling read.The Sandiganbayan said the government likewise failed to comply with the requirements for the authentication of private documents, which formed bulk of its documentary evidence.While the court said the circumstances “directly and positively linking” former President Marcos to the GCFI can be gleaned from the private documents such as letters, reports and memorandum presented by the government, it failed to establish their evidentiary worth.As such, the Sandiganbayan said “there is no competent evdence showing the GCFI was a dummy corporation of former President Marcos.”The court said the four other corporations mentioned by the PCGG also depend “on the same incompetent evidence,” although prosecutors did not present as much documents about them compared with GCFI.The late President Marcos and his wife were also named defendants in the case although they were declared in default due to their failure to file their answer within 60 days from Nov. 10, 1988, when the alias summonses were served upon them.Another defendant, Ricardo Quintos, was subsequently declared in default while the other one, Nelia Gonzales, filed her answer but did not participate in subsequent proceedings.ALSO READ: THE HIDDEN TRUTH, MARCOS CASES ACQUITTED(excerpt from source) VVP, GMA NewsCommentscomments",

Free Malaysia Today recently reported that government hospitals in Malaysia have been allegedly reusing medical devices and pieces of equipment.According to the source, an insider told them the following information:“This includes equipment used in neurosurgery to cardiology, and even in general surgeries. In cases where equipment used to be thrown away, doctors are now being asked to recycle the equipment.”The budget allocated for these types of hospitals were reportedly scarce in the first place. In addition, the budget cuts were too large to sustain. The insider continued:“There was a cut of RM1 billion last year. So hospitals are going to get stuck with this as there has been a heavy increase in patients coming in from the private sector.”The patients also reportedly bought their own medication and conduct their tests externally to “save budget.” The insider shared:“All this has not been highlighted. Many patients are being told to do their tests outside the hospital, pay for it themselves and bring back their results to the hospital later. They claim that these are ‘unnecessary’ tests, but the truth is they just do not have the money.”In addition, the government hospitals do not have the ability to repair pieces of machinery that have broken down or needed to be fixed. The insider said:“There are many hospitals that are encountering this. There are some machines that have not be repaired for up to a year. All these machines are vital for operations, like cardiac monitors which have broken down and there was no money to repair it. They probably have to wait until the next budget allocation before they can repair it.”Despite all the alleged incidents, the source said that there is a so-called “gag order” on the budget, where all of the medical staff in these hospitals are supposedly barred to talk about.Meanwhile, The Malay Mail Online reported that the practice has always been done in Malaysia before. According to Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Ministry of Health’s Director-General:“However, there are some single-use medical devices that are used more than once, whereby it has to undergo reprocessing via thorough cleansing and sterilisation processes before it can be reused for few times.” “In fact, this reprocessing practice is a norm even in private health facilities in Malaysia and in developed countries such as United States, European Nations and OECD countries. US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for instance, had listed 229 single-use devices known to be reprocessed or considered for reprocessing.”Here are the netizens’ comments about it:What do you think about this, readers? What can you say about Malaysian hospitals allegedly reusing its single-use medical devices in government hospitals? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!",

The business already has clients in India, but a local presence will allow it to better service customers in the country, it added.Beyond offering standard cloud products — like large scale computing, storage and big data capabilities — India-based customers will get access to elastic computing, database, storage and content delivery, networking, analytics and big data, containers, middleware, and security.The new center will give Alibaba Cloud 33 availability zones, which covers regions including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, Europe, and the U.S..“As we build out the Alibaba Cloud network globally, India is another important piece that is now firmly in place. This continues our commitment to India, helping it to develop trade opportunities with other markets in the region and beyond,” Simon Hu, Senior Vice President of Alibaba Group and President of Alibaba Cloud, said in a statement.Alibaba previously revealed plans for the India data center — and another in Indonesia — in June.Earlier this year, we wrote that Alibaba is aiming to compete with the likes of AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in the long run. For now, it is seeing most of its traction in China, but revenue is increasing at the rate of nearly double for every quarter this year.Alibaba Cloud hit net sales of RMB 3 billion ($447 million) in the most recent quarter, up from RMB 2.4 billion in the previous three-month period when it hit one million customers for the first time. Overall, the cloud computing business recorded a RMB 697 million loss, or negative $105 million, which it put down to investment in R&D having nearly reached breakeven in the previous quarter.India is also a key focus for Alibaba generally. The company has invested heavily in payment and e-commerce firm Paytm — helping it push into digital banking services, as Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial has done in China — so it makes sense that Alibaba Cloud is also putting focus there.In evidence of its global focus, Alibaba Cloud made its first investment outside of China last month when it led a $27 million round for open source startup MariaDB.",

Little did she know that heartache and betrayal awaited her.She eventually found out that her fiance was having an affair. What hurts more is that the other woman was her best friend of 12 years! Her fiance didn’t want to reconcile with her because he was happy with the other woman. He chose his mistress over the life he would have had with the female OFW and their daughter.The OFW also found out that when her fiance and his mistress went out on dates, they brought her daughter with them. The mistress was also often at their house. Her daughter didn’t think much of it because the mistress was her godmother, after all. The OFW was blindsided by the secret affair because her best friend was also engaged a few months before she found out about the betrayal.",

Rey Umali on Monday (February 27) said that the crime of plunder doesn’t deserve inclusion under the bill restoring death penalty in the Philippines since it “doesn’t kill directly.”“In fact kinuwestiyon nga, tatanggalin na sana namin yung plunder, kasi merong ano no, ang isip kasi nung iba, including myself, pag may buhay na kinuha yun yong…for us parang tit for tat yan ano,” Umali told House reporters.Hours later, the House leadership did agree to remove plunder from the list of four crimes deemed punishable with death penalty. The proposed revision to the bill was raised in a majority caucus.“Pag may buhay dapat may buhay din ang ipalit. Eh yung plunder indirect siguro, sasabihin natin marami naghirap, marami namatay because of that marami ding causes kung bakit naghirap o namatay baka naman kapabayaan o katamaran and so on and so forth,”Umali said.Plunder is the stealing of public funds worth at least P50 million. It’s a crime usually slapped against high-ranking politikos, like lawmakers.The act of ditching plunder under the death penalty bill has been frowned upon by observers since it appears like the solons are trying to save their own skin.It should be noted that treason and rape were also removed from the bill, leaving only drug-related crimes under its coverage.

    "body": "Senator De Lima argues a point at the Senate hearing on Extra Judicial Killing (EJK). Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA - Malacañang on Monday denied accusations of an international human rights group that the drug cases against Senator Leila de Lima are politically motivated, insisting that these are “criminal in nature.”Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the group Human Rights Watch (HRW) disregards the rights of the Philippines as a nation that must be protected against illegal drugs by calling on \"foreign governments to step up to denounce the Duterte administration\" for alleged human rights violations.“It banally disregards the right of a nation to protect its citizens against the menace of a global drug industry, and terrorist-connected drug trade; and that it has done so with assumption of regularity,” Abella said in a statement.The HRW on Sunday said the Duterte administration is abusing the judicial system to punish critics of its drug war, such as the drug cases filed against De Lima, who once initiated a Senate inquiry into the President's bloody campaign against illegal drugs.\"The prosecution of Senator Leila de Lima is an act of political vindictiveness that debases the rule of law in the Philippines,” said Phelim Kine, HRW deputy Asia director.The group also noted that attacks against De Lima intensified after a witness, self-professed hitman Edgar Matobato, accused the President of ordering assassinations when he was still Davao mayor.The Department of Justice last Friday filed three drug trafficking cases against De Lima for which bail may be denied.“De Lima's case is not politically motivated. It is, simply put, 'criminal in nature.' The human rights organization might bear that in mind before it attempts to obligate the Duterte administration,” Abella said.Abella added that the HRW broadly paints the \"killings of thousands of alleged drug uses and drug dealers after Duterte took office on June 30\" - without identifying what deaths belonged to police operations, deaths not related to drugs and extrajudicial killings.“Human Rights Watch blithely ignores the approximately 1,000,000 users and dealers who turned themselves in, the discovery of industrial size illegal drug factories, and the unimaginable extent that 'narco-politics' has gripped local politics, law-enforcement and to some extent the legislative and judicial departments,” Abella said.If found guilty, De Lima faces between 12 years to life in prison. Under the law, legislators only enjoy privilege from arrest for crimes punishable by less than 6 years imprisonment.",

Chief dela Rosa recently visited Mandaluyong Police Station to personally talk with the rookie cops who were involved in police brutality caught on camera.In a video posted by News5 , Chief dela Rosa was seen disappointed and irritated by the improper salute of the police desk officer upon entering the station. The officer received several sermons from the cranky PNP chief.“Ayusin mo yan,” Chief dela Rosa told the desk officer while he was correcting the position of his hand.He further inspected the officer if his feet are standing 45 degrees. Chief dela Rosa then headed inside the station along with his entourage. Netizens also praised the chief for disciplining him.The viral cops he was going to confront were Police Officers Tandog and Enriquez . However, he was left disappointed as the two cops were not there. They were the cops who were allegedly caught in a video beating a civilian inside inside San Jose Barangay Hall in Mandaluyong City.The video was uploaded on Wednesday and instantly received multiple criticism from social media users. PO1 Tandog and Enriquez quickly surrendered to the authorities after their video went viral.Earlier this week, Chief dela Rosa attended the recognition rites of police trainees of Police Regional Offices 6 and 18 in Bago City, Negros Occidental . During his speech, he challenged the 821 trainees.“I want to make sure that after taking your oath as police officers of the Philippine National Police, it doesn’t mean that you’re PO1 only of Bacolod or Iloilo City Police Offices, or Regions 6 or 18, but you are PO1 of the PNP, meaning you can be assigned anywhere in the Philippine archipelago,” Chief dela Rosa said.“It should be your mindset and [you should be] willing to offer [your] life in the service of the country. Ang pinaka ayaw ko sa pulis ay yong duwag,” he added.He stressed that as police officers, they should serve the people and enforce the law. He also added that they don’t become a cop to get rich or get involved into illegal organizations.",

    "body": "How about a 40-year minimum prison term for hardened criminals instead of death by hanging?A pro-life representative who is against the death penalty has proposed longer life sentences for heinous crime convicts as an alternative to the plan of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to reinstate capital punishment.Buhay Rep. Lito Atienza has vowed to push for new legislation that would punish heinous crimes with a harsher form of lifelong incarceration, instead of death by hanging.Atienza, who earlier backed President-elect Rodrigo Duterte’s aggressive stance against crime but cautioned against the “reckless” revival of the death penalty said that “Our alternative is tantamount to locking up a convict and throwing away the key,”.Under his proposal, those found guilty of grave crimes would receive a sentence called “qualified reclusion perpetua,” which means the convicts will remain in prison for “an absolute minimum of 40 years,” or until they reach the age of 70, whichever comes first, before becoming eligible for parole.A former Manila City Mayor said that “The problem with the death penalty is that it leaves no room for rectification. We cannot bring a dead convict back to life, even if another party later confesses to having committed the crime for which the [innocent man] had been wrongfully condemned,”.The death penalty had long been abolished by 140 countries, including the Philippines, describing it as “a cruel and degrading punishment that violates the sanctity of human life.”, he noted.At present, the maximum penalty in the Revised Penal Code is “reclusion perpetua,” or a simple life term, which actually means 30 to 40 years in prison, with the convict becoming eligible for conditional early release after serving half of the term, or after 15 to 20 years, Atienza said.A so-called “life termer” under existing laws is also entitled to good conduct or loyalty allowances, and a reduction of sentence for preventive detention or for time spent in jail prior to conviction, he said.“But under our proposal, all these allowances and the benefit of a reduced sentence for preventive detention would not apply to convicts sentenced to qualified reclusion perpetua,” Atienza saidSource: Inquirer.netCommentscomments",

    "body": "If you missed out on the recent cellphone plan deals that sparked long customer lineups, fear not. Industry-watchers say the time is ripe for more discounted plans as competition heats up in Canada’s wireless market.“I don’t think it’ll take very long to see these deals again,” said Rose Behar, senior reporter for the tech site MobileSyrup in Toronto.“Canadians are just desperate for more affordable cellphone plans.”Upstart competitor Freedom Mobile sparked the recent price war back in October, offering customers in Ontario, B.C. and Alberta a phone plan with 10 gigabytes of data for only $50 a month.Rogers made the next move on Dec. 14, offering customers in the same provinces 10 GB of data for $60 a month, plus unlimited calling.Telus and Bell quickly jumped on the bandwagon and offered the same $60 deal. Freedom then upped the ante, offering a 10 GB deal with unlimited calling for just $50 a month.Once the cellphone plan wars began, customers rushed to their local dealers to sign up for a cut-rate deal. (CBC)Many customers rushed to sign up, sparking long customer service wait times, and not everyone got in before yesterday’s deadline for most deals.Joseph Filiplic of Edmonton says he called Rogers twice and spent about five hours on hold in total before throwing in the towel.“Listened to the same three or four songs over and over again, and then I finally gave up,” he said. “I just had enough.”He was hoping to cut down his wireless phone bill. He pays about $160 a month for two lines for himself and his wife, which includes 7 GB of shared data.“It seems as though wireless is getting more and more expensive, so we wanted the deal,” he said. “It would have been nice.”Hey there @TELUS. Any way I can change to the 10GB for $60 plan without waiting 3 hours on the phone or on the chat? — @TypicalRishSitting on chat with @Bell_Support for over 40 mins now waiting for someone to hop on so I can get the $60/ 10GB deal. My contract is up soon so hoping for good service… — @tameraMobileSyrup’s Behar believes customers who missed out will get another chance, as long as Freedom Mobile continues to shake up the marketplace by offering cut-rate plans that lure customers from the big three players.“There was clearly a need to address the Freedom issue and I think that’s what we’ve seen from Rogers, Bell and Telus, and we may continue to see it as long as Freedom continues to remain a strong competitor,” she said.“It’s certainly a good sign for the future.”Katy Anderson of consumer advocacy group OpenMedia agrees. She believes similar deals could follow, as long as Canadians put pressure on their providers — especially those customers who tried but failed to lower their bill this time around.“I hope that we’ll see kind of like a backlash of outrage as people complain about not getting it, and I hope that the companies take notice,” she said.“It’s a wake-up call to Canadians that these companies can offer those prices if they’re pushed to.”The high price of dataAnderson says it’s a good time to pressure providers because our demand for wireless data is climbing — and so are the prices.A federal government-commissioned report published last week found Canadians pay some of the highest prices in the industrialized world for phone plans with data.The report also showed average family plan prices offering 10 GB of data have jumped by 14 per cent compared to last year.And a recent CRTC report said Canadians’ wireless data usage jumped nearly 25 per cent from 2015 to 2016.“Data usage is skyrocketing for all age brackets,” Anderson said. “Your grandma has a cellphone now with data and she’s on Facebook.“So I think it’s really important that we see the higher data package prices go down.”CBC News asked all four telecoms involved in the price war if there will be more deals to come.Freedom said customers can still get deals such as $50 a month for 10 GB of data, but minus unlimited calling.Telus said it offered its $60 10 GB deal in response to “a competitor’s offer” and didn’t address future plans.Both Bell and Rogers said they generally offer holiday promotions and that they’ll continue to offer competitive deals.Rogers customer Joseph​ Filiplic doesn’t want to wait for the next big offer. Instead, as Open Media suggests, he plans to call the company when he has more time over the holidays and ask for the $60 10 GB deal he missed out on.“I’m going to give it a shot,” the teacher said. “We know they can do it, so why don’t they offer it all the time?”CBC News asked Rogers, Bell and Telus why they don’t offer the $60 deal on a permanent basis. None responded.",

With over 1,300 stores nationwide, the brand brings quality roasted chicken to every Filipino’s dining table, becoming the trusted take-home “ulam” that gathers families together for an enjoyable meal time.More than just being a food brand, the company, for the past couple of years, has also shown its love and support for Filipinos, empowering them in more ways than one through its advocacies and corporate social responsibility projects.In 2014, the brand joined DZMM’s Bangka Project, donating fiberglass boats to sustain the livelihood of fishermen in Samar and Leyte who were affected by Typhoon Yolanda. It also conducted poultry training sessions among farmers in Patikul, Sulu and extended support to various indigenous people’s communities.For over a year now, the brand has also been showing support for the country’s most-cherished sport, basketball. Charged with the desire to encourage Filipinos to achieve their dreams and passion, the brand has sponsored the country’s national men’s basketball team, Gilas Pilipinas. The team is supported by the brand in their journey to success and quest for basketball supremacy in Asia.“Our success would not be possible without the support of the Filipino nation. The things that we do for our fellow Filipinos—from serving quality products to supporting various causes—are only fitting,” said Ronald Mascariñas, Bounty Agro Ventures, Inc. president and general manager.Enjoying life’s feel good momentsEven a mini ‘me’ time this Christmas could give one simple joys.Each day is composed of special moments that make life worth living. But in a world full of distractions, people tend to fast forward in life and forget the value of living in the moment.Getting caught up in their busy lives, people often miss big opportunities and ignore beautiful experiences that unfold in the present. To encourage people to celebrate special moments as they happen, Jack ‘n Jill Cloud 9 continues its #Cloud9Moments campaign.Through its campaign, the brand inspires people to recognize and celebrate everyday special moments as they can inspire both big and small changes in your life. These spontaneous moments, such as the most heartfelt reunions or the best quick weekend getaways, are #Cloud9Moments that are best shared and enjoyed with chocolate-coated bars.Appreciate life’s sweet experiences while indulging in a bite of the crunchy peanut and soft nougat coated in rich milk and creamy white chocolate with Classic and White.

Ibarra’s Party Venues & Catering knows it well and has helped Filipinos party over the years. The company has now unveiled Casa Ibarra, its grandest and largest events venue touting that modern Filipino aesthetic.Located at the MOA Complex in Pasay City, Casa Ibarra boasts of interior design that is unique through the use of different elements like wood, capiz, raffia fabric and Mindanao’s traditional T’nalak weave. These native materials can be found throughout the building’s design, accents of its Filipino identity.On the second floor is Sala de Amor, which boasts of six huge capiz chandeliers made of approximately 20,000 capiz shells each.Like a sizable four-story Filipino house from the Spanish period, the restaurant’s architecture has a facade that has a porte-cochere, where guests can be dropped off safe from the elements. Upon entering the building, Homage to Monet, Filipino-French artist Olivia d’Aboville’s specially commissioned artwork greets visitors with its ethereal beauty. The 11 x 3.5-m. artwork consists of eight panels made of 365 meters of Philippine silk textile. The silk was handwoven in Palawan and Aklan for over three months before being custom-dyed using the Shibori technique, one of the artist’s signature textile techniques.Filipino Christmas captured in bread packagingAntipolo-based artist Noel Mahilum and his artworks in the new Pan de Manila packaging.Famous for his “Batu-Bato” series, Antipolo-based artist Noel Mahilum made colorful circular strokes, featuring stones and children portray innocence and love for celebration, for his 2017 limited edition paper bags for bread chain Pan de Manila.“The artwork reminds me of my own childhood,” Mahilum shared. “When we were young, we would visit my own father in his studio, finishing his paintings. We would imitate whatever he’s doing and he noticed that. So when Christmas time came, we got our own sets of paints and easels as gifts. My siblings and I remembered that.”Noel’s father is renowned painter Tony Mahilum, a Contemporary master. His influence would spread over his children, including Noel, who would all become painters and artists. They all took up Painting at the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts.Growing up, Noel would later develop his own style. From Manila, his father would move the family to Antipolo City in 1984, which was sudden yet proved to be beneficial to the creative process of his children.“We did not expect the surprising change of scenery and environment when we moved here,” Noel confessed, speaking in his art studio in Antipolo, where he and his brothers live. “It was quiet and provincial, very different from the vibe and movement of Metro Manila. We had to adjust with the lifestyle.”Nevertheless, Antipolo and Rizal Province’s rich heritage would provide that milieu for the younger Mahilum.“I remember when during fiestas and Christmas, the higantes of Angono would parade right in front of our house,” he said. “Antipolo is about the mix of traditional and modern during Christmas. Because we are located on high ground, the cool, clean air adds to that holiday feel.”Christmas also reminds Mahilum’s artwork of gift-giving and decking the house with yuletide decor. “The colors in the (featured) painting showcase the tradition of gift-giving and dressing the house with ornaments,” he added. “I remember when we were young, and my father would give us aguinaldo money. We would get to buy the toy we want. I ended up buying a set of color toy square blocks. Little did I know I was already preparing myself for an art career that early.”Noel’s painting featured those scenes of Paskong Pinoy. “The images included in the artwork are the lanterns/ parols and the gifts in boxes,” he explained. “I drew my inspiration from the beaming smiles and excited faces of children during Christmas season, when they prepare by decorating their houses with Christmas trees and parols, wrapping and opening gifts and eating together as a family.”Chilean wine and Filipino food pairingChef Sharwin Tee“A Filipino dish isn’t the one that pops up into our mind when we think about wine and food pairing because they are not classically served with wine, but with Casillero del Diablo’s wide array of wines, this isn’t the case. The brand, with its wide selection of wine varietals, gives you an opportunity to experiment and know which wine will really suit and should be paired with the taste of a Filipino food,” shared Chef Sharwin Tee, the Chilean wine brand’s new ambassador.Highly acclaimed after gaining his culinary fame for being the first-ever winner of Lifestyle Network’s reality cooking show “Clash of the Toque-en Ones” and a host of his own show, “Curiosity got Chef,” Cher Sharwin likes to experiment with recipes of hearty Filipino dishes that are deliciously familiar and easy to pair with any side dishes whether paired with a hot cup of coffee or a glass of wine.“We all know that Filipino dishes have already a very distinct and strong flavor – but I’ve decided to spice it up with Casillero del Diablo, available in Merlot, Chardonnay, Shiraz Tinto, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Chile’s famous Carmenere and the best seller Cabernet Sauvignon,” said the chef.Get the party startedAmerican-style party dishesBecause everyone’s been good all year round, TGI Fridays is doubling down on the good stuff to spread holiday cheer as it introduces new bundles that put together big flavors of two American-style dishes in one platter.Perfect for the season of sharing is the Ribs & Parmigiana bundle, a melding of rustic and delicate slow cooked ribs with apple barbecue sauce and almond crusted chicken parmigiana. For those who want something lighter, the Grilled Chicken & Almond Fish includes barbecue chicken fresh from the grill and the flaky texture of fresh white fish crusted with almond panko for an outer crunch. Both bundles come with garlic rice and can be enjoyed with new drinks Watermelon Ale and Tropical Fizz.",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines – An arrest warrant is set to be served against Senator Antonio Trillanes IV after a Makati court found probable cause in the libel case filed by dismissed Mayor Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay Jr against the senator.“There is an order of probable cause. If there is an order of probable case, kasunod na po ‘yung warrant of arrest (the warrant of arrest follows),” Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 142 lawyer Maricel Cairo told Rappler via phone interview on Monday, February 1.Binay filed the libel complaint before the Office of the Makati City Prosecutor on April 13, 2015, the same day Trillanes said two justices of the appellate court’s 6th division received a total of P50 million to issue a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction stopping the Ombudsman’s second preventive suspension against the Makati mayor.In his libel complaint, Binay cited public statements made by Trillanes and quotes attributed to him in a report published in the April 8 issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.Trillanes was quoted as saying that the Binays were “part of a syndicate” that has committed various anomalies.“Pinag-aaralan na ng abogado ko kung ano ang mga nararapat na hakbang,” said Trillanes in a text message. “Pero kung ang layunin ng pamilya Binay sa kasong ito ay para tigilan ko sila sa aking pag-uusig, nagkakamali sila. Hindi ko hahayaan ang mga magnanakaw na mamuno ng ating bansa.”(My lawyer is studying what steps I should take next. But if the goal of the Binay family in this case is to stop me from going after them, they are wrong. I will not let thieves rule this country.)Trillanes, a staunch critic of the Binays, is part of the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee that investigated the corruption allegations against Vice President Jejomar Binay, his son Junjun, and his alleged dummies.The Ombudsman had ordered the younger Binay’s dismissal over his alleged involvement in the overpricing of the Makati city hall parking building.VP Binay has been topping voters’ preference surveys, while Trillanes continues to lag behind in the polls.Trillanes will face court decisionTrillanes’ legal counsel Reynaldo Robles said the senator will “readily face” the court’s ruling.“We have not received our official copy of the investigating prosecutor’s Resolution; but if it is true that she recommended the filing of an Information for libel in court, Sen Trillanes will readily face the charges against him in court,” said Robles in a statement.The lawyer said that Trillanes is currently abroad to attend an international forum, but “he will voluntarily submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, if so required.”“Needless to state, this is without prejudice to the senator’s right to file a motion for reconsideration or even appeal said resolution to the Department of Justice, if warranted by the circumstances,” said Robles.He is also confident that any attempt to intimidate Trillanes will not succeed.“In 2003, Sen Trillanes was jailed for exposing anomalies in the government. I believe he is ready to face any consequence, including facing malicious cases and possible imprisonment, just to let the people know the truth regarding the massive corruption in Makati. This is especially true since Sen Trillanes exposés about corruption are well within the scope of his mandate and his immunity as Senator of the Republic,” said Robles.Ruling ‘vindicates’ JunjunBinay’s lawyer Claro Certeza also has not received an official copy of the court decision, but he welcomed the news.“It vindicates what our client is saying all along that all his [Trillanes] charges and accusations are untrue and politically-motivated,” Certeza told Rappler via phone interview.He added that Trillanes, as well as the other witnesses who testified against VP Binay during the Senate probe, resorted to “trial by publicity.”With the Makati RTC’s ruling, however, Certeza said it proves that the allegations thrown at the Binays “have no basis at all.”",

He briefly appeared with her in “Home Sweetie Home” before.According to Xander, “Hindi kami naging super close. Pero sana ngayon maging super close pa po kami ‘pag nagkaroon po ng chance.”Now, months after the revelation, YouTube channel “ShowbiZzz” has shared a video report that alleged Xander Ford might have a new love team partner – and she’s not Miles.They compiled several pictures of the social media sensation with a young woman. At first, every picture seemed to indicate they were friends but upon further seconds into the video, it might be safe to say that the two are close to each other.In fact, the young woman seemed to be so comfortable with him in their poses. Could it be? Could she be the new love team partner that Xander Ford so wanted to have?We do not know. What the source revealed was her identity or moniker. According to them, she’s “Snake Princess.” Snake Princess, just like Xander, has her own following on social media.She has her Facebook page simply named “Snake Princess,” where it has a total following of around 318,087 netizens as of this writing.In an additional report from Sun Star, she is cited for her trademark “hugot” punchlines and iconic flipping of her bangs. Her real name is Mark Anthony Abucejo but she goes by “Snake Princess.” Her online persona was touted as “feminine.” The source said:“When she utters her lines in thick Bisaya–flavored English, she scores a point against the Filipino’s English snobbery. She advises the lovelorn, specially females, to love themselves first and never allow their partners to treat them like doormats.”Meanwhile, there are no official statements from Xander Ford himself if he is really involved with Snake Princess.Watch the video below:Here are the comments from the netizens:What do you think about this, readers?

    "body": "Dwight Ball never thought about bowing out of the race for premier, even as he was dogged by an alleged drug dealer and provided key information in a murder investigation.His daughter, Jade Ball, encouraged him not to, even as she struggled with her own drug addiction.“That’s the very last thing she ever wanted me to do is quit because of the issues she’s dealing with,” Ball said, his voice cracking as his eyes grew red.‘I’m a parent, who just happens to be the premier.’ — Dwight Ball“Even this morning, [she sent] text messages saying, ‘Dad, you’re doing a good job. I’m proud of you, continue to do what you’re doing.'”In an interview with CBC News on Wednesday, Ball opened up about his connection to the Brandon Phillips murder trial, and the effect it has had on his life.Phillips, 29, was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Larry Wellman, 63, earlier this month. He was killed while trying to stop Phillips from robbing the Captain’s Quarters Hotel in St. John’s, on Oct. 3, 2015.Phillips was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Jade at the time. The two were under police surveillance in the days after the killing.Details of Dwight Ball’s connection to the case were outlined in hundreds of pages of police documents obtained by CBC News.Ball went to the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary five days after the shooting with information that was critical to the case.Ball suspected Phillips wore his, Ball’s, black North Face jacket when he committed the crime.His statement provided police with enough evidence to get a search warrant for Phillips’s family home on Quidi Vidi Road, where the murder weapon was later found.“When I saw the [photo] that various media outlets had posted [of the suspect], I started putting a bunch of things together,” Ball said.Brandon Phillips and Jade Ball, pictured here in this Facebook photo dated 2013, had been in a relationship for several years prior to Phillips’s arrest. (Facebook)“There were a number of things that were happening to me personally, and knowing the location, knowing the issues around substance abuse, and seeing this black jacket,” all led him to go to police, he said.“I just felt it was my duty as a resident of the province,” Ball said.“I did it for personal reasons. I did it because a tragic event occurred with Mr. Wellman and his family.”No special treatmentBall stressed neither he nor his daughter received special treatment from the RNC, and that she is “really the innocent person in all [of] this.”At one point during the six-week trial, there was a possibility that he would be called as a defence witness.But Phillips’s lawyers decided to call no evidence.“I can guarantee the people of this province, there were no guarantees, there was no special treatment for me or my daughter or my family in all of this,” Ball said.Jarrett Cody, seen here at Supreme Court on Dec. 1, is accused of possessing oxycodone and hydromorphone. The charges were laid in 2015. (Fred Hutton/CBC)He said he has always been “transparent” and “straight forward.”The previously secret documents — ITOs, or information to obtain a search warrant — spell out details of turmoil in Ball’s life in the months leading up to the death of Wellman.Ball was being harassed online by an alleged drug dealer, and had the tires on his vehicle slashed.Tens of thousands of dollars were charged to his credit card, including a car worth upwards of $12,000.Police documents indicate the vehicle was bought by Phillips and Jarrett Cody.Cody was a tenant in a home co-owned by Jade and Dwight Ball. He’s heading to trial in the new year on charges of possessing oxycodone and hydromorphone.Dwight Ball, seen here after winning the Nov. 30, 2015 election, says his personal troubles at the time didn’t cloud his political judgement. (Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)When asked by police, Cody said he was owed money and had been paid off with prepaid credit cards, which were purchased using Ball’s credit card.As for not going to police sooner with the charges to his credit card and harassment, Ball said he did what he thought was right.“I did what I had to do, and I’m sure the timing of it could have been different, looking back,” Ball said.“I know when I felt I should go, [that] was the right thing to do and that’s the reason I went forward on Oct. 8.”‘I always take the time’That fall, Ball was gearing up for the biggest political move of his life. But, despite his personal troubles, he insists he never doubted his political judgment.“It never clouded my judgment. I always take the time,” he said.“I usually make the decisions I have to make based on the evidence that’s presented.”He said his experience with mental health and addiction has made him a good person to help others in the province.As tears filled his eyes, Ball had one final sentiment.“I’m a parent, who just happens to be the premier of the province,” he said.Watch the original report that aired on Here & Now here:",

    "body": "Gender segregation is a very serious issue in the conservative Gulf kingdom. But one Saudi man just went overboard while trying to “protect” his wife.A man in Saudi Arabia was arrested after he shot and wounded a male Jordanian obstetrician at the King Fahad hospital in Riyadh.The shooter was reportedly outraged at the fact that Dr. Muhannad Al Zabn assisted in his wife’s delivery instead of a female gynecologist.Almost an entire month after the delivery, the unidentified new father went to the hospital to meet the doctor, pretending to thank him for his help. However, when the two met in an adjoining park, the man shot Al Zabn and fled the scene.The victim was rushed to the emergency ward. Bassam Al Buraikan, a hospital spokesperson, says his condition is now stable, adding authorities are now investigating the incident.Gender segregation is a highly sensitive issue in the ultraconservative Gulf kingdom that follows the strict version of Sunni Islamic law called Wahhabism. The country even has a separate law enforcement department — known as the morality police — to make sure the sexes are separated in public.Just recently in February, women at a Riyadh Starbucks were banned from the café because a separation wall had collapsed and was being repaired.In a more serious case, a female student at King Saud University suffered a heart attack on campus in 2014. The Saudi media later alleged the girl could’ve been saved had university authorities not resisted the entry of paramedics, who were all men, for an hour.excerpt from source: carbonated.tvCommentscomments",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Monday, February 24th, 2014Only several days after beauty contestant Roxanne Acosta Cabanero filed rape charges against ABS-CBN actor-comedian Vhong Navarro, a new rape allegation has surfaced, this time from a man.The man, identified as Dennis Cornelo Nahalay came to DZBB last night and asked to go on air during a live broadcast and began his recount of the ordeal he faced three years ago, allegedly in the ‘hands’ of Navarro.Nahalay said that he is a fan of the ABS-CBN show, “It’s Showtime” and it was during one of his visits to the show that Navarro — one of the show’s hosts — asked for his phone number through one of the show’s production assistants.Nahalay said that he was flattered because he never had anyone from the same sex interested in him, let alone a famous personality like Vhong Navarro.From then on, Nahalay claimed that he started receiving text messages from Navarro, which became incessant invitations to meet up, for what Navarro referred to as an ‘appointment’.Nahalay said that after months of receiving Navarro’s messages, he started having dreams of Navarro, and it was in one of these dreams that the alleged rape took place.“Diyos ko, na violate akesh. Aminin ko, feelanga ko siya, chopopo — pero neuro, ka-shokot! Buya, dahil nagsakit ang aking uranus,” said Nahalay. (Oh my God, I felt violated. I admit, I have a crush on him, he’s good looking — but it’s mind-boggling, terrifying! Embarrassing, because my butt hurts.)Nahalay also said that he lived in Cebu City when the alleged rape happened.While shocked beyond disbelief, the DZBB radio talk show host asked Nahalay how it is possible that rape can happen in his dream and in Cebu, which is hundreds of kilometers from where Navarro lives. Nahalay said that he was inspired by the recent rape allegation made by Roxanne Cabanero against Navarro, that her story gave him the courage to come forward.Nahalay also added that Cabanero’s now-famous allegation of ‘remote rape’ on her complaint made his own ‘remote rape’ dream complaint plausible. Therefore he is going to file charges in court against Navarro, as soon as he is able to find an attorney to handle his case.When asked about this latest allegation, Vhong Navarro admitted that he did send those text messages but also said that he never intended any malice. He said that a friend told him that Nahalay was an excellent hair stylist, and when he spotted him in the studio, he did not waste time asking for his phone number, this was the reason for his appointment requests – to get a haircut.",

Tuloy-tuloy siya and delivery time is still the same (first quarter of 2020) and we are going to process that,” he added.The Department of National Defense (DND) and Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a PHP18 billion contract for two frigates including its weapon systems and munition last October 24, 2016.But he admitted that the frigate program still has a lot of challenges to hurdle before being completed.Some of the issues include how to prepare and train PN personnel to man and operate these modern ships, where to dock them, and where to source the missiles and torpedoes which are the frigates’ main armaments aside from its main guns and secondary gunnery systems.The acting PN chief said that determining where to acquire these weapons is a big challenge as torpedoes alone takes two years to manufacture.“So we have to process that so that pagdating ng frigate ay may bala [na siya],” he added.As this develops, Empedrad expressed his thanks to President Rodrigo Duterte for naming him as the acting Navy chief following the relief of Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado after DND Secretary DelfinLorenzana cited lost of trust and confidence on the integrity and leadership of the latter.This was brought about by the alleged fixation of Mercado on one company to supply the combat management system (CMS) on the country’s frigate project.The CMS is the system which handles the weapons, sensors and other equipment related to combat.The bickering on what particular CMS manufacturer to utilize has delayed the frigate project by some four months, Lorenzana earlier said.Empedrad said he will be doing his job as PN chief and that he will do his best to keep the ongoing projects of the Navy moving forward.“I’m happy to be at the helm of the Navy, and I would ask all the members of the Navy, sailors and marines to, let’s work as a team so that we can move on with what we [en]vision for the Navy which is to be a strong navy and credible navy that our maritime nation will be proud of,” the acting PN chief said.",

Tilapia has been found to be even more disastrous for your health than some of the more notorious meats like beef and pork.Wild tilapia eat a delicious diet of algae and various plants, but most of the tilapia in the store doesn’t come from the wild – they come from factory farms, where tilapia are fed an unnatural, unhealthy diet of GMO corn and soy pellets.Why can't you eat farmed-raised Tilapia?Farm-raised tilapia has been shown to cause aggravation in the body like asthma, joint inflammation, coronary disease, and a host of other problems.Farmed fish contain ten times the normal amount of carcinogenic, or cancer causing agents as fish found in the wild. It’s no different for tilapia.These kind of fish also have a higher amounts of pesticides in them, as pesticides are used to treat the fish for infections while being farmed and often remains contained in their bodies after harvesting.Tilapia has high level of Dioxin, a lethal substance that, once in your system, can take up to a decade to leave your body. Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farmed fish than in wild fish.Did you know that chicken poop is one of the primary ingredients in ranch fish feed?Do you really want to eat chicken poop on your fish? Because if you buy it from the store, you basically are.So next time you’re at the store, it might be best for you to leave the tilapia on the shelf.",

Practically every Filipino tuned into the 2015 Miss Universe’s story disclosed on June 3. Her part was depicted by rising star Liza Soberano which added to the scene’s high evaluations.Loading...Be that as it may, the glamorous lady got a great deal of feedback, both great and awful, for how she disclosed to her side of the story. One of the general population who gave her negative input, and brought on a significant debate, is her relative Alexander Wurtzbach. Alexander took to Facebook to rage about the MMK scene, saying that Pia was lying in regards to the part wherein their dad, Uwe Wurtzbach, undermined her mother and was requesting monetary help from her.A lot of her fans were quick to defend Pia from her brother’s allegations, saying that the MMK story about the former Miss Universe’s life is all true. In fact, her sister Sarah Wurtzbach allegedly defended her from their half-brother by posting a status on her own Facebook account.Loading...Although she did not directly state that the message is for Alexander, it’s pretty obvious that it is judging by the time she posted it.With all these controversies and unanswered issues, an unnamed source from the Miss Universe’s camp finally spoke out about the incident.On Monday, June 5, PEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal) received a message from a source who is very close to Pia. According to the unnamed source, every scene from the MMK episode about Pia’s life is real especially the part where her father asked for money from her when she won as 1st runner-up in Bb. Pilipinas 2013. The source also stated that Uwe even asked Pia to pay for Alexander’s tuition fee when he was still studying.The source said:Loading...“This was during the Binibini days.I’m sure not a lot of people know, but when you are 1st runner-up, wala ka ding pera from winnings ‘coz technically you don’t have a crown.So, Pia said she couldn’t help.”In addition, the source said that her sister Sarah, who was living in the United Kingdom during that time, sent Pia some money for her daily needs which proves that the beauty queen was trying to make ends meet pre-Miss Universe days.So far, it looks as though everyone is on the Miss Universe’s side regarding this issue.",

On the other hand, Javier also reached out and said that something seemed to be misaligned.

    "body": "In an age when humans in industrialized countries have good access to birth control and are seldom eaten by predators, is natural selection still directing our evolution? Probably more than you might think, a new study suggests.Natural selection is still influencing the evolution of a wide variety of human traits, from when people start having children to their body mass index, reports a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“It’s surprising to some scientists. I think it’s probably even more surprising to the general public,” acknowledges lead author Jaleal Sanjak, who just completed his PhD in evolutionary biology at the University of California Irvine. “It’s pretty neat.”Many traits vary among different members of a population of humans and animals, from body size to hair colour, and those differences are often linked to differences in genes. Natural selection occurs when some of those traits help some individuals survive and reproduce more than others. That causes their genes to become more common in the population over time, and it’s the way species evolve to adapt to changes in their environment.To see what traits were being selected for in humans, the researchers used DNA and medical data from more than 200,000 women over the age of 45 and 150,000 men over the age of 50 — that is, people who had mostly finished having babies — from a huge database of volunteers in the U.K. called the U.K. Biobank.Empty sample tubes showing their unique ‘2DID numbers’ wait to be filled at Biobank, the worlds largest blood and urine sample freezer near Manchester, northern England in a 2010 photo. The researchers relied on data from the UK Biobank. (Phil Noble/Reuters)Because there aren’t many differences in survival among humans in our modern lives, Sanjak and his colleagues looked at what traits were linked to a person having more children over their lifetime.Then the researchers checked to see which of those traits had a genetic component and could therefore undergo natural selection. They did that by looking at people with similar traits and measuring how similar those people were genetically. That is, they didn’t know exactly which genes were linked to the traits, which are influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors.Lots of traitsThe study found 13 traits in women and 10 traits in men that were linked to having more children and had a genetic component. Those included having:Their first child at a younger age.A higher body mass index.Fewer years of education.Lower fluid intelligence, which is the capacity to solve problems that require logic and reasoning.The researchers noted that some of those traits were linked — for example, people who had their first child at a younger age tended to have fewer years of education. But interestingly, among women who had their first child when they were older, those with more education had more children.While it might be surprising that people heavier relative to their height are having more children, their body mass index was measured after they already had children, and Sanjak notes that it’s not clear whether having kids itself causes a higher body mass index or whether having a higher body mass index helps increase the number of children you have.A stock image shows a family with five children. Because there aren’t many differences in survival among humans in our modern lives, researchers looked at what traits were linked to a person having more children over their lifetime in order to find signs of natural selection. ( Jaren Jai Wicklund/Shutterstock)Just because some traits are linked to more children and have a genetic component doesn’t mean they’ll cause changes in the population over time either. Men had more children if they were taller, while women had more children if they were shorter, but because height genes affect men and women the same way, those two types of selection should cancel each other out, Sanjak says.Stabilizing selectionWhile a lot of traits do look like they’ll move in one direction or the other, the researchers also noticed a lot of traits under “stabilizing” selection, where extreme traits reduce your reproductive success. For example, being a slightly taller than average man may increase your chance of having lots of children, but being seven feet tall will drastically decrease it.Sanjak says that’s exciting not just because it hasn’t been observed much in humans, but because it allows researchers to better calibrate mathematical simulations of human evolution.The world’s shortest man Chandra Bahadur Dangi poses with the tallest living man Sultan Kosen to mark the Guinness World Records Day in London Nov. 13, 2014. The new study many traits under ‘stabilizing’ selection, where extreme traits reduce your reproductive success. For example, being a slightly taller than average man may increase your chance of having lots of children, but being seven feet tall will drastically decrease it. (Luke MacGregor/Reuters)Overall, he says, the study’s take-home message is that humans are still evolving under natural selection, but the effects are not that strong.He added, “It’s probably true that sociological factors or secular trends in these traits are going to kind of swamp the effects of natural selection.”University of Manitoba evolutionary biologist Trevor Pemberton called Sanjak’s paper a “really interesting study.” Pemberton said among modern humans, traits linked to having more children are probably based on human preference rather than any actual survival or reproductive advantage. Pemberton, who studies natural selection in central African hunter gatherers, added that he’d be interested to compare the results of the new paper to what’s happening in populations that continue to follow traditional ways of life.Emmanuel Milot, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivières, says many of the findings in the new study are consistent with other, smaller regional studies.“But it’s always nice to have better, more precise data to confirm that.”Milot himself has done studies of natural selection in small populations in Quebec based on church records of marriages and births.He said the fact that Sanjak’s study deals with a very recent population shows that natural selection can occur — though perhaps more slowly and weakly — even when the birth rate is very low.“Selection never really stops,” he said. “So there’s a lot of room for more evolution in humans, that’s for sure.”",

Read on to know more!Veteran actress Jean Garcia shared that her daughter Jennica and son-in-law Alwyn Uytingco are planning to move and settle in Siquijor along with her granddaughter, Mori.While this is sad news for Jean, she said that she respects and supports their decision as a family.“Siyempre, bilang ina at lola, ayoko ring malayo sila sa akin.“Pero buhay naman nila ‘yan at sila ang magdedesisyon.“Ako naman, suporta lang ako sa mga gusto nila.“Go with the flow na lang ako sa kanila.”She shared this in an interview with PEP during the presscon of new series “Kambal, Karibal” at Le Reve Events Place, Quezon City last Tuesday.Perhaps a silver lining to the unfortunate decision was Jean’s niece and adopted daughter named Jessica, whose mother abandoned her.It was the veteran actress herself who fixed the papers for her to legally adopt the child.“May pamilya na kasi si Jennica, tapos si Kotaro malaki na rin.“Wala na akong mabe-baby sa bahay.“E, itong si Jessica noong dumating sa buhay ko, lakas makabata sa akin.“Na-miss ko ang may inaalagaan ako na baby kaya ayan, nag-ampon ako ng pamangkin ko.“She’s so cute at napakakulit.“Kapag inaayusan ako, sumasali siya. Nagme-makeup din siya!”Like a proud mother, Jean once put up a photo of Jessica on her Instagram account last October 15.In another light, Jean is back as a kontrabida in the new primetime series “Kambal, Karibal“. According to her, she has refrained from accepting antagonistic roles for a long while, so she had to adjust for her the show.“Ang tagal ko kasing hindi nagkontrabida, di ba?“Unlike before, magkakasunod siya.“E, bigla akong napahinga kaya parang nangalawang ako!”She even made a reference to her popular character Madame Claudia in the classic romance series “Pangako Sa ‘Yo“.“Kaya super-adjust ulit ako sa pagiging kontrabida.“Yung role ko rito, palengkera na mukhang pera. Walang breeding.“Kayanag-enjoy ulit ako sa pagiging kontrabida ko.“Parang bumalik lang ulit si Madame Claudia!”",

So in the offseason, I adjusted, and now that we’re under new management, they’ve been giving us confidence and I think that’s the reason why we played well,” he said.That confidence was evident for Camson, who shot 9-of-19 from the field.“Coach Chris (Gavina) always tells us that if you’re open, take it. Why not? That’s what we’re looking for. We can’t just execute and once we’re open, we won’t shoot it. So that’s what we have to do,” he said in Filipino.Kia took flak for its offseason moves, Camson believes that the way his team performed in the curtain raiser did show glimpses of its potential.“When you talk about Kia, people couldn’t help but think that we’ll always going to lose. So it’s a motivation for us. In our minds, before they beat us, they have to bleed for it,” he said. “We’re hungry for a win and we want to show to everyone that when you’re facing Kia, we’re not easy-pickings. If we lose, we’ll make sure they worked hard for it.”And Camson is confident to say that it won’t take that long before the Picanto get that elusive win.“This Kia team is different. It’s really different compared to how we were before.”",

He did acknowledge he had not been forthcoming in earlier statements about the investigation.Green was a vital political ally who acted as a de facto deputy prime minister and supported Prime Minister Theresa May, right, in Brexit negotiations. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via AP)A report by May’s cabinet secretary concluded that Green had made misleading statements regarding his knowledge about the indecent images found by police.“From the outset, I have been clear that I did not download or view pornography on my parliamentary computers,” Green said in his resignation later.“I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013,” he said.PM May asked Green to resignMay said she asked Green for his resignation after an investigation concluded he had not been open about the matter.“I have also carefully considered the report’s conclusions in relation to two statements you made on 4 and 11 November which you now accept were inaccurate and misleading,” the prime minister wrote in a letter requesting Green to step aside and saying he had fallen short of the standards expected of him.Damian Green has resigned as First Secretary of State. Full letter from the Prime Minister here: pic.twitter.com/5x7b4b78gR — @ashcowburn“It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation,” May wrote.Green was a vital political ally who acted as a de facto deputy prime minister and supported May in her difficult Brexit negotiations.He had claimed earlier he was the victim of a smear campaign. The pornography was found on his computer during a police investigation of government leaks.Sexual harassment claimsThe cabinet investigation did not yield a conclusion about sexual misconduct allegations writer Kate Maltby made against Green.Maltby said Green had “fleetingly” touched her knee during a meeting in a pub and later sent a suggestive text after a picture of her wearing a corset appeared in a newspaper.The cabinet secretary investigation said it was “not possible to reach a definitive conclusion” on whether Green’s behaviour with Maltby was appropriate, but added that her account was “plausible.”Green is among a number of British politicians who have stepped down or been forced out in recent weeks as a wave of allegations of sexual harassment has surfaced.",

However, her win doesn’t mean that she deserved the spot. The netizen also said that the next round of voting for FHM’s 100 Sexiest should only consider 20% for its audience impact. She also added that there should be other judges aside from the public to help decide on who should be the winner.",

One of the boxes made to a Filipina girl 14 years ago. The sender and the receiver of the Christmas Box did not expect that they would get married to each other.Their story began in 2000 when Tyrel Wolfe was just a young boy from Idaho filled a box for the Samaritan's Purse. Aside from the goodies and treats he put in the box he also slipped in a photo of himself with his name and address written at the back.Tyrel's box made it to the Philippines and was happily received by a young Joana Marchan and found the sender's photograph inside. Feeling grateful, Joana tried to send Tyrel a letter to thank him for the gift but it did not reach him for unknown reasons.Many years past, the sender and receiver of the Christmas box had grown up and is now living in the age of social media. Remembering the generous sender, Joana searched for Tyerl's name on Facebook. She found him. Tyrel ignored her friend request for months but eventually accepted it and they became fast friends.Chatting up online for hours their friendship grew into romance. The two decided it's time they see each other in person so Tyrel decided to visit the Philippines.They met in person. Looked each other in the eyes and they both confirmed that their love is real.Joana said she cried tears of joy when they met and that her tears just started flowing and she was overwhelmed by an 'amazing feeling' when she saw his face.In an interview, Tyrel revealed that he was nervous when he visited the Philippines to see Joana but when he finally saw her wearing a big beautiful smile he knew it was their destiny.Tyrel visits Joana twice more before asking for her hand.Watch the heartwarming interview with the couple below:",

He said the president’s cancer has so become so advanced he was defecating and pissing in his own bed. This was a month ago. If this is true, I believe President Duterte is dead.Many people who saw Duterte during the SONA and who also saw him during the Asian SUMMIT say that there is a big difference between the 2 men. Duterte during his last SONA had a hard time speaking and walked slow. And he appeared to be weak. But the Duterte in the Asian SUMMIT looks younger and he did not any of these health problems I mentioned earlier.According to reptoid aliens Dolly Barrion and I are in contact with, the Duterte you see now is an reptoid alien in disguise. These reptoids can copy any human shape and form they want.When my asset Trax told Chief PNP Bato that the current Duterte is a reptoid alien imposter, he responded, “Kaya pala may mga kakaiba sa kanya.” (You will find Trax speaking on Youtube regarding the CIA. I’m posting the link below.)According to DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade, the last time he had a meeting with Duterte, the ‘president’ couldn’t remember major issues they discussed in the past. Mayor of Salmal, David Uy apparently said the same thing regarding their recent meeting.I BELIEVE DUTERTE IS DEAD. I BELIEVE THE CURRENT DUTERTE IS AN IMPOSTOR! So I challenge the president to step forward and clear my allegations immediately!She Dragon 696",

    "body": "With the advent of the Christmas season, droves of our overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) coming back home to the Philippines are predictable events each year. It is because of our culture and tradition to spend as much as possible this special occasion with the family, relatives and friends.Despite such yearly certainty, however, our airport officials still could not cope with the heavy influx of our returning OFWs coming in large numbers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) with the onset of the Christmas season.This I personally saw and experienced the almost nightmarish human traffic inside NAIA-1 when I got back last Dec. 9 from Brussels. It was a Saturday when our flight arrived exactly on time, 11 o’clock in the morning after attending the five-day European Union (EU) Journalists Programme.It took me until 1 p.m. before I was able to get out of the NAIA-1 terminal after a gruelling long wait and queues from immigration to getting our luggage from the carousel conveyor.A stopover at the Dubai International Airport for our connecting eight-hour flight to Manila, the Etihad Boeing 777 plane – that can carry up to a maximum of 370 people – had full capacity seated passengers.And yes, most of them were OFWs coming back for Christmas.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1But the first thing our weary and homesick-OFWs get to see when they return here is a dose of bureaucratic ills starting from the maze-like queues leading to the immigration arrival booths.There are seven booths that are supposed to be manned by four immigration officers at NAIA-1. But on that typical peak hours of arrival when five to six flights come in, there were only three immigration officers at each booth. Of the seven booths, three booths are for passengers with foreign passports. Four booths are for all Philippine passport holders but two of them are dedicated for OFWs and one booth is exclusive for senior citizens, persons with disability, pregnant women/families.In fairness, however, it would take only a few minutes processing or less than five minutes for the immigration officers to process each passenger. That is, if there is no problem with his or her passport and other documents.What I find glaringly lacking is the presence of ushers to direct and control, especially unruly passengers who don’t respect queues. Tired from long haul flights and wanting not to miss their connecting flights to provinces, some of the OFWs were justifiably wanting to get ahead of others in the long lines. Thus, there were a lot of shoving and shouting at the immigration queues.After getting through the immigration area, the next long wait came at the carousel area. The operator for whatever bright idea he has, turns off-and-on the machine that prevented luggage from freely coming out of the conveyor even as passengers who already cleared the immigration trickled in to pick up their respective baggage and balikbayan boxes. He was obviously lazy to move and arrange the luggage to free spaces at the carousel.If the Philippines hopes to be the center of international trade and tourism in the region, it must encourage and promote international and domestic air traffic in the country. One of the ways to achieve this is to create a better first impression for local and foreign tourists through the continued upgrade of the four NAIA passenger terminals.That’s on the Christmas wish list, for sure, of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) which envisions itself as the leading organization in airport development and management by 2020. As the government agency tasked with the management of Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the NAIA, the MIAA must carry out its mandate of formulating and applying acceptable standards of airport accommodation service, as well as upgrading and providing safe, efficient and reliable facilities for all domestic and international air travellers.According to the Department of Transportation (DOTr), the Duterte administration has been able to institute several reforms, including the restriction on general aviation to prioritize commercial flights and reduce flight delays, and the imposition of the five-minute rule (where pilots who declare they are ready to take off must depart within the prescribed time or they would be put back at the back of the queue) to reduce flight delays and instill discipline among airlines.Rapid Exit Taxiways have also been constructed to allow an aircraft to leave the runway at higher speed and increase flight movements. The DOTr says the NAIA now has free Wi-Fi, an area for well-wishers, and cleaner toilets.Regular taxis have also been allowed to queue and pick up passengers at designated points in NAIA terminals to address shortage of taxi units servicing passengers.While these achievements make for great Christmas gifts for our OFWs, many more wishes need to be fulfilled at the NAIA, especially during this holiday season: more convenient access to cheaper public transportation, shorter queues, improved facilities, etc.And let’s not forget that yet-to-be-granted wish of the people employed by the NAIA’s service providers and concessionaires: the immediate resolution of their month-to-month contract renewal.Then, there is the case of the blind masseurs who were displaced from their original posts at the Duty Free Philippines shop due to the installation of the store’s Christmas display at the NAIA-1 terminal. Election lawyer Romulo Macalintal, who also advocates for the rights of persons with disability and senior citizens, took up the cause of the displaced blind masseurs. He urges the MIAA to bring them back to the same spot at the waiting area near the exit door of the Duty Free where they have become popular spot for tired travellers.If the DOTr and MIAA would really like to make this Christmas bright and the coming New Year a prosperous one, they could provide these airport workers with long-term engagement to encourage them to do a better job and serve better the public, especially our returning OFWs.",

    "body": "End of tax-free living in Saudi Arabia as oil revenues dry upSaudi Arabia has introduced a value-added tax (VAT) with the approval of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), indicating the end of life without VAT across the Gulf.The decision was taken on Monday and implies a five percent levy on some goods across the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which unites Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Other Gulf countries are also expected to follow and introduce the VAT system by the beginning of 2018.The move has IMF backing, which recommended the Gulf States impose revenue raising measures. The countries have already introduced taxes on tobacco and fizzy drinks.“A Royal Decree has been prepared,” the official Saudi Press Agency said.The tax on tobacco, now at 50 percent, will be increased to 100 percent, the same level as those for energy drinks and sodas.Residents of the region had enjoyed the tax-free period before the oil prices more than halved. The price of a barrel of crude oil fell from over $114 in 2014 to just over $55 currently.Last year, the world’s largest crude exporter announced some austerity measures. Saudi Arabia froze major infrastructure projects, slashed ministers’ salaries and imposed a wage freeze on civil servants. Riyadh managed to reduce the budget deficit from a record $98 billion in 2015 to $79 billion last year.The country also made unprecedented cuts to fuel and utility subsidies, as it seeks to diversify its revenues to balance the budget by 2020.

    "body": "ON strictly legal grounds, lawyers and justices will probably consider this as immaterial and irrelevant to the case of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo that has now moved to the Supreme Court for resolution.But I put it to the learned justices and the nation—that it is in every way material to consider:First—That Arroyo is the economist and leader who passed the policy reforms that paved the way for the revival and resurgence of the Philippine economy.The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) says so. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says so. The World Bank (WB) says so. And the credit-rating agencies also say as much.Second—Since Day One of his presidency, Benigno S. Aquino III has relentlessly persecuted and prosecuted Arroyo for all kinds of offenses, including plunder, electoral sabotage and corruption, and proven nothing.Third—Aquino has systematically taken (stolen) the credit for Arroyo’s legitimate achievements as President. And his cronies in the private sector and the media have conspired with him in propagating the lie.If as Harvard moral and political philosopher Michael Sandel is correct when he writes that, “Justice is about answering the question ‘what’s the right thing to do?’ then the full impact of the Arroyo presidency on national life must be weighed by the High Court in resolving her case.IMF on policy reformsWhenever President Aquino speaks of Aroyo’s decade of leadership (2001 – 2010), he has derisively called it “the lost decade.”It is a blatant lie. In truth, it was a decade of major policy reform in the Philippines, or so says the IMF, which usually knows what it is talking about.In its “Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific,” the IMF has cited the Philippines as one of three countries in the ASEAN region that have undertaken policy reforms that led to the narrowing of social inequality; the two others are Thailand and Malaysia.Significantly, the Philippine reforms commended by the fund were all launched and undertaken during the term of President Arroyo and not during the current term of President Aquino.Specifically, the IMF cited a range of measures implemented in the 2000s to alleviate poverty and inequality.To quote the report: “In 2002, the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services Program provided resources to poor rural municipalities to invest in public goods.A package of pro-poor spending programs was launched in mid-2008 to mitigate the effects of the international food and fuel crisis.” Both these periods fell under the term of Mrs. Arroyo.The IMF continued: “In addition, conditional cash transfers, also introduced in 2008 (also under Arroyo), set health and education goals for participants that aim to alleviate persistent inequality in access to education.”“With a limited budgetary footprint (0.4 percent of gross domestic product), the program had covered 75 percent of all households identified as poor by the national targetingscheme by 2013,” it said.Finally, under the Arroyo administration, “the Philippine Congress mandated that from 2008 to 2018 at least 8 percent of banks’ loan portfolios be allocated to micro and small enterprises. Micro insurance has also been picking up in recent years, making the Philippines one of the top micro insurance markets in Asia,” IMF added.Aquino and his economic managers, principally Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, have falsified the Philippine economic record during the first decade of the new century.Far from being a time of “the sick man of Asia,” it was a time of continuous quarterly growth and stabilization for the Philippine economy.A genuine credentialed economistPresident Arroyo knew her stuff because she is a genuine credentialed economist, while Aquino and Purisima are not economists.The Aquino administration, if it understood the reform challenge better, would be able to answer competently when it is asked what reforms President Aquino actually introduced.The Arroyo reforms underpin the impressive growth of the economy over the past 10 years, and will continue to help the economy well into the future.The IMF has expressed confidence in the rise of the economy this year and next year, because it will be fueled by strong domestic demand.The IMF expects the economy to grow from 5.8 percent in 2015 to 6 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2017.“The modest uptick in growth is expected to be driven by the continued strength ofdomestic demand, which will more than offset the drag from net exports,” the report said.The report said net exports “will remain subdued” but pointed out that “spillovers from China are and will continue to be smaller than in other parts of the region.”The domestic economy posted a lower-than-programmed growth in 2015 after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter of 2015 to 5 percent from 6.6 percent a quarter ago because of a drop in net exports and lower government spending.It managed to recover in the succeeding quarters due to higher government spending and the contribution of the services sector.The IMF report said: “Private investment growth is expected to remain robust, owing to improvements in public infrastructure and implementation of public-private partnership projects.”This is the picture of the economy as the administration of incoming President Rodrigo Duterte takes over from Aquino on June 30.Stealing from the victimsOne of the vilest images of World War II was the way the Nazis looted the possessions of their Jewish victims, even their gold dentures.Aquino’s theft of the credit for the revival and resurgence of the economy from Gloria Arroyo has a similar repugnance.The least that the SC and the nation must do is to rule that her tormentor should not steal from his victim, and then set the victim free.

    "body": "Next November, David St-Jacques will have a whole new perspective on the world — he will be floating 400 kilometres above Earth aboard the International Space Station.St-Jacques is a Canada’s next astronaut, a family doctor raised in Saint-Lambert, Que., who will be performing many experiments on board the floating laboratory.He’s pretty well qualified for the role. In addition to his medical degree from the Université Laval in Quebec City, St-Jacques has degrees in engineering and astrophysics. He also holds a commercial pilot’s license.We asked the father of three a few questions about what it’s like knowing he will be one of the few humans to leave Earth, and what it’s like following in the footsteps of the enormously popular Chris Hadfield.The interview has been edited for brevity.Are you excited knowing you’re Canada’s next astronaut?I’m focussed more than excited. I’ll be excited in a year. I was excited a year ago for a few minutes and then I realized the magnitude of the task ahead and the magnitude of the personal challenge … because it takes a long time to become an astronaut and you’re stepping into some big shoes. There were giants there before me, so that was all very sobering and humbling. And then I got down to work.‘It’s perfect. It’s breathing. It’s fragile. It’s our only home in the cosmos, and we are responsible for it.’ – David St-JacquesI’m about a year into training already, with about a year to go. I’m like a mountain climber halfway up Everest: Far from base camp, far from the summit, and I have to stay focussed.What are you looking forward to?This is a huge opportunity, a huge privilege to do this on behalf of all Canadians. To leave planet Earth to go live on our spaceship, humanity’s spaceship, our outpost in the cosmos, is just a great dream that — touch wood — will come true one day if all goes well.What I’m really looking forward to might sound paradoxical, it’s when I’m finally in orbit and I can turn around and look back at Earth.Spending all that time and energy and effort to leave Earth, but the first thing we want to do, of course, is look back at our home and finally get a real gut feeling for what it is … This is reality. This beautiful ball floating on the black velvet background of space. It’s perfect. It’s breathing. It’s fragile. It’s our only home in the cosmos, and we are responsible for it.What has been the hardest thing so far?It’s a juggling act. If you want to stay at your best, you’ve got to stay in balance … It’s not only the job: it’s the family, it’s the friends, it’s my parents. I have to make sure I remain in balance, I remain who I am. And that’s the only way I can be my best as an astronaut.The 2009 astronaut candidates aboard a parabolic plane that simulates weightlessness and is affectionately referred to as the ‘Vomit Comet.’ (NASA)It’s a life of constant international travel; I’m constantly jet-lagged; I’m constantly under examination; I’m constantly learning new stuff.What’s it been like on your family?My family lives in Houston. That’s where the kids were born. That’s where I spend a little bit less than half my time. The rest of the time I’m in Moscow learning how to fly the Soyuz rocket; I’m in Japan learning about the Japanese segment of he space station; I’m in Europe learning about the European segment of the space station; and in Canada, learning robotics and various science experiments we’re going to be doing.My family comes to visit me. But my wife and I have a good routine. It’s a bit of a challenge, but every challenge has its opportunity, and it’s making us better people, I think.One of the big challenges in training for this mission is that my wife has her own career to pursue, but now with the added responsibility of me being absent most of the time. When I return it’s often more upsetting, it seems, to the household balance. But this is an effect some of my military colleagues told me to expect, and other astronauts.David Saint-Jacques in the Soyuz simulator during a training session in Star City, Russia. (Canadian Space Agency)There are other things. I’m looking forward to the teamwork experience. It is a great expedition … This is the ultimate trek. This is the ultimate adventure with amazing people I’m training with.And then there’s all the experiments we’ll be doing … that I can tell will have great benefits for everybody back on Earth.Is it hard to follow Chris Hadfield?His outreach legacy is enormous. What he managed to do is welcome everybody on board. He managed to make it accessible. He was one of the first to take the risk of being himself, and shedding the superhero persona. That is very inspirational to me. We all have our personalities and that’s one of the lessons I learned from Chris: It’s okay to be yourself. We all enjoy our missions and all derive personal, thoughtful, philosophical benefit from it, in different ways, and we owe it to the world. We can’t hoard that experience. You’ve got to share it.Do we take space for granted?Knowledge about the Earth comes from space. That’s how we manage our agriculture, our defence. Its how we manage emergencies; it’s how we use our map, how we navigate, how we know the weather. It’s all coming from space, but we don’t realize it. I remember once I was filling up my car at the gas station and I wanted to pay at the pump. It wouldn’t take my card. It wouldn’t work. So I had to go pay cash inside. Then I heard on the news that because of a software glitch on a satellite, the entire Interac was down for an hour.The space station is an international effort. Seen here, from left to right is Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov, Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. Behind them are NASA astronauts Tom Marshburn, Chris Cassidy and cosmonaut Roman Romanenko. (NASA)We’re a victim of our success, and the space station is part of that. The space station is unbelievable. It’s like science fiction. It’s the most complex thing that humans have ever built. That in and of itself is a miracle. But it’s a miracle of collaboration. It was built by 16 nations. The four biggest countries are the U.S., Russia, Japan and Germany. If you know anything about 20th century history, it’s amazing that these four countries are collaborating completely openly on this beautiful common project.There have been people living off the planet for over 15 years. We already have a colony outside Earth. We are learning a lot about ourselves, about our planet. And we’re learning about how to live in space for longer durations in this pursuit of this crazy dream of flying to Mars.Canadarm2 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) grasps as the HTV-3 Exposed Pallet is moved for installation on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV-3). There are two Canadian robotic arms on the ISS, Candarm2 and Dextre. (NASA)Canadians have so many reasons to be proud of our contributions to our space program. We are part of that club of nations that are pushing the boundaries of humanity.Metaphorically, we used to live in caves … Then someone thought, hey, let’s go see what’s outside. Then we wanted to have a look up on mountains and at the other valley on the other side and across forests. We just want to have a look at the beach. Have a look at the ocean. Have a look up in the air …. And now that’s where we are. Let’s just go have a look at space. Not only is it part of the human soul, it’s what makes us grow as a species.",

Most common of these are water traps, spring loaded bombs and glass-encased cyanide capsules.Carved Stones and MarkingsAccording to treasure hunters, you'll know the right spot where the goods are buried depending on the markers you will see as you dig. Some markers points the exact location of the treasure while are placed in the site as a diversion to confuse treasure hunters.They also believe that these marker stones sometimes indicate what particular treasure is buried at the site.Treasure LocationsYamashita treasures are said to have been divided and buried in many different locations all over the country so as to make sure the allied forces will have a difficult time finding it. As mentioned, the sites are often laden with marks and marker stones buried more than 50 ft. beneath the ground.Authenticity of the treasure huntWhile many will find the story of the treasure excavation of Gary Bautista it to be no more than a hoax, some find to this story's credence because of the number of other people's comments on his now defunct blog claiming that they too have found similar sites with the same stone markings to that of Bautista's.There are no new updates on Gary Bautista's Yamashita Treasure excavation which he said they stopped the operation on 2004 due to lack of resources. His blog where he documented his team's excavation is now redirecting to a blank website when visited.",

    "body": "In Davao City, a local radio anchor received death threats and malicious text messages after slamming the lavish pre-debut photo shoot of the President’s granddaughter, Isabelle Duterte. Moreover, said broadcaster was accused of being sympathetic to the communist rebels.The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) learned that Kathyrine “Kath” Cortez, host of the five-minute radio segment “Morning View” on Davao City-based Radyo ni Juan, got a series of text messages from the mobile number 0946-700-2090 last December 18.Following the receipt of threatening messages, Cortez filed a report with the Regional Anti-Cybercrime Division Office XI in Davao City.According to reports, she received the messages following her criticism of Isabelle’s grand pictorial at the Malacañang Palace, which also drew significant flak from netizens. Moreover, Cortez compared such lavishness to the lifestyle of the Marcos family during their regime.The first message, which came at 9:42 a.m. read: “(H)inay2 lang bata ka pa! Cge ka pa pagda0t sa gbyerno murag ka korek! Undangi na inyong pagdpig sa komunista (Take it easy, you’re still young. You always criticize the government as if you are correct! Stop siding with the communists)!”It was followed by another SMS message: “Undangi na iny0ng kabuang, oi! basin di namo maabtan 2018 klaro kaayo m0 kumunesta (Stop your foolishness. You might not live to see 2018, it’s clear you’re communists)!”The last one sent read, “[I]sang bala para nimu! meri xmas (A bullet for you! Meri Christmas)!”Apart from reporting the incident to proper authorities, Cortez also published the screenshots of said threats on her Facebook account, Inquirer report says.NUJP condemned the act, and pointed out that Cortez has been outspoken on “human rights violations, continuing harassments on Lumad communities, and the one-year extension of martial law in Mindanao.”In a text message to GMA News Online, Presidential Communications Undersecretary Joel Egco, the head of Presidential Task Force on Media Security (PTFoMS), stated that President Rodrigo Duterte does not accept violence against the media. Naturally, death threats fall under that same category.Moreover, the PTFoMS is on Cortez’s case since the threat against her was considered as ‘red-tagging’. Atty. Jay de Castro, Egco’s chief of staff, told GMA News Online: “The action that we did was to write a letter to the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] for verification of the threats made against Kath. Because this case of Kath is actually red-tagging.”On the other hand, the President defended his granddaughter’s controversial pictorial, pointing out that most visitors often take photos of themselves at the Palace.“Yung isang anak ko, and lumabas nga doon sa Daily Star na nagpa-picture. Ano ba naman ‘yan? Kadugo ko ‘yan eh. Small matter, gamitin lang ‘yung Malacañang. Wala naman ako doon,” Duterte explained previously.“But even if I was there, itong granddaughter ko magpa-picture, lahat nga ng mga bisita pumupunta diyan, nagpapa-picture eh. You know, that girl, she’s going to be 18 years old,” the President added.Isabelle is the daughter of Davao City Mayor Paolo Duterte, the President’s son. does not condone violence against journalists or persons working in media. Death threats are a serious offense and no person should ever wish to bring harm to others.What do you think of this story? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.",

    "body": "Former President Benigno Aquino III on Thursday said he was not advised against Dengvaxia from the time of its procurement until his administration rolled out its nationwide anti-dengue vaccine program.Loading...Aquino, who attended the joint hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon, Health, and Finance panels into the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy as a resource person, said no questions were raised when the now-controversial vaccine was bought during his term.“Bago nagdesisyon ang gobyerno sa Dengvaxia, habang nagdedesisyon, pagkatapos magdesisyon, at hanggang ngayon, walang nagparating sa akin ng pagtutol sa bakuna,” he said.[Translation: No one advised me against Dengvaxia during the decision-making process, after we procured, and until now.]The Aquino administration bought P3.5 billion-worth of dengue vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur in 2016. The national immunization program began a month before the presidential elections in May.The pharmaceutical giant in November 2017 revealed Dengvaxia may lead to more severe forms of dengue in those not infected by the virus before.Aquino said he was told by experts Dengvaxia went through safety and efficacy tests.“Sa aking pagkaunawa, sa lahat ng ibinalita ng eksperto, dumaan na po ito sa lahat ng proseso para malaman ang kaniyang efficacy at mas importante, ang kanyang safety,” he said.[Translation: Based on my understanding, as told by experts, it underwent the process to find its efficacy and safety.]He added the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the vaccine.“Paliwanag sa akin, U.S. FDA ang nagreregulate sa international clinical trials. Dahil dumaan sa ganitong proseso, ang alam natin, safe na ang Dengvaxia para sa tao,” he said.[Translation: It was told U.S. FDA regulate the international clinical trials. Because it went through that process, we knew it was safe.]Health reform advocate Dr. Anthony Leachon said Aquino cannot be faulted if he was given “misleading” information on Dengvaxia.“How can you blame the president if the president was fed with wrong information by WHO or Secretary Garin?” he said, referring to the World Health Organization and former Health Secretary Janette Garin.In a press briefing after the probe, Aquino said that the purchase of the vaccines is an attempt to alleviate his successor of problems in the country.“When I talk about my successor, one of the tests if I did well or not is I left him or her, with less problems than what I had. I think this is one of the efforts to achieve that. ‘Yung problema natin taun-taon sa dengue, sana hindi na pareho ‘yung problema, may asenso na ‘yung nangyari,” he said.[Translation: When I talk about my successor, one of the tests if I did well or not is I left him or her, with less problems than what I had. I think this is one of the efforts to achieve that. Our problems on dengue should be less difficult to manage.]According to Spokesperson Harry Roque, President Rodrigo Duterte believes the former administration’s procurement of the vaccine was done in good faith.The World Health Organization said the Philippines launched its dengue immunization program before WHO issued its “recommendation” or guidelines for countries to consider introducing Dengvaxia to its programs.The WHO earlier outlined its guidelines for countries considering to use Dengvaxia.“First, use of the vaccine should only be considered in areas where a high proportion of the community had already been exposed to the virus; second, the vaccine should only be provided to people 9 years of age and above; and third, people being vaccinated should receive 3 doses,” it said.The Senate is also looking into the purchase of Dengvaxia as a possible “midnight deal.” Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Chair Richard Gordon earlier said Aquino may have been involved in a conspiracy in the procurement of the dengue vaccines in 2016.Aquino confirmed he met with officials of Sanofi in December 1, 2015, when he went to Paris for the COP21.Garin earlier denied they met with Sanofi officials to negotiate the price of the vaccine.Garin said the procurement of Dengvaxia was not hastily implemented. She said all dealings with vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur were above board.The Philippines granted the marketing approval to Dengvaxia on December 2015, making it the first vaccine to be licensed for the prevention of dengue in Asia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for the prevention of disease caused by all four dengue types in individuals from nine to 45 years old living in high-risk areas.On February 11, 2016, the Philippines, under Garin, hosted the worldwide launch of Dengvaxia. A few weeks after in March, Garin issued a P3-billion disbursement voucher to the Philippine Children’s Medical Center to fund the purchase of the vaccines. On April 6, 2016, the government kicked off its P3.5-billion school-based dengue immunization program.Around 10 percent of over 830,000 students who were immunized with Dengvaxia, but did not have a prior dengue infection, now face contracting a “serious disease,” according to Sanofi Pasteur. The government also said at least 32,000 private patients were vaccinated with Dengvaxia.",

On June 29, Thursday, the Chinese foreign minister promised something to the Filipino people.Wang Yi said:“I want to tell the people of the Philippines that whenever difficulties and challenges, China will always stand by your side.”According to People’s Television, Wang Yi released the statement in a joint press conference following his meeting with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarters in Pasay City.Cayetano, meanwhile, said that he deeply appreciated China’s support and thanked them “for the kind of words and assurance that China will always be there for the Philippines in times of need.”On June 27, Tuesday, China donated ₱15 million to those affected by the casualties in Marawi City.The source said that Wang Yi indicated it was just the first in a series of emergency assistance to ensure that they keep their vow to help the Philippines in reconstructing the terrorist-razed city of Marawi and the surrounding area. Wang Yi said:“Fight against terrorism is a shared responsibility of all countries. China has participated actively in combating terrorism. The Philippines as close neighbor is facing severe challenges caused by terrorism and of course China will not hesitate in extending its helping hands to close neighbor.”The Foreign Minister also believes that the Philippines will overcome all difficulties and challenges – particularly attacks of terrorism -under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. Wang Yi said:“China and the Philippines have been always close neighbors, helping each other in times of needs and we are good friends and partners.”In the joint press conference, Cayetano also relayed President Duterte’s gratitude for the warm reception the President received when he visited China. Duterte went to Beijing on October 2016 and May 2017.Wang Yi also said that China will continue to have friendly and bilateral dialogues with the country about the maritime dispute in the South China Sea. He said:“We agreed to continue to dialogue to further enhance cooperation and settle differences by jointly upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea.”",

The Philippine military has begun to scale down their forces in Marawi after President Rodrigo Duterte declared its liberation following the killings of the militant leaders after five months of military offensive. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)BACOLOD CITY- Soldiers have started to return to their mother units in the Visayas as the fighting in Marawi City is winding down.And President Duterte has one request: treat them well.He told a crowd of 5,000 gathered at the Bacolod public plaza on Sunday night for the culmination of the MassKara Festival that returning soldiers must be welcomed or even invited to a party.“They really went to hell. Others did not make it,” he added.Members of the 82nd Reconnaissance Company returned to their camp in Sta. Rita town in Samar last Sunday after their deployment in Marawi City.Hundreds of soldiers, led by their commander, Col. Alberto Desoyo, arrived at the Daniel Z. Romualdez (DZR) Airport in Tacloban City, Leyte, around 2:30 p.m. on board C-130 from Villamor Air Base and immediately proceeded to their headquarters on board four military tracks.“It was a very emotional scene. Our soldiers were deployed to Marawi in July and their respective families and loved ones surely missed them,” Captain Cherry Junia, information officer of the 8th Infantry Division (ID) based in Catbalogan City, Samar.Some of their children didn’t recognize their fathers since most of the soldiers had beard and long hair when they arrived.Danicelle Molino, 12, said she was happy that her father, Sgt. Dennis Molino, returned home safe – an answered prayer and an early Christmas gift.“I am thankful to God for bringing my father back safe,” she said.Danicelle said she was proud of her father and the rest of the soldiers for what they had done for Marawi which had been liberated from the terror group, Maute-Islamic State (IS).Junia said the soldiers would have to undergo some stress debriefing and retraining before they resume their operations against members of the New People’s Army.While she didn’t know if the soldiers would be allowed to spend some time with their families, Junia said their return would be considered the best Christmas gift by their loved ones.In Negros Occidental, the 3rd ID was also waiting for the arrival of their soldiers belonging to the 11th, 15th and 82nd Infantry Battalions who were deployed in Zamboanga, Lanao del Norte, and Marawi City.Three soldiers from the 15th IB and three Negrenses from the elite Scout Ranger unit of the Philippine Army were killed during the gun battle in Marawi, according to military records.During his speech in Bacolod on Sunday, President Rodrigo Duterte warned the public to be prepared for possible retaliation from Maute-IS terror group following their defeat in Marawi.“Please take care that nothing of the sort will happen again, especially here in the Visayas,” he said.While he said he was not trying to scare the public, Mr. Duterte said he just wanted everyone to be prepared for any eventuality.“Terrorism is everywhere and no nation has escaped from the clutches of the evil of the ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). It’s an ideology that is dedicated to just killing human beings and destroying places.”The President, who said he is a Maranaw by blood, said he is worried “that this might become something that we will have to worry about.”“The terrorism that happened in Marawi City, it was an awful thing to just see what was evolving before our eyes,” he said, stressing the need for caution.“It would help that everybody would also watch everybody,” the President said. “Not really a profiling, I hate it; I do not do it, like I said my grandmother is a Maranaw. Sometimes we have to know things within your control or environment.”“The Super Ferry 14 was one of the most brutal terror attacks perpetuated by Al Qaeda,” he said.“It is still there, it is existing and it has pledged to the world that they just want to kill those who are not with them,” Mr. Duterte added.The President must be referring to the February 2004 bombing of Super Ferry 14 that killed more than 100 people while heading to Bacolod City. Six members of the Abu Sayyaf bandit group were tagged to be behind the bombing which was then downplayed by government.RELATED VIDEO",

One of the most famous laptop brands in the market is Acer.Can you believe that the company surprised a hardworking young man after his friend shared pictures of him using a broken laptop? According to the World of Buzz, the varsity student named Yeop used a customized laptop that enabled him to write his schoolwork papers.The source said that Yeop’s friend Herman tweeted the pictures until it eventually gained online attention. The broken laptop was taped to a cardboard box while a keyboard was attached to it in considerable distance. According to the report:“Besides, the keyboard cover has also been removed, thus exposing the internal components of the laptop. In order to type, Yeop had to plug in an external keyboard.”Acer took notice of the pictures of Yeop and rewarded him with a brand new laptop – the Acer Nitro 5. According to PC World, the laptop is actually designed for a “casual gamer.” Based on the website:“The AMD-flavored Nitro 5 is perfect for those who want to play e-Sports games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Dota 2, and don’t mind playing regular AAA titles with most graphics settings on low.” “The overall look of the laptop is pure gamer with a matte black chassis, a red hinge between the keyboard and display, and a red backlit keyboard with the WASD control keys getting a bolder outline for easier identification.” “The most intriguing feature of this laptop, however, is a new thermal solution called Acer CoolBoost. This technology will let the user adjust the rpm-speed of the laptop’s fans.”Apparently, the company gave the young man a laptop designed for gamers. We do hope he may still prioritize his studies first.What do you think of Acer’s efforts? Do you also own an Acer laptop? What can you say about Yeop’s story? Let us know your thoughts and opinions in the comments section below!",

    "body": "An Overseas Filipina Worker (OFW) is currently in hot waters over the alleged Tarlac girl sex scandal video that has gone viral online. The clips are collectively called HK scandal better known as Tarlac girl sex video.Tarlac girl scandal videos set men on fire as it contain a beautiful woman having a hot encounter with a man in Hongkong. The woman in the scandalous video claims to be a native of Tarlac province, Philippines.We've searched online and thoroughly investigated the latest viral news feed on Facebook. We examined the content of the videos that we've collected to understand the situation.Without going thru the details, one could immediately conclude that the video potentially stars an OFW coming from Tarlac because of the headline but additional information that you can read below will truly shock you.HK scandal video of this girl from Tarlac can be a disgrace to other domestic helpers in Hongkong but we hope that we are not that quick to judge this woman. We don't know her reasons for doing such scandalous videos.Anyways, there are three parts of Tarlac sex video scandal. We will describe each of the video so you can have a little understanding of the clips.The first video which runs for 5 minutes and 38 seconds shows the pinay OFW comfortably talking to an undentified white man. She made some introductions like giving out the background of her work in Hongkong, information about her employer, and her province in the Philippines. Of course, you already know it-she came from Tarlac.Everything looks friendly in the first video. The man didn't show any hardcore interest to the woman until the middle part of the video where the man requested the Filipina to undress and remove her bra. Right after the domestic helper undo her bra, the man immediately squeezed the healthy breasts of the Filipina housekeeper.The second part of the video already set a sexual tone. The girl gave in and started to lick the crotch of the guy. Things went even hotter when the girl performed an oral s3x. The second video runs for over 5 minutes too which revolves on sucking the d!ck of the man.The third video is finally the hottest scene. The Filipina let the man take her from behind. She pretty much like it as seen in the last video.Tarlac girl is pretty and appears to be descent on her actions. We don't know yet how this girl came into this scandalous issue. It's not verified if she was paid to act or not. Also, no one could tell if the guy in the video is her boyfriend or newly found friend in Hongkong.The videos are obviously legitimate. In one of the clips, you can clearly hear the girl saying that she came from Tarlac. Another Tagalog words heard in the video includes the phrase \"so mabaho ang mga Indiano\".",

He is a natural when it comes to making people laugh with his short video sketches but nobody suspected that he also had a talent in playing the piano.The piano is probably one of the most difficult musical instrument to master but Sir Jack made it look like very easy in his latest video where he can be seen playing on a keyboard and putting together an unbelievable song medley.Who would have thought that his hands are lightning fast and very, very precise in hitting piano keys, huh?We already know that he is also an athlete - paddling for Philippine Titans dragon boat team and that he and his team has brought honors to the country many times from various competitions here and abroad. So it is totally unexpected that such a man with a masculine image also have graceful hands capable of producing sweet music on the piano that can put babies to sleep filled with dreams of butterflies, sparkling fairies and singing angels.According to one of our researcher here at Pinoy News Blogger, Sir Jack's style and technique is very unique. \"His musicality is of a rare kind that even Pachelbel, Beethoven and Mozart cannot compare to\", he suddenly said while we are on lunch break at the office.His piano song medley video has been viewed over a million times since it was uploaded Sunday August 6. Dancers and pet lovers flocked to the comment section and told him to never stop making such good music.All kidding aside, Sir Jack or Johnflorence Argota is one of the coolest social media personality out there. He doesn't let his being handicapped drag him down from doing what he loves to do. He wears his flaw like an armor and he wears it with pride. Just like our researcher we mentioned above who is also handicapped - he has hearing impairment.Here's internet celebrity Sir Jack playing the piano:(filed under satire)",

    "body": "In a forum held recently at the UP Diliman in Quezon City, representatives from various government agencies, local government units and non-governmental and people's organizations came out in one voice for \"better coordination and wider participation\" to ensure the welfare and safety of children during emergencies and disasters.The groups also lauded the initiatives of Save the Children for its \"innovative integrated approach\" in ensuring \"child-centered and child-led\" DRR programs by combining disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and solid waste management - through its EnCoRe (Enhancing the Resilience of Urban Communities to Disasters & Climate Change) Program. Children’s Challenge to Government Through songs and dances, around thirty children presented their issues and concerns to the government officials present during the event.They called for “inclusion” of children’s agenda in government programs. Aina Pachoco, a student of Arsenio Santos Memorial Elementary School in Calumpit, Bulacan, led all the guests in pledging for their commitment to “walk the talk,” saying that what transpired should truly redound to the full protection of children.“Sana po, maging totoo po lahat nang napagusapan, para sa aming mga bata,” Pachoco said. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Child Participation in DRR Activities At the forum, a memorandum of agreement (MoA) was signed by Ned Olney, Country Director of Save the Children Philippine Country Office and DILG Secretary Mar Roxas.Co-signing the MOA were 11 year old Marvin Sambilay, and Monica Baltero, 15 years old, both residing in Bulacan, one of the perennially affected provinces during calamities. DILG Director for national barangay operations, Leocadio Trovela, represented Secretary Roxas during the affair. DepEd regional director Isabelita Borres and DENR Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia witnessed the ceremony.The two agencies are still finalizing their separate MoAs with the NGO, but has already committed in principle, to adopt the Australian government-funded, ENCORE project. The agreement sought to formalize the commitment of various government leaders and representatives of non-governmental and people's organizations on the need for children's participation in DRR activities as a \"shared responsibility\" by all sectors of Philippine society.Muntinlupa City mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan Provincial Administrator Eugenio Payongayong, together with several mayors of the province, were also present as their local governments are the immediate target beneficiaries of the project. Olney said, \"Our recently-signed document would save and protect the lives of many children.Before there was only a legal and nominal recognition to the role of children in disaster risk reduction with Section 14 of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction Management Act of 2010.“Today, we have the commitment of important sectors in society - especially those in government - to ensure the participation of children in assessing hazards and vulnerabilities in their communities.There are so many things that have to be done in order to create and maintain disaster-resilient communities. So much work can be spread out, even to children, with their meaningful contributions to disaster risk reduction programs.We demonstrate this in our child-centered and child-led DRR initiatives in our pilot areas for the ENCoRe Program in Bulacan and in Muntinlupa,\" Olney added.Government Officials vow Promotion of \"Child-Centered DRR\" Government officials led by Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG) Director Leocadio Trovela of the national barangay operations, Department of Education (DepEd) Regional Director Isabelita Borres and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Assistant Director Eva Ocfemia, all expressed their support to the program.The international NGO said people who underwent drills and seminars on disaster awareness are more likely to survive emergencies and natural calamities.Reaction from LGU beneficiaries of the EnCoRe Program The forum, which marks the second phase of the EnCoRe program, was previously focused on just two pilot areas: Bulacan and Muntinlupa. Both areas have been identified \"red\" in the hazard map of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC).Mayor Jaime Fresnedi and Bulacan administrator Eugenio Payongayong, took turns in lauding the project that would immediately benefit their constituents.For More info/media inquiries: PLEASE CONTACT: Edchelle Flores, Communications Assistant Enhancing the Resilience of Urban Communities to Disasters and Climate Change Project Mobile: +63 9168714981, Skype: edchelleflores, Email: Edchelle.Flores@savethechildren.org Lany dela Cruz Communications Officer | +63 09255556290 Save the Children Philippine Country Office, 2F Midland Bldg. 1040 EDSA, Magallanes Village, Makati City, Tel. +632 8532142About Save The Children:Save the Children is the world’s leading independent organization for children.

    "body": "Erwan Heussaff entertains wife Anne Curtis with striptease performanceThe recently-concluded wedding of Erwan Heussaff and Anne Curtis in New Zealand is probably the hottest and most talked about event of this year. Aside from their star-studded guest list, the wedding was actually not announced to the local media which left people guessing when and where their wedding will be. Although there were rumors about their special day, the couple never made any official announcement to keep the ceremony as private as possible. And because the media did not have any access to the wedding and the reception, fans and supporters of the celebrity couple had to rely instead on Instagram posts uploaded by the guests.One particular event in the reception went viral on social media recently. In the footage, the groom was shown entertaining the guests at his wedding when he performed a strip show for his wife, Anne. After exchanging their vows and “I do’s,” the newlyweds and their guests headed to Walter Peak Station for the wedding party.The groom blithely offered a “Magic Mike” number for the bride. He started to remove his tie and unbuttoned his polo then danced to the tune of Ginuwine’s “Pony” which was popularized by Channing Tatum in “Magic Mike”. The guests cheered for him while Anne was seated and couldn’t contain her laughter.He was given a red rose which he placed against his lips to position his self on Anne’s lap and passed the flower through a sweet and gentle kiss. Erwan hiked up her gown for him to get the wedding garter. It is quite an old tradition which symbolizes the newlyweds consummating their marriage.The high-profile celebrity couple celebrated their wedding in front of their family and closest friends in New Zealand after a year of being engaged. The two have been in a relationship for about seven years. They both became emotional during the ceremony, probably because of the thought that they were about to spend the rest of their lives together.Anne’s bridal look was simple yet sophisticated. She wore a wedding gown created by Monique Lhuillier and decided not to go for a full face makeup. Meanwhile, Erwan Heussaff looked dashing in a suit made by his trusted tailor, Mario from Paris.",

    "body": "President Benigno Aquino III’s multi-billion-peso conditional cash transfer program will be reviewed by the incoming administration despite President-elect Rodrigo Duterte’s earlier statements on his intention to continue the cash doles for the country’s poorest families.In an interview on News To Go on Tuesday, incoming Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said she would study the current administration’s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) when she assumes office, to see the extent of its effects as a poverty alleviation initiative.“Sabi ni President Duterte, gusto niyang ipagpatuloy. Gusto kong aralin kung alin ba dito ngayon ang naitulong niya, considering na ang laki talaga ng investment natin diyan,” Taguiwalo said.The 4Ps program allocation in the national budget has steadily increased over the past several years under the Aquino administration. For 2016, it was given a budget of P62.7 billion.The latest data from the DSWD shows that there are 4.4 million poor households registered under the regular CCT program.“Gusto kong aralin kung ano ang naitulong nito at ano ‘yung mga problema. Merong reports na merong mga dapat beneficiaries na dapat ‘di included pero kasama,” Taguiwalo added.The incoming secretary said the records showed it did not lessen poverty in the country, thus her plan to look into it when she takes the helm in the department.“Four P’s, as it is now, ay subject sa pag-aaral tapos ire-relate sa ibang programa,” Taguiwalo said.“Sinasabi itong poverty alleviation [program], so i-a-address mo talaga as poverty alleviation. Tingnan mo ‘yung record, hindi naman talaga nabawasan ‘yung bilang ng mga mahihirap dito sa Pilipinas. Based on statistics, hindi nababawasan,” she added.Taguiwalo said 4Ps was more of a “stop-gap measure.”“We’re providing them financial assistance to send their children to school, para sa check-up, pero ‘yung asset reforms—magkaroon ng lupa, magkaroon ng trabaho—’yun ang gusto kong tingnan in coordination with other agencies,” Taguiwalo said.“Paano ba ang CCT in relation to the Department of Labor, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Education, and Department of Health?” she added.“Again, ang gusto kong aralin natin, sino ba talaga ang nagbe-benefit? Kasi kung mahihirap naman talaga, why not, ‘di ba? I need to hold consultations with various sectors. I need to look at the evaluation being undertake now, as well as conduct my own evaluation of the program,” Taguiwalo said.Taguiwalo said she was asking outgoing Secretary Corazon Soliman for reports and data on the program, as well as on other matters, including help for those affected by La Niña.“Humingi ako ng ulat kung ano ang naibigay sa nasalanta ng tagtuyot, kasi nu’ng isang linggo, nag-rally ‘yung mga mangingisda sa Iloilo. Sabi nila, hanggang ngayon kahit isang relief pack, ‘di pa natatanggap. Anong paghahanda sa La Niña?” she said.The incoming secretary said she also wanted to know more about the personnel of the department.“Ang sabi sa akin, may 23,000 ang staff, pero 3,000 lang diyan ang regular, so gusto kong aralin ang kontraktuwalisasyon. Bakit ganoong kalaganap?” she said.Taguiwalo has served as a longtime professor at the University of the Philippines.She retired in July last year, but was extended as professor and director of the UP Center for Women’s Studies until July 31 this year.Taguiwalo said she already informed Duterte of her views on the matter.excerpt from GMA newsCommentscomments",

It will surely be a major hub for business, investment and tourism in Clark,” said Patrick Beck, the hotel general manager, in a statement.The township has the Quest Hotel and Conference Center, with 303 newly refurbished guestrooms, the famous Mequeni Restaurant, Charley’s Bar and swimming pool. Its centerpiece is the 150-hectare Mimosa Golf Course, which is a no membership-required golf course that offers players a sprawling view of the Pampanga and Zambales mountains.“The property is just in the early stages of its development plans. Nonetheless, one can already expect to experience a pleasant stay or visit as it boasts of nurturing a nature-centered township wherein visitors can enjoy a green and serene surrounding. This is evident in the newly opened Acacia Park,” said Marla Mendoza, assistant marketing manager.The property was formerly known as the Mimosa Leisure Estate. “It was a conscious decision to keep the name Mimosa in our branding. Mimosa is a well-respected and known name not only in Pampanga but even Metro Manila. More importantly, Mimosa has a rich heritage that will always be part of Clark Pampanga, and even Philippine history. We want to respect that and in a way continue a legacy,” explained Mendoza.Besides the hotel and golf course, guests can also enjoy two luxury grand villas, which have three bedrooms each, a swimming pool, kitchen and dining area, a living room and plush bathrooms.Guests eager to explore the new Mimosa can visit this Christmastime. As symbolized by its giant Christmas tree on the hotel grounds, the holiday spirit is alive at Mimosa with the Quest Holiday Collection offers that include deluxe rooms and executive suites until January 6.Most of the developments, however, are still in the pipeline. “But the major change is how the company will redevelop the former Mimosa Leisure Estate that will make it a fully functioning hub for success. There will be an office campus to provide corporations and BPOs a new hub to branch out and to offer more employment opportunities; a retail strip and lifestyle mall to provide more leisure attractions; an event pavilion and event grounds to accommodate bigger events; another hotel and more villas to provide more choice accommodations for travelers,” Mendoza shared.",

Netizen Jake Miranda claimed that a “mystery truck” with a number PXQ-351 came to Surigao to distribute safe drinking water to earthquake-sticken communities in Surigao.He claimed Vice President Leni Robredo gave the 420 cases of six liter bottled water to the distribution center.“No other labels. No fanfare and color. Swift, simple and quiet. On behalft of a grateful city, we give where credit is due, so I just have to say thank you VP Leni Robredo and to all of you who are helping Surigao in deed and in prayer. Salamat sa inyo.” Jake Miranda wrote in his post.The photo was also posted by Office of the Vice President, but now with a different caption and thanking the different foundation.Bloggers noticed that the truck that Jake Miranda Post is the same truck that Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines used.The new exposé was first posted by Thinking Pinoy on his Facebook page.The post of Jake Miranda gave a reason to the Netizens to conclude that the camp of the Vice President is claiming that donations of the Coca-Cola FEMSA.But in the original post of Coca-Cola Femsa, the foundation didn’t credited the office of the Vice President, but credited the Philippine Army and DSWD.The supporters of Vice President Leni Robredo insisted that the OVP really deserved a credit to the truck came to Surigao. But an HR Executive at Coca-Cola already clarified that no politician requested to the foundation to help the victims of Surigao.“No one requested for that. Is part of the company’s IMCR (Incident Management and Crisis Resolution) initiative. Please don’t link it to any politicians. Thank You,” Marianne Gale R. Romero Compra, HR Executive of Coca-Cola told a VP Leni Supporter who creates a theory that VP Leni seeks help to the foundation.As of now, the post of Jake Miranda, thanking the Vice President for the mystery truck came to Surigao which really owned by Coca-Cola PEMSA was deleted or he changed the privacy setting of the post.Like This Article",

Hence, he was cleared to depart on board Tiger airways flight to Singapore,” she added.According to a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Lascañas left the Philippines as he received threats that a lawsuit would be filed against him, and that people were looking for him as well.To recall, Lascañas in October 2016 denied the existence of the DDS and that he was the supposed “team leader” of the squad, as claimed by self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato.In February, however, he said that the DDS indeed exists and that they were paid by then-Davao City Mayor and now President Rodrigo R. Duterte up to P100,000 depending on their target.Lascañas recanted his earlier claims following kidney surgery.Senator Panfilo “Ping” M. Lacson, who currently serves as the Chairman of the Senate Public Order Committee, earlier said that Duterte seemed to be keeping his hands off the Senate inquiry. (source)Commentscomments",

    "body": "In England, a woman had died after developing a flesh-eating tissue infection on her wrist. According to various reports, Katie Widdowson suffered a minor injury when she agreed to be restrained during an intercourse game with her boyfriend Dean Smith.Katie went to the accident and emergency department of Good Hope Hospital one evening when she experienced intolerable pain on her left wrist. The attending physicians only diagnosed her with a sprain, prescribed painkillers, and discharged her.However, the morning after her hospital visit, the mother of one began having blisters and black patches of dead skin on her arm, which caused her to be unable to move.She was rushed to Heartlands Hospital, but suffered cardiac arrest in the ambulance. Katie was pronounced dead on arrival.According to the Birmingham coroner’s report, the young mother developed necrotizing fasciitis – an infection dubbed as flesh-eating because a bacteria destroys surrounding tissues and muscles, causing them to die or ‘necrosis’.The disease quickly spreads and often leads to life-threatening complications, particularly, sepsis, organ failure, and death.During the inquest following Katie’s death, the assistant coroner, Emma Brown, stated that the victim had abnormal vital stats, temperature, heart and pulse rates, which should’ve prompted doctors to closely monitor the patient.Despite seeing two doctors, Katie was only asked to have an X-ray and was given a simple diagnosis, the Independent reported.There were “clear failures” on the part of the doctors, the Telegraph quoted the coroner as saying.“Her early warning score was six and should have resulted in regular and ongoing observations and further investigations. These were not carried out. If Katie had remained in hospital, it is clear that her death would have been avoidable. These mistakes amounted to a gross failure to provide basic medical attention,” the coroner underscored.Based on the WebMD website, necrotizing fasciitis occurs when bacteria enters an open wound – insect bite, burn, or cut. But in some instances, the infection also happens in muscle strain or bruise.Although there might be other causes for Katie’s initial injury, her being restrained could be the most probable reason, according to the coroner.David and Katie’s family intend to pursue legal action against the hospital for its negligence.What could you say about this story?

    "body": "NOTE: I didn't proofread this article anymore. I'm too tired already.The Year was 2015Ramirez orders an attack?“For the first time in my life: I felt like an activist. I had to do something and ask the question: WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT? I was actually surprised that it became a viral hit. Let me tell you now, that was unintentional. We just posed the question out to the socialverse, hey WHERE is the President? Nothing is wrong with asking a question.”“Only fame whore, social climber would invent such claim.”“In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.”Like this, Joyce. LIKE THIS.Ramirez and PR Asia Worldwide Before we go any further, it’s worthy to note that Ramirez used #NasaanAngPangulo on her own company’s twitter accounts:Ramirez's company Publicy Asia / PRAsiaWorldwide owns @INTERXNShe even appeared to be glad that the hashtag was featured on TV Patrol!But of course, those two screenshots are just circumstantial evidence.We need more... and more is what I'll give you.Anyone other than Lopez? My mentor,DISCLAIMERS:I have several other sources aside from Lopez and these two, but I will not be using the information they gave just yet. As I've said, I don't lay all my cards at once.I will take every step to ensure that none of Ramirez’s post-Roxas clients will get entangled in this article, for the simple reason that they may not have been aware of Ramirez’s proclivities.If your name somehow gets entangled, don't blame me. Ask Joyce. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the two additional sources I have for this article claim that they used to be part of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, but they had a falling out because Ramirez is a cheapskate, i.e. they said she doesn't pay people well.First Source spills beans on #NasaanAngPangulo I shall conceal the identities of the other two sources because doing otherwise may jeopardize their livelihood. I will, however, provide some relevant – VERY RELEVANT – screenshots.Both sources, who we shall call Source 1 and Source 2, were part of Ramirez's fleet of social media influencers, i.e. they were part of the twitter campaigns Ramirez commandeered. Referring to Ramirez, Source 1 said:“Nakalimutan nya yata na madaldal sya dati. Hahahaha! Kaya tigilan niya mga paninira n'ya dahil madaldal sya! Hahaha!” Source 1 then gave me three screenshots allegedly showing Ramirez’s instant messages (IMs) dated 29 January 2015. I have redacted other IMs to protect my source’s identity, then combined Ramirez’s IM’s into one neat graphic.\"INTERXN\" is what Ramirez calls her fleet of social media influencers.Based on the screenshots, Ramirez wrote:“We have a special assignment. Can we trend 6PM later? It is special political operations.” Six p.m. of 29 January 2015? That's exactly what Lopez told me!Ramirez added:“Our assignment is to amplify that PNoy snubbed the 44 dead policemen.” Ramirez appears to be referring to the arrival of the bodies of 44 Special Action Forces (SAF) slain in the botched Mamasapano Clash. Pnoy was absent during the arrival ceremony, attending instead the opening of a car plant somewhere in South Luzon.Ramirez wrote:“Tweets about heroism, PNoy not showing up at the rites, being a coward, shame, etc.” I think it’s clear now that the supposed Twitter campaign is against Pnoy.“Big money on the line for the team as much as P250K (Php 250,000) each but per INTERXN policy each must present work delivery in prep for the elections.” Joyce may have been referring to her influencer fleet when she said “team” and the payment per influence when she said “P250K”.Interestingly, she said “in prep for the elections”. Was she intending to use a supposedly confidential black propaganda operation as marketing material from the onset?I mean, I dislike Roxas, but I kinda feel bad for him in this particular aspect of the matter.But we’re not done yet.#WishKoKayPNoy: 2nd Source, 2nd Campaign My second source, another former member of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, provided me screenshots of their group chats, where Ramirez appeared to be providing specific instructions for yet another anti-Pnoy social media black propaganda campaign.In the screenshot, Ramirez wrote:“Wag masyado hard sell kay Mar ha and pumili kayo matinong photos wag yung mukang stunt PR (sic). Act like news outlets.” Before we go any further, it’s worthy to note that Ramirez used #NasaanAngPangulo on her own company’s twitter accounts:Ramirez's company Publicy Asia / PRAsiaWorldwide owns @INTERXNShe even appeared to be glad that the hashtag was featured on TV Patrol!But of course, those two screenshots are just circumstantial evidence.My mentor, Manila Standard columnist and former editor-in-chief Jojo Robles , taught me how to treat sources. He said I should always wait for a second independent source to corroborate what my first source said. And because I am a very obedient student, I looked for not only one, but two other sources for this issue.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the two additional sources I have for this article claim that they used to be part of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, but they had a falling out because Ramirez is a cheapskate, i.e. they said she doesn't pay people well.I shall conceal the identities of the other two sources because doing otherwise may jeopardize their livelihood. I will, however, provide some relevant – VERY RELEVANT – screenshots.Both sources, who we shall call Source 1 and Source 2, were part of Ramirez's fleet of social media influencers, i.e. they were part of the twitter campaigns Ramirez commandeered. Referring to Ramirez, Source 1 said:Source 1 then gave me three screenshots allegedly showing Ramirez’s instant messages (IMs) dated 29 January 2015. I have redacted other IMs to protect my source’s identity, then combined Ramirez’s IM’s into one neat graphic.\"INTERXN\" is what Ramirez calls her fleet of social media influencers.Based on the screenshots, Ramirez wrote:Six p.m. of 29 January 2015? That's exactly what Lopez told me!Ramirez added:Ramirez appears to be referring to the arrival of the bodies of 44 Special Action Forces (SAF) slain in the botched Mamasapano Clash. Pnoy was absent during the arrival ceremony, attending instead the opening of a car plant somewhere in South Luzon.Ramirez wrote:I think it’s clear now that the supposed Twitter campaign is against Pnoy.Joyce may have been referring to her influencer fleet when she said “team” and the payment per influence when she said “P250K”.Interestingly, she said “in prep for the elections”. Was she intending to use a supposedly confidential black propaganda operation as marketing material from the onset?I mean, I dislike Roxas, but I kinda feel bad for him in this particular aspect of the matter.My second source, another former member of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, provided me screenshots of their group chats, where Ramirez appeared to be providing specific instructions for yet another anti-Pnoy social media black propaganda campaign.In the screenshot, Ramirez wrote:Ooohh, instructions to create fake news?The IM was accompanied by a sample tweet that reads:“Respeto at Hustisya para sa Fallen 44. #WishKoKayPNoy” The sample tweet included photos of Roxas taken during the SAF 44 arrival ceremonies.OOHHH, SNEAKY! Aktibista ka lang talaga, Joyce? Talaga lang?Orders from up above? Based on the evidence, Ramirez appeared to have machinated at least two Twitter campaigns against Roxas’s own principal, President Benigno Aquino III, with the second campaign launched barely a week after the first.Based on another screenshot, Joyce was acting on someone else’s orders, presumably from DILG Usec. Tom Villarin, basing on Lopez’s information.Ramirez wrote:“Eto daw #WishKoKayPNoy inject positive images na si Mar Roxas ang humarap sa burol so paki-Google photos positive spin for Mar pero wag hard sell or halata. Photos na lang ikalat no words let the people comment wag tayo.” One of her influencers replied with a photo, and Ramirez responded with:“Yes, mga ganyan. Discreet kundi aawayin tayo ng lahat.” Judging from the 08 February #WishKoKayPnoy sample tweet, this exchange of IMs happened around 08 February 2015.And yes, it appears that Mar Roxas is indeed the beneficiary of both Twitter campaigns.But Pnoy’s loyal minions in Malacañang seem to have caught wind of Ramirez’s online operations.The IM was accompanied by a sample tweet that reads:The sample tweet included photos of Roxas taken during the SAF 44 arrival ceremonies.Based on the evidence, Ramirez appeared to have machinated at least two Twitter campaigns against Roxas’s own principal, President Benigno Aquino III, with the second campaign launched barely a week after the first.Based on another screenshot, Joyce was acting on someone else’s orders, presumably from DILG Usec.

Remember to always keep neutral. Delete muna any post na may government related content cos we are being monitored daw by government kahit wala naman tayo pinost na masama for your safety thanks.” Ok, hold on one second!FIRST, it’s clear that the two twitter campaigns #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy were intended to discredit then President Aquino, so I do not understand how Ramirez could say that “they’re not doing anything bad”.SECOND, it’s also difficult to understand how Ramirez’s fleet of influencers can “keep neutral”, since the two campaigns specifically are black propaganda. Thus, I can only surmise that Ramirez meant the exercise of greater subtlety among her minions.THIRD, it’s interesting that Ramirez seems to have acknowledged the presence of a Pnoy-era online monitoring team. Was Ramirez referring to the “Malacañang Call Center” that former PCDSPO chief Ricky Carandang reportedly created? Was Ramirez referring to the the same Aquino-era Malacañang Call Center where Palace-sponsored cyber operations – including troll operations – allegedly took place?And by the way, Pinoy Ako Blog’s On 18 February 2015, or a little over a week later, Ramirez re-emerged in the group chat.Ramirez wrote:Ok, hold on one second!, it’s clear that the two twitter campaigns #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy were intended to discredit then President Aquino, so I do not understand how Ramirez could say that “they’re not doing anything bad”.it’s also difficult to understand how Ramirez’s fleet of influencers can “keep neutral”, since the two campaigns specifically are black propaganda.

Ask Roosevelt.Coincidence? Ask Roosevelt.Regardless, what’s clear here is that whatever deal Ramirez had with the Roxas camp was more than just a one-off affair and that Ramirez loves sipping her own Kool-Aid.But it gets even more interesting from here.Like a scorned loverApparently referring to Roxas, Ramirez wrote:\"Di man lang niya isipin puwede natin siya ituro for destabilization.\" In an earlier conversation and based onRamirez replied:“Told yah. It’s him.” According to the screenie, the influencer even offered to save the pictures as evidence.Ramirez also wrote:“Hard mo na masusuka tao sa kanya not branding.” Judging from his screenshot, Ramirez ordered the influencer to hard-sell Mar Roxas, which is the total opposite of her orders at the beginning, which was to subtly sell Mar Roxas and nothing more.Hard selling means blatantly and shamelessly promoting something. This tactic is generally frowned upon by the PR community because it is usually off-putting for target audience.Essentially, Ramirez seems to have instructed her influencers to hard sell Roxas, i.e. still fulfill her agreement with the Roxas camp while sabotaging it at the same time.Ramirez apparently went as far as threatening to preserve evidence about their transactions when she wrote:“Beat your own prof losers. Evidence pa ha. DILG making orders against PNoy so stupid.” Yes, at this point, it appears that Ramirez is sabotaging her own client.It's interesting that Ramirez has so much confidence on her PR skills. I mean, if she's really good, then why am I writing this article right now?But how did it come to this point? Why did these even happen?Money. Money, Money Another screenshot from 25 February 2015 provides more insight about the why behind the what:Based on the image, Ramirez wrote:“Ibabasura ko yang Mar hanggang ngayon di nagbabayad puro utos ang DILG ang kakapal.”Ramirez, presumably out of anger or sheer disappointment, called Mar a “squatter”. But another screenshot suggests that her vendetta didn’t end there:Ramirez wrote:“Villarin DILG Usec. Wala bayad as if. Sa sobrang galit ko pinadala ko kay VP Binay.” Ramirez posted an image showing her message to then Vice-president Jejomar Binay’s camp, which reads:“BayanMuna and the reaffirmist groups are one of the primary movers behind the oust Pnoy activities. They join VP Binay, Peping Cojuangco, GMA, the Napoles senators and corrupt businessmen like Bobby Ongpin in an unholy alliance to use the #saf44 as a way to oust PNoy. To the SAF, PNP, and AFP remember that these communists are the same ones responsible together with the NPA of (sic) killing thousands of your brothers in arms. Huwag magpapagamit sa mga communista!!!” I am not sure if Ramirez was telling the truth here, especially since she appears to be spiteful during the times those messages were sent. What’s clear, however, is that she may have committed a major mistake: she sent Binay a message that is against Binay.I guess that’s why my sources told me that the Binays never hired her.If I were a Binay and after seeing that, why the hell would I? VP Binay, good call!At some point, Ramirez seems to have become unhappy with her deal with Roxas’ camp, as evidenced by a screenshot of her chat with one of her then-closest influencers, provided to me by no less than that influencer himself/herself.Apparently referring to Roxas, Ramirez wrote:In an earlier conversation and based on pronoun antecedents , the influencer asked her if it’s really Mar Roxas who ordered the black propaganda campaigns:Ramirez replied:According to the screenie, the influencer even offered to save the pictures as evidence.Ramirez also wrote:Judging from his screenshot, Ramirez ordered the influencer to hard-sell Mar Roxas, which is the total opposite of her orders at the beginning, which was to subtly sell Mar Roxas and nothing more.Hard selling means blatantly and shamelessly promoting something.

However, let me raise some points that you may have missed out on.Two factions,In as far as presidentiables, Roxas headed the “Balay Faction” while Binay headed “Samar”. At the time, Roxas’ presidential hopes were in danger because VP Binay’s was consistently outperforming him in popularity surveys.Evidence suggests that Roxas’ Usec. Tom Villarin was Joyce Ramirez’s contact, i.e. the one who calls the shots in as far as the two black propaganda campaigns are concerned. Villarin, along with the pretty much the rest of Akbayan Partylist, was affiliated with the Balay Faction, i.e. it is in Villarin’s interest to make Roxas win in 2016.Given available data, it is entirely possible that Villarin and Akbayan launched the aforementioned black propaganda campaign without Roxas’ consent. On the flip side, however, Villarin is pretty much Roxas’ right-hand man in those days, so it’s quite hard to believe that Roxas knew nothing of the operations.After all, have all SM employees personally met Henry Sy?Evidence clearly suggests that that Akbayan Partylist – where Senator Risa Hontiveros belongs – is into black propaganda. Surely, Villarin would not have acted on his own because such a massive black ops requires thorough coordination and funding.But I guess they fell short on funding because Ramirez was pissed.Regardless, I think this adds new color to the recent I think that you, the reader, have come up with your own conclusions about this issue based on what you’re read in this article. However, let me raise some points that you may have missed out on.Two factions, Balay and Samar , dominated politics inside the Aquino-era Malacañang.In as far as presidentiables, Roxas headed the “Balay Faction” while Binay headed “Samar”.

One of the persons in the picture is actually not even European: it’s Tom Villarin.The brown guy is Tom Villarin.A gentle warning to current and former clients As promised in the disclaimers, I took every step to ensure that none of Ramirez’s post-Roxas clients will get entangled in this article, for the simple reason that they may not have been aware of Ramirez’s proclivities.You are politicians. You need publicity to survive. I understand that perfectly. Besides, I do not like burning bridges unnecessarily.I know all of you, and I think that all of you, despite your respective flaws, have the potential to change this country for the better. Don’t let Ramirez take that opportunity away from you.With that said, I think I now understand why oppositionists like Pinoy Ako Blog accuse me of being a paid hack, because it seems that most political content creators in the past were on the payroll of some PR operator, so they thought I’m cut from the same cloth.I’m sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing I got from any politician is free food.But of course, I do not speak for the other bloggers, like those who pulled the “Poe-Cayetano 2022” issue out of their own @$$. Who knows, would it be outlandish to suspect that they're on Ramirez's payroll too!?Anyway, let me finish this article with this piece of advice for Miss Ramirez:Joyce, you need a career shift. Mag-TESDA ka na! Note, however, that based on the data provided above, it’s best for you to find ways to ensure that Ramirez will not do to you the same thing she did to Roxas.I know all of you, and I think that all of you, despite your respective flaws, have the potential to change this country for the better. Don’t let Ramirez take that opportunity away from you.With that said, I think I now understand why oppositionists like Pinoy Ako Blog accuse me of being a paid hack, because it seems that most political content creators in the past were on the payroll of some PR operator, so they thought I’m cut from the same cloth.I’m sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing I got from any politician is free food.Anyway, let me finish this article with this piece of advice for Miss Ramirez:DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:During my first two hours speaking at the #CocoyGate #SenateHearing and possibly owing to first time jitters, the #NasaanAngPangulo scandal accidentally slipped my tongue. I was really very nervous then, and since I swore to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I virtually told every truth that was in my mind at the time.In PR terms, I think that slip of mine was a miscalculation, no matter how minor. That slip could have totally derailed the #CocoyGate issue, so I was really relieved that it didn’t. Regardless, mainstream media “tried” to report on it: “tried” because the articles that came out were essentially slanted in favor of the accused, with none of them – except GMA News (Thank you!) – asking for my side.Truth be told, I have already lost interest on the #NasaanAngPangulo issue, until one of my little birds told me a few days ago that the PR operator mentioned in my article – PR Asia Worldwide’s Joyce Ramirez – ordered her fleet of social media allies to attack me online. I think my very highly placed little birds have no motive to lie, so I think it’s reasonable to say, from my end, that Ramirez committed an egregious mistake.You see, I am not the kind of guy who lays all his cards on the table. I always leave a couple of aces up my sleeve for use if and when the need arises. Suffice it to say, let me use one of them against Ramirez today.In the February 2017  article “ #NasaanAngPangulo: Mamasapano, Mar Roxas’ Ambition, and a PR operator ”, I explained that a friend, former National Youth Commissioner and former MTRCB member Michael “Mike” Acebedo Lopez, told me a really good story.Lopez said that in 2015, then DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidential ambitions, engaged in a multi-million peso black propaganda campaign against then President Benigno “PNoy” Aquino, a campaign that aimed at pinning all the blame on the latter over the SAF44-Mamasapano Scandal, effectively shielding Roxas from Mamasapano-related bad press.According to Lopez, close Roxas aide and then DILG Usec. Tomasito “Tom” Villarin commissioned publicist (i.e. PR operator) Joyce Ramirez to launch a Mamasapano-related Twitter campaign focused specifically against PNoy, in the hopes of minimizing the bad publicity that his principal Mar Roxas, a de facto superior of the SAF 44 policemen, would receive.Lopez did not specifically name Ramirez, but other sources provided me with that information.Lopez, who has a hatred of all things yellow, said he helped Ramirez by providing a list of Twitter hashtag, one of which was the “legendary” #NasaanAngPangulo, the hashtag used for the anti-Pnoy campaign that was launched at exactly 6:00 PM Manila on 29 January 2015.Lopez said Ramirez maintains business connections with major social media players, which allows her to force any issue into the Twitter trending list and like clockwork, #NasaanAngPangulo trended worldwide shortly after its launch.As evidence, I provided an excel file that was last modified in 2015, showing Joyce Ramirez as its author. The excel file basically used the #NasaanAngPangulo campaign as case study that she used for pitching her services to other politicians.Roxas has since denied links with Ramirez and #NasaanAngPangulo. But that's expected.Meanwhile, Ramirez reacted to my revelation at the Senate with a statement, part of which reads:Referring to , Ramirez also said Unlike many people, I am immune to name calling, so I’ll let that second quotation go. Actually, I was even tempted to let the entire thing go because Ramirez, while an interesting figure, is a very small fish to fry. I think she’s a waste of cooking oil.But based on what my little birds told me, her recent actions warrant an Armageddon.According to my little birds, Ramirez recently ordered her fleet of pro-Duterte influencers to attack my page. I don’t exactly know what triggered her, especially since I never really mentioned her or anything related to her during the past couple of weeks.Well, a few minor social media players tried to attack me recently. They called the #CocoyGate Senate Hearing “a little Poe-Cayetano 2022 show”, which, I feel, shows total disrespect for Senator Grace Poe who could not have handled the hearing more fairly. ( Thank you, Grace. Are they part of Ramirez’s fleet? I don’t know, but quoting Roosevelt:Well, I’ll fart on them rainbows that smell like World Peace with a hint of cinnamon.",

    "body": "In case you didn’t know, former matinee idol Richard Gomez has a daughter with the beautiful Lucy Torres-Gomez named Juliana. And in case you haven’t noticed, Juliana is turning out to be quite a fine young lady at 17 years old.For daddy Richard, letting go of his unica hija is tantamount to a heart attack, so he could only quip, “Huwag ka munang magbo-boyfriend, kakalbuhin kita!” when asked about the teenager.This might’ve elicited laughter from the audience during the opening of his exhibit, “Surface”, at the Pinto Art Museum, but the actor turned politician couldn’t be more serious with his bold statement.Speaking to showbiz website PEP on the sidelines of the exhibit, Richard stressed, “Bawal pa! Bata pa kasi. Seventeen pa lang!”“Every once in a while, alam ko, may nanliligaw. May umiikot sa gilid,” he added.Although Juliana hasn’t introduced any one of her suitors to her parents yet, Richard knows that his daughter gets ‘kilig’ over the boys.“Sabi ng mommy niya, ‘Alam mo ba na maraming nanliligaw sa anak mo?’ Sabi ko, oh, my God! Eto na po! Eto na yun!” he exclaimed.When asked how he felt over it, Richard Gomez jested, “Nanlalamig yung batok ko!”The actor also admitted that he’s not ready to become a grandfather any time soon.Likewise, mommy Lucy noticed how her husband isn’t really ready to let go of their daughter. She said: “I think, any father kasi, hindi talaga handa. Ang palagi kong sinasabi kay Richard, it’s inevitable.”For her, she only wants Juliana to end up with the right guy, and not to be fearful when getting into relationships.“Ayoko namang lumalaki si Juliana na may takot. Kasi, it’s not a bad thing. It’s a beautiful thing—to fall in love, di ba? Na may manliligaw. It’s part of a girl’s life,” she explained.“So, at some point, she will experience that. And then, ang akin lang talaga, she ends up with the right man. I can only pray, di ba?” Lucy added.What sort of advice does Lucy give to her lovely daughter?“I always tell her, ‘Huwag kang magmadali. Sa ngayon, ang liit-liit pa ng mundo mo. Ito lang yung nakikita mo. When you go to college, you meet more people, and marami ka pang makikilala.’ No reason to just have one boyfriend,” she stated, “when you can have many, many friends!”“Yun ang line ng lahat ng magulang, di ba?!” Lucy quipped.When faced with the same question if she’s ready to become a lola, Lucy quickly said, “Ay, hindi pa! Seventeen pa lang si Juliana. Ang layo pa nun! Hindi pa pwede!”So, what’s the right age for Juliana to tie the knot?“Twenty-plus… basta, huwag siyang magmadali. Ang sinasabi ko lang talaga, ‘Juliana, I only want whoever God prepared for you. Kung sino man ang lalaking iyon, gusto kong magtagpo kayo. And then, yun yung mapapangasawa mo,'” she affectionately said.What could you say about Richard Gomez ‘s statement? Do you also have a daughter like Juliana? What sort of advice will you give to her?

(SMFI) formally turned over Php330 million worth of livelihood assistance to the families of slain policemen and soldiers in Marawi to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Thursday, October 26.The money is intended to alleviate the plight of the families and loved ones of the 165 soldiers and police officers killed in the five-month battle to retake Marawi City from the clutches of the Maute Group terrorists.Each beneficiary of the livelihood program are given Php2 million business startup, and they can select business package from Petron, Kambal Pandesal, BMEG Feeds, Distributorship, TJ Hotdog, Monterey Meat Shop and San Miguel Food Avenue franchise.Present during the handover ceremonies were SMFI president and chief operating officer Ramon S. Ang and then outgoing AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Eduardo Año.“We thank you for defending our country, Marawi is free and our country is much safer. But as we celebrate this victory, we are also mourning,” Ang added.“The San Miguel Corporation extends Php330 million to (the families of) 165 soldiers and policemen killed-in-action capital for business assistance, it is the best way we can honor them. We can never replace them nor repay them for their sacrifice, but we can honor them and help fulfill their dream of better lives for their families,” he emphasized.Fighting in Marawi City started when government troops tried to arrest Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon and his cohorts last May 23.“To the AFP, the entire nation is truly proud of you,” the SMFI president added.While no amount of money can compensate families for the loss of a loved one, Año said the generosity of SMFI will greatly ease the burden on the families.“We will make sure that we will help them as you helped them rebuild their lives. We cannot thank you enough, the whole AFP appreciates your effort,” he added.San Miguel Corporation will also conduct Financial Literacy Training and Start-up Business SeminarTurnover ceremonies took place at the Del Pilar Lounge, General Headquarters Grandstand, Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City Thursday afternoon.Source: Philippine News AgencyCommentscomments",

    "body": "When the web was originally designed, its creators aspired to include a way to transfer value. According to the HTTP standard, error code 402 was “reserved for future use” and was labeled “Payment Required.”Just as we needed a way to freely share information, we needed a way to freely exchange value. Implementing a standardized payment protocol was a natural fit. But while data can live in a world where it’s easily reproduced, value inherently exists as the result of scarcity — in other words, the antithesis of the copy-and-paste nature of the information web.It quickly became evident that overcoming this challenge was no easy feat, and the idea was shelved indefinitely. While information could be exchanged in a decentralized fashion, there was no way to transfer value online without a central operator.That all changed in 2009 with the arrival of bitcoin, a medley of cryptography and peer-to-peer technology that elegantly solved this problem. From that vantage point, payment protocols like Bitcoin and Ripple — which allow us to transfer value online with each other directly — represent the continuation of the unfinished business of the web’s original founders.Consequently, there are numerous parallels between the birth of the information web and the developments we’re seeing now.It’s easy to take the Internet as it currently exists for granted. Its evolution from an esoteric network for researchers and hobbyists to today’s all-encompassing mainstream phenomenon was a long and arduous journey. It started with a classic chicken-and-egg problem: The Internet needed developers to build utility on it to attract users, but developers first needed users for whom to build.The early Internet was bootstrapped by academia and the military. Though the network was already open, global in scope, and quite powerful, there was little consumer utility. Instead, mainstream consumers used proprietary network solutions that were in vogue at the time. The likes of AOL (owner of TechCrunch) and CompuServe provided value-added services, from news to messaging to games.The only problem was that these pre-Internet networks didn’t interoperate. If you were on GEnie, there wasn’t a straightforward way to interact with your friends on AOL in the ‘80s. That’s not so different from how our payment networks currently operate, where systems like PayPal, Alipay and M-PESA aren’t yet federated.Two key developments unfolded in 1989: Tim Berners-Lee conceived the idea of the World Wide Web, and CompuServe became one of the first major online services to provide an email gateway, allowing its users to communicate via the Internet. These events marked the beginning of the federation phase of the Internet’s evolution. In both cases, standardized protocols allowed users to share information or communicate with each other directly, no matter what service, software, or hardware they used.",

    "body": "It is widely believed that the bigger a man’s s*xual reproductive organ is, the better he is at performing in bed. Just like women and their breasts, people believe that men needed to have a large manhood in order to have good s*xual performance.This issue was directly tackled by Dr. Lulu Marquez in DZMM’s “Private Nights” segment. According to ABS-CBN News, Asian men have an average manhood size of around five inches.She said:“The average size, let’s talk about Asian men, is about 5, 5.5, or 6, or even 6.5 inches. ‘Yon pong sinasabi nating haba or length ng ari ng lalaki, ay hindi lang po ‘yon ang sinasabing size. We also talk about the width, or the circumference, or the girth, or the taba. Mayroon din pong average circumferential size which is about 5 inches din po ‘yong width.”The medical professional also gave her insights into the vagina. She shared, “Let’s talk about the vaginal canal, the opening, so mayroon pong lalim ‘yan. Ang lalim po niyan is about 4 inches or at the most 6 inches.”Dr. Marquez added that a manhood’s average size usually complements that of an average vaginal canal depth. If, however, the man’s s*xual reproductive organ exceeds that of the typical size among Asians, then the women might feel a painful sensation.She continued:“Can a penis be too big for your vagina? Ang sagot ay oo. If it’s about 7.5 or 8 inches and then ‘yong depth or lalim ng vagina is only about 5-6 inches lang, e di hindi tama. Hindi po siya magkakaroon ng good penetration.”The doctor mentioned that men can still participate in s*xual activities despite the largeness of their manhood since there are techniques to make it easy for their partners. She added:“In general, most vaginas are able to fit all shapes and sizes of the penises. Pero mayroong kondisyon, given appropriate foreplay and lubrication, puwede… Your wife needs to be properly lubricated kung ang ari mo ay malaki.”Dr. Marquez suggested that men could freely use water-based lubricants or those that come with menthol and L-Arginine. She also advised men who have large manhood to be gentle when it comes to direct penetration.She said:“You’re talking about deep penetration, you don’t need to do that, really. Not unless you’re too aggressive, too passionate, like napapanood mo sa X-rated, ginagaya mo na lang. It doesn’t have to be that way, you have to actually go slow.” “Ang sensitivity ng vaginal canal, sensitive lang po ang outer 2 inches. The inner vaginal canal, wala na pong sensitivity ‘yon… Not like the sensitivity of the clitoris.”The medical professional mentioned that women might incur wounds when they are not penetrated in such a gentle manner. Dr. Marquez continued:“Hindi naman lahat ‘yan [penis] dapat nasa loob… eight inches ka nga, hindi kaya, huwag nang pilitin. Kapag malaki ang ari at ipinilit, mapupunit [ang tissues sa vaginal canal]… Magkakaroon ng abrasion and that’s not good, does not feel good. Masakit po ‘yon. Traumatic po ‘yan para sa babae.”What do you think about this, readers? Does your partner have a large manhood? Do you have tips for those who have one?

Aileen Lizada said 53 employees nationwide have either resigned, retired, or were suspended from work following the agency’s internal audit.Four regional directors have also resigned, two have retired, one was suspended and another one is under investigation for corruption allegations, Lizada said.“We have discovered how corruption is done at LTFRB,” Lizada said in the Monday episode of ANC’s “Talkback.”She said fake decisions on franchises were issued.“We had to do internal cleansing of the LTFRB,” Lizada added.According to Lizada, only the province of Cebu did not exceed the required number of franchises.She alleged that erring regional directors brought in fixers who had contacts with vehicle operators for fake decisions on franchises despite a moratorium.“The fixer that the regional director brings, connects with the operators outside, those who are willing to pay and cough up huge amounts,” she said.Bus operators paid P300,000 to P500,000 for fake franchises, UV vehicles paid around P200,000, and taxi operators paid P60,000 according to Lizada.“Technically, they are all colorum because they were issued without any authority but we’re talking of hundreds and thousands nationwide,” she said, citing Davao City as an example of an area that exceeded franchises.Meanwhile, LTO chief Edgar Galvante said although they apprehend public utility vehicles with illegal franchises, their agency is having difficulty implementing the law.

Kabilang sa mga ito ang mga karagdagang amyenda sa AMLA, pagrebisa ng Cybercrime Prevention Act, at mga panukala sa Freedom of Information at Crowdsourcing.May tatlong taon pa sa puwesto si Guingona at matatapos ang kaniyang term sa 2016.PSN ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:Sa RA 10368, gagamitin ang nabawing yaman ng mga Marcos sa pagbabayad ng kompensasyon sa mga biktima ng mga pang-aabuso noong panahon ng batas militar.Samantala, itinanghal pati ng ibang bansa ang AMLA amendments ni Guingona bilang mariing dagok sa corruption at pag-iimbak ng ilegal na yaman.Dahil sa mga amyenda ni Guingona, hindi na lang mga bangko ang sa­kop ng AMLA. Bina­bantayan na rin ang mga kuwarta padala, sang­laan, real estate, stock ex­change, sugalan, at foreign exchange bilang posibleng lagusan ng perang nagmula sa mga ipinagbabawal na gawain.Isa sa mga pinakabatang batas ng bansa ay likha rin ni Guingona, ang National Design Po­licy Law. Sinabi ni Guingona na solusyon ito para magamit ang pag-disenyo, hindi lamang ng mga produktong Pinoy, kundi ng mga solusyon sa mga problema ng lipunan.Nag-iisang senador na hindi bumoto para sa Cybercrime Prevention Act, pinangunahan ni Guin­­gona ang paglaban sa pagpapatupad ng batas na pang­harang sa internet freedom. Kasama ang libu-­libong ‘netizen’ o Pinoy internet users, matagum­pay na nahad­langan sa Supreme Court ang pag-iral ng kontrobersyal na batas.",

    "body": "SHAH ALAM, Malaysia — Security videos showing the estranged half brother of North Korea’s leader being attacked at a Malaysian airport and the two suspects hurrying away afterward were presented at their murder trial Wednesday.Kim Jong Nam was seen arriving at the departure hall at the budget terminal of the Kuala Lumpur international airport the morning of Feb. 13 and moving to a check-in area. A woman identified in court as Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong approaches Kim at the check-in counter and clasps both hands on his face from behind before fleeing.The second suspect, Indonesian Siti Aisyah, can’t be seen attacking Kim, but police officer Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz testified that he identified her as a person seen in the video running away in a different direction.Wan Azirul told the court that Huong’s manner was “aggressive” and she didn’t apologize to Kim, like she did to another person she approached in a similar manner at the airport two days earlier. A video of that encounter, which was described as a practice session for smearing Kim’s face with VX nerve agent, was also shown to the court.Both women are seen hurrying to separate restrooms, holding their hands away from their bodies as if to avoid contact. Wan Azirul testified that their hands were in normal positions after they left the restrooms. He said that there were restrooms on the floor where the attack took place, but that the women had gone to restrooms one floor down.After they came out of the restrooms, he said the women headed to the airport taxi stand.Video footage showed Huong, wearing a white long-sleeve top emblazoned with the letters “LOL” – the acronym for laughing out loud – and a blue skirt, waiting at the taxi stand. Aisyah, dressed in a gray sleeveless top, jeans and a scarf, then arrived and got into a taxi that appeared to be waiting for her while Huong was still in the taxi line.Prosecutors contend the women knew they were handling poison, and a chemical weapons expert who testified earlier said VX could be removed safely by careful hand-washing. The expert, who is a government chemist, also testified that he detected traces of VX on Huong’s fingernail clippings and the women’s clothing, and that the amount of VX detected on Kim’s face exceeded a fatal dose.Their defense lawyers have said Huong and Aisyah were duped by suspected North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a TV show.“She seemed to be anxious,” Wan Azirul told the court. “From my observation, Doan has been informed and knew what needed to be done. Even though she seemed to be in panic, she knew what to do.”Huong and Aisyah have pleaded not guilty to murder charges that carry a mandatory death sentence if they are convicted.The videos were a combination of footage captured from cameras around the airport. The two women appeared to be on their own and there was no indication that they knew each other.Earlier, the court was shown video footage of Huong buying a taxi voucher at the airport two hours before the attack on Kim. Aisyah, meanwhile, was seen in another security video meeting with an unidentified man at a cafe near the attack area 45 minutes earlier.Video showed the man, wearing a black baseball cap and glasses, arriving at the cafe holding a white plastic bag. He then set up his cellphone on a selfie stick on a table just before Aisyah arrived. They chatted and had a drink, and the man handed a ticket to Aisyah before she left. Wan Azirul later identified the ticket as a taxi voucher.The judge, lawyers and the two suspects are expected to visit the crime scene next week.",

    "body": "“There is no need for a Plan B,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in June, when asked what Canada would do if NAFTA renegotiations failed.Canada, Trudeau told the New York Times, was confident the free trade deal could be salvaged.That is Mexico’s preferred option as well, but fears the Trump administration in the U.S. will end the accord are driving new thinking about trade as Mexico enters its 2018 presidential campaign in a changed political landscape.The government of Enrique Pena Nieto might already be implementing a Plan B of sorts as it tries to sign as many trade deals as possible to replace the country that buys 80 per cent of its exports.Pena Nieto’s country sends 80 per cent of its exports to the U.S., but President Donald Trump’s threats to sink NAFTA have Pena Nieto looking elsewhere for trade deals. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)An unlikely new right-left coalition has emerged to challenge the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and to stop left-wing firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Some of the coalition’s members are pushing a Plan C that would lead to the elimination of all tariffs in an effort to turn Mexico into a Latin Singapore.Mexico is also drawing closer to China, hoping to send a message to the U.S. that its southern neighbour has other dance partners.Stay the courseJose Antonio Meade quit as Mexico’s finance minister last month to focus on his campaign to succeed President Enrique Pena Nieto as standard-bearer of the PRI in the July 1 election.If Meade wins, Mexico would likely continue the policies of Pena Nieto.If he loses, it might do the same anyway.Before the rise of Trump, Mexico’s business community generally assumed the main threat to NAFTA came from within, courtesy of Lopez Obrador. But he’s cooled his anti-trade rhetoric of late, and now acknowledges that 23 years of free trade have been net-positive for Mexico.His election might make it more difficult to make concessions to save NAFTA, but would not lead automatically to a Mexican pullout.Jose Antonio Meade is looking to carry on Nieto’s trade policies if he can succeed him as leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. (Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press)Mexico’s other major left-wing party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), last week formed a coalition with the centre-right National Action Party (PAN).It’s widely assumed the coalition’s candidate will be PAN’s Ricardo Anaya, and that the coalition will adopt PAN’s pro-NAFTA platform.So today, the only credible threat to NAFTA comes from outside Mexico, courtesy of U.S. President Donald Trump. Or as the Mexicans call him, “el loco del norte.”Plan B, C, D…The Mexican government has followed some of the same steps as the Trudeau government — touring China, talking to the European Union — but unlike Canada, which has pledged not to walk away from NAFTA negotiations, Mexico says it may.“If the conditions aren’t there, it’s better to get out of the free trade deal and adapt to the rules established by the World Trade Organization,” Ernesto Cordero, president of Mexico’s Senate, has said.If NAFTA were to end, the terms of trade between the U.S. and Mexico would be the tariffs fixed under the WTO.Mexico has had some success at finding new markets. In the first half of this year, the proportion of its exports that go to the U.S. fell slightly, largely because exports to Japan, Brazil and the EU grew by 11.3 per cent, 13.5 per cent and 13.7 per cent, respectively. Exports to Canada also grew by 6.2 per cent.Ernesto Cordero, president of the Mexican Senate, right, with Trudeau in Mexico in October. Cordero says if Mexico cannot get a fair trade deal from the NAFTA renegotiations, his country should walk away. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)Alejandro Luna, a trade lawyer with the large Mexico City firm of Santamarina and Steta, says he and others have called for greater trade diversification over the years, but the threat to NAFTA seems to have helped produce results.“The renegotiation finally opened our eyes.”Mexico’s trade negotiators are in talks with the EU to modernize a 20-year-old free trade agreement. They’re also having discussions with Brazil and Argentina, and with the European Free Trade Area of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Mexico is looking to buy more corn from Argentina and Brazil as part of a conscious effort to give the U.S. a taste of the pain its farmers could expect if NAFTA ends.“Diversification is coming about,” Luna said. “But it will take some years, and even then, the U.S., and to an extent Canada, will still be our predominant trade partners.”China to the rescue?Mexico sent its first shipment of blueberries to China last summer, as trade between the two countries continues to grow.But experts are skeptical the Chinese market can solve Mexico’s trade issues should the NAFTA talks fail.“It’s become very sexy to talk about replacing trade with the U.S. with trade with China,” said Enrique Dussel Peters, an economist at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and co-ordinator of its Centre for Mexico-China Studies. “It’s as if one could simply start sending to China, automatically and massively, the same cars we now send to North America.“Anyone who’s ever been involved in a company or a production chain knows it just isn’t so.”Pena Nieto, right, walks with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last month. Mexico’s plan to expand its trade relationships abroad includes greater trade with China. (Andy Wong/Associated Press)In fact, Mexico’s trade with China is even more unbalanced than America’s, he said.“They sell us 14 times as many goods as we sell them.”He said Mexico’s best options outside of NAFTA lie in modernizing and making more use of its free trade agreements with more than 40 countries and blocs worldwide.Doors wide openOne of the more radical trade proposals floating around Mexico City involves turning the country into a tariff-free zone.Senator Francisco Burquez Valenzuela of PAN says that if the U.S. closes itself off, Mexico should respond by making itself more open.He’s proposed a five-year transition to a regime of totally free trade, aimed at lowering prices for Mexican consumers and cutting costs for Mexican manufacturers.Dussel Peters says the plan is “completely unrealistic” and would actually decimate entire sectors of Mexican manufacturing.But it shows the kind of thinking that’s occurring in a country where there’s less optimism about NAFTA’s survival than there is in Canada.Trade lawyer Alejandro Luna says Mexico has been encouraged by Canadian support, particularly during Trudeau’s recent trip to Mexico City, which calmed fears that Mexico would be thrown under the bus by its NAFTA partners.“We do feel that we have an ally in this negotiation. We recognize that each side will have its own interests and needs, but we feel that we can count on Canada to back up the NAFTA agreement as a whole.”Dussel Peters says Mexican industry is also coming to the realization that the end of NAFTA wouldn’t mean the end of trade with the U.S. Supply chains are too integrated and the investments are too big to be dismantled just because tariffs tick up a few points.“The real Plan B after NAFTA,” he said, “is to keep on trading with the U.S. and Canada, but to do it without NAFTA.”",

The extremely human like creature with what seems to be ‘angel’ wings as arms appears to have fallen from the sky. It created a buzz on the internet.THE TRUTHArt lovers—as well as people in general—were appalled by a sculpture depicting a fallen angel in gruesome detail that was unveiled in Beijing earlier this week.These pictures are not a real ‘fallen angel’. This extremely realistic artwork was created by Chinese artists, Sun Yuan and Peng Yu.This sculpture, titled ‘Angel,’ depicts a fallen angel in the form of an old woman, her wings devoid of feathers, that seems to be sleeping or perhaps dead. It was made from silica gel, fibreglass, stainless steel, and woven mesh.The two artists are renowned for working with extreme materials such as human fat tissue, live animals and baby cadavers to deal with serious issues like perception, death and the human condition. Fortunately, no baby parts were used for this piece.Their latest piece, entitled ‘Angel’, has just been installed in China’s capital, reported People’s Daily Online.The artist statement on their website cryptically reveals the project’s purpose: highlighting the tension and transition between the supernatural and the mundane. The angel, a transcendent being, has become powerless, unable to carry out God’s will, or to help those who believe in its existence.‘Angel” is not the duo’d first artwork. One of the duo’s earlier works that they call “Old Person’s Home” focused entirely on the elderly.“Old Person’s Home” was created in 2007 and was made up of sculptures of old men in wheelchairs that strongly resembled several world leaders. The sculptures were placed in electric wheelchairs, which were turned on so that the sculptures could randomly bump into each other.Both ‘Angel’ and ‘Old Persons Home’ have also been displayed at the Saatchi Gallery in London.",

Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victim’s family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acosta’s statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12:“… to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.”No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accused’s guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:“(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.”The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Estrella and Aurora were found lifeless and naked in different parts of the house. The three children were then found inside a locked room also dead from stab wounds. They were found by Carlos, Estrella’s husband who just came home from his night duty as a security guard in a bank in Makati City.One of the three suspects surrendered himself to the authorities as his conscience was haunting him and he regretted the crime that he did. The suspect said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN “Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok,” . He also said that they were under the influence of drugs that’s why they did the crime.",

    "body": "Posted by Courtney JesterPosted on Monday, February 17th, 2014Philippine Senator Vicente ‘Tito’ Sotto said in an interview this week that his research on medical marijuana is far better than the ones conducted by US universities over the years.The Senator was quoted saying in an interview with U.S. media that he commissioned a study on the risks versus benefits of medical marijuana in 2012-2013, and found that there are no real medical benefits on the use of marijuana, marijuana oil or Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent (or cannabinoid) of the cannabis plant.The Senator further said that he believes that his study is far more extensive and more ‘believable’ than studies conducted by international organizations and prestigious universities in the United States. He said that this will become his basis going forward on any legalization attempts – medical or otherwise – during his tenure in the much respected Philippine Senate.The study, conducted by researchers from the Esqälera Research Center of the prestigious Eschül Vookle University in Copenhagen, Sotto’s alma mater, involved at least 3,000 cancer participants, half of which received a bong and a year’s supply of marijuana, and the other half received a bong and dried papaya leaves. Sotto said that the findings were conclusive that neither of the two groups showed any increase in survival rates during the span of the study.Public clamor for marijuana legalization in the Philippines has taken an upswing amid the recent recreational marijuana legalization in the United States, particularly in the states of Colorado and Washington.Sotto, a charismatic and beloved Senator, is known for his very original exemplary speeches, one of which received rave reviews from constituents and academe, with many comparing it to Robert Kennedy’s 1966 Day of Affirmation speech, a well revered piece of America Rhetoric. Sotto holds a Doctor of Philosphy degree from Eschül Vookle University. Award-winning Philippine cinema personalites José María Ramos de León, and Sotto’s brother Marvic Castelo Sotto are some of the other famous alumni of the university.",

The summit dwells on 5 key issues such as the economy, social policy, peace and human rights, anti-corruption and governance, and foreign policy.According to the article in interaksyon.com, the proposals will be submitted to members of Duterte’s cabinet, leaders of Congress and the government and NDFP peace panels.Any thoughts on this development?Source: Interaksyon.comCommentscomments",

    "body": "Boeing Co. and Bombardier Inc. went head to head on Monday over the U.S. plane maker’s claim that its Canadian rival used billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to dump its newest jetliner in the United States at below cost.At a contentious hearing of the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), Boeing accused Bombardier of harming its ability to sell 737s in the U.S. market, in one of the final stages of a bitter trade dispute due to conclude in February.Bombardier argued Boeing’s large 737 order book shows there has been no adverse impact from its C Series jet. “Boeing is making money hand over fist. And with a backlog of 737 orders years into the future, there are no signs of difficulty on the horizon,” Bombardier representative Peter Lichtenbaum said in opening remarks.If the ITC sides with Boeing, as it has so far, it could effectively keep U.S. airlines from using Bombardier’s C Series jet by imposing duties of nearly 300 per cent, one of the largest ever imposed for a market-based economy, Boeing said.“These investigations have already established beyond question that Bombardier has taken billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to prop up its C Series program. The C Series would not even exist at this point but for those subsidies,” Boeing said in a statement emailed during Bombardier’s panel remarks.The U.S. Department of Commerce is due to finalize the proposed duties on Monday or Tuesday. If Bombardier wins, Chicago-based Boeing says its smallest 737 model could face unfair competition from the C Series for decades.Canada’s Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton warned that a positive finding of material harm to Boeing by the ITC could present a possible violation of World Trade Organization agreements and prompt a more formal complaint with the global trade group.“Boeing’s assertion that future imports from Canada threaten to cause material injury is necessarily based on just the type of speculation and conjecture that is prohibited under both U.S. and international law,” MacNaughton told the panel.Canada earlier this month scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Ottawa’s anger over the trade challenge. Boeing has said it considered all potential risks before deciding to launch its trade case.The case stems from an April 2016 sale of 75 C Series jets to Delta Air Lines Inc. Boeing claims Delta paid $20 million US per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33 million US and what Bombardier charges in Canada.“A single large order, like Bombardier’s sale to Delta, takes years of demand out of the market. In this industry, if we lose a sale, it’s gone forever. That’s years of lost production and deliveries for Boeing, years of lost work for our employees, and years of lost work for our U.S. suppliers,” Boeing executive vice-president Kevin McAllister said.Canadian Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton went to bat on Bombardier’s behalf at a trade hearing in Washington on Monday. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)European plane maker Airbus SE, which is buying a controlling stake in the C Series program and has a competing plane, has said it would add a second C Series production line to a factory in Alabama, making it a U.S. product for domestic airlines.Boeing says that should not negate the duties because Airbus and Bombardier would import fuselages and wings and merely be assembling in the United States. But Bombardier argues that Boeing’s case is against full imports of airplanes, not parts, so it does not apply to imports of wings, fuselages and other pieces.Bombardier says more than half of the value of C Series content comes from the United States, including engines by Pratt & Whitney.Boeing says the Delta deal was market defining because other airlines will demand the same low price and the planes will be in service for decades. All jetliners are sold below cost initially because airlines are taking a risk on a new jet model and upfront development costs are high, Bombardier argues.The cost drops over time as the factory produces more planes and gets better at making them. The U.S. plane maker said Bombardier failed to co-operate in a U.S. investigation providing pricing information to the United States.Bombardier said it turned over the Delta sales contract but cannot accurately estimate the cost and price of those planes because they are being built and delivered in coming years. Boeing says the C Series would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada and Britain and a $1 billion US equity infusion from the province of Quebec.Those subsidies are not prohibited because they are either market-based investments or repayable loans, Bombardier said. Bombardier also argues that Boeing and Airbus do not compete with the C Series because their planes are larger and have more range.The C Series’ more direct competitors are smaller jets made by Embraer Mitsubishi.The C Series poses no threat to the U.S. aerospace industry because building it at the Airbus factory in Alabama would create U.S. jobs and generate billions of dollars in business for U.S. aerospace companies, Bombardier said.",

Until today. Well, she did not actually spoke about the issue her name is being dragged in, but people of the interwebs firmly believe not only that the person in the photos are indeed Toni Fowler but also that her slashing her wrist was because of the issue.Well, as we have always said about every other dramas on social media in the past: see for yourselves and you be the judge.

President Rodrigo Duterte says the guns will be used to fight against the terrorists in Mindanao, where martial law still reigns. The first batch of military equipment came in four cargo planes, worth an estimated ₱590 million, and were turned over to the Philippine government at Clark Airbase, Pampanga. President Duterte was quick to express his gratitude to the Chinese government for their aid against the ISIS-aligned militants currently besieging Marawi City.“To Ambassador Zhao, please relate our sincerest thanks to President Xi Jinping and the government of the People’s Republic of China for its military aid package I will receive today in behalf of the Philippine government,” he said. The Philippines’ commander-in-chief said this contract was “the dawn of a new era of Philippine-Chinese relations.” Duterte was, of course, referring to the several new business agreements between the Philippines and China. The Philippine head of state met with Chinese President Xi Jinping many times in the past. President Duterte said: “This not only strengthens our country’s commitment to support each other during times of need, but also highlights the dawn of a new era in Philippine-Chinese relations.” Your Excellency, Mr. President, I know you are fighting terrorism, ISIS-related terrorism in the south. China is also a victim of terrorism.” The ambassador added that a second batch of weapons will be sent to the Philippines within the coming months. Reportedly, over 71 government troops and 299 Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Marawi City. 246,000 citizens of Marawi have been displaced due to the conflict.Loading...So what can you say about this one?

    "body": "Two bears living in a boreal forest in Canada’s High Arctic millions of years ago munched on too many sweets and didn’t brush their teeth, fossil evidence suggests.As you might imagine, those bears ended up with cavities — something that paleontologists were very excited to see.“These individuals actually suffered from a condition that well, humans also experience,” said Natalia Rybczynski, a research scientist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa who helped excavate and study the fossils.“I’m fascinated … because these are giving you insight into what these animals were actually doing.”That evidence — along with remains of raspberry, blueberry, lingonberry and crowberry plants at the fossil site — suggests that ancient bears had a taste for sugary foods, probably berries, even then.And, as with modern bears, that may have helped them fatten up to hibernate through the polar winter with its 24-hour darkness, Rybczynski and colleagues suggest in a new paper published today in the journal Scientific Reports.Natalia Rybczynski (kneeling) excavates the Beaver Pond site at Strathcona Fiord on Ellesmere Island with post-doctoral Ashley Ballantyne in July 2006. They found some Protarctos bones on this field trip. (Dara Finney)The bear fossils were found at a site on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut.While that area today is a frozen, barren, polar desert, 3.5 million years ago during the Pliocene (about the time when the ancient human relative Lucy roamed in Africa), it was about 20 degrees warmer — though it still dipped to one or two dozen degrees below zero in winter.Ancient beaver pondAt that time, one of the first boreal forests grew there, providing a home to animals like beavers, small deer, three-toed horses — and, it appears, bears. The “Beaver Pond site” is one of very few fossil sites in the Arctic, and one of the only sites with mammal fossils, Rybczynski told CBC News: “So it’s a really important window into the past.”This is closeup of the excavation area at the Beaver Pond site. While you have to chisel fossils out of the rock at fossil sites further sites further south, at the Beaver Pond site you use a trowel to dig out felt-like peat. (Canadian Museum of Nature)While you have to chisel fossils out of the rock at fossil sites further south, at the Beaver Pond site you use a trowel to dig out felt-like peat full of well-preserved wood, leaves and pine cones.“You have to pick up chunks of peat, and you sort of like peel it apart, and sometimes there’s a bone in there,” Rybczynski said. The bones are usually fragments broken up by freezing and thawing, chocolate brown in colour or iridescent blue due to the formation of a mineral called vivianite.The first pieces of a bear’s skull were found by now-retired Museum of Nature paleontologist Dick Harington in the 1990s.Other pieces of the skull, a jaw, and pieces of skeleton were excavated over 14 years. They were found to belong to two bears, one a young adult bear likely between five and seven years old and another who was older. Both had cavities in their teeth.Cavities are also found in up to 44 per cent of modern black bears, which fatten up on berries before hibernation, but are rare in other animals, Rybczynski said.Composite laser scans show recovered pieces of the skull of Protarctos abstrusus. Based on the size of the skull, it grew to be about 100 kilograms, or slightly smaller than a modern black bear. (Canadian Museum of Nature)Missing linkOne reason the discovery is exciting is that the fossils are a missing link between primitive and modern bears, said Xiaoming Wang, lead author of the study. Wang, head of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum, says it suggests that bears likely began eating a high-sugar diet to fatten up and then hibernate very early in their evolutionary history.“I can’t really imagine that these animals could really still sustain an active lifestyle through the winters,” he added.Closeup of the upper teeth of Protarctos abstrusus from the Beaver Pond site. Cavities were found in the teeth, suggesting that the bear ate a lot of sugary foods, probably fruit. (Canadian Museum of Nature)The bear grew to be about 100 kilograms, making it slightly smaller than modern black bears that it looked quite similar to. However, Wang says it wasn’t a direct ancestor of modern black bears, which are known to have crossed into North America from Asia much later, during the last ice age.The researchers can’t be sure whether the fossil bears they found were male or female, but one of the fossils includes canine teeth, which are typically much larger in males than females. Wang said their size leads him to believe the animal was male, but he can’t tell without having other specimens of the same species to compare to.This bear isn’t a new species — a tooth from the bear of the same species was found in Idaho in 1970 and given the scientific name Ursus abstrusus. But scientists couldn’t get much information from a single tooth.The fossils excavated from Ellesmere Island provide a lot more information and a “rare glimpse” into life in the High Arctic at that time, Wang said.",

Leila De Lima, vocal critic of President Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, was once again issued an arrest warrant that alleges she was involved in “the proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison during her term as Justice secretary.”According to Sen. De Lima’s legal counsel, Alexandra Padilla, the arrest warrant was issued on June 21, 2017 by Judge Amelia Fabros-Corpuz of the Muntinlupa RTC. The warrant also includes Jose Adrian Dera a.k.a. Jad De Vera.De Lima’s legal counsel is pushing for the arrest warrant to be dropped, seeing it as the weakest among the 3 drug cases that De Lima currently faces from the Department of Justice (DOJ).Senator De Lima is still currently under the custody of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in their custodial center located within Camp Crame. She was arrested and detained on February 23, 2017, also for drug charges. Judge Juanita Guerrero ordered her arrest.The DOJ accused De Lima and Dera of conspiring to extort money from Peter Co, an inmate in Bilibid. Co claims in an affidavit that Dera blackmailed him by detaining and threatening his niece, Sally. Co claims Dera received 2 out of the 5 million pesos that he extorted from the inmate. Dera also allegedly took 4 of Co’s vehicles and used them during Sen. De Lima’s 2016 campaign. Co adds that Dera received 3 million pesos from Co’s niece, which he used to finance Sen. De Lima’s campaign.In an interview with GMA, Padilla said:GMA News wrote:What do you think of this recent development? Share your opinion in the comments section.",

Alam nya na ‘di kayang gawin yun,” Trillanes saidThe results of the SWS survey which was conducted among 1,500 Filipino adults nationwide last September 23-27 was released on Sunday.The third quarter survey showed that only 35 percent of the adult Filipinpos believed that most of Duterte’s promises would be fulfilled. This is a 17-point decrease as compared to previous quarter March’s 52 percent.According to SWS this figure is obviously lower than the number of people who firmly believed that the President could achieve his promises in September 2016 which stood at 56 percent.Malacañang also said there was nothing unsual in the double-digit dropof expectations as “the euphoria of theelections normally wears off after a year in office and people become more realistic on what the government can deliver.” they said“This has been the trend in previous administrations.”“What matters is Filipinos remain satisfied when they gave the current administration a ‘very good’ over-all performance rating at +58, as reflected in the same survey,” said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque in his statement last Sunday.Source: Inquirer.NetCommentscomments",

Many big names as well as lesser known artists have been reported to be involved in startup and big businesses alike.Now, it’s young actress Liza Soberano‘s turn to unveil her own business HOPE Hand and Foot Wellness in Quezon City yesterday.In a report from ABS-CBN, the young star shared the inspiration behind her wellness spa.“Wellness is not just something you do now. It’s forever. You can do it whenever you want, wherever you want and when you start practicing wellness rituals you can bring that with you forever and it could possibly make you feel younger even as you aged. And where I see my wellness center going is I want it to be bigger.“I want it to be a platform for most Filipinos who aren’t educated enough about wellness rituals that it’s about time they start acknowledging wellness as part of their daily routine.”She went on to say that it was her aunt Frances from the US who urged her to go with the business.The interest initiated from Liza Soberano’s obsession with essential oil products eight months ago. The calming effects that the oils bring convinced the “My Ex and Whys” lead to include them in her daily routine.“When I would meditate I would use it, when I am going to sleep I would mix it with the diffuser just to help me fall asleep faster so that’s how it all started.”Despite her currently thriving career, Liza was able to push through with the business, thanks to her aunt and family who guide her in every step of the way.While she has nothing but admiration for other celebrity entrepreneurs, the anticipated Darna singled out her business as she talked about it during the interview,“I really respect my fellow celebrities who are going into business because it shows that they are mature and that they are future-looking and that they are money-savvy. But there are other celebrities that do have something similar to the business that I have now but what I can say is that HOPE Hand and Foot Wellness center focuses on the wellness as a mindset and as a lifestyle and as a ritual.“And it’s not just for the hand and the feet and hopefully in the future we can come up with more wellness treatments and hopefully wellness products to make people feel better about themselves. We want people to walk out of here feeling regenerated.”What can you say about Liza Soberano having her own business at such a young age? Would you like to visit HOPE Hand and Foot Wellness?

But this elderly couple in Exeter, Devon, England is selling some of their appliances that have been bought way back in the 1950s. It’s kind of unbelievable but apparently, the said appliances are in “full working order.” However, the couple originally bought most of it in 1956.According to the report, Sydney and Rachel Saunders are selling their tumble dryer, boiler, cooker, and washing machine. Sydney, a retired accountant, believed that “things were made better” back in the days.Meanwhile, Rachel wanted to donate their appliances to a museum so that it could inspire the new generation about the durability of things, particularly technology.The items are miraculously still in working condition, although the washing machine has a “slightest of leaks.” The elderly couple included a Servis washing machine in their sale, which was bought in 1956 for £60 (PHP 4,042.60). They bought it when they were still newlyweds.Sydney admitted, “That was a lot of money in those days.”They are also selling a Baby Belling cooker bought in 1956 for £19 (PHP 1,280.16), a Burco tumble dryer bought in 1963 for £52 (PHP 3,503.59), and a five-gallon boiler bought in 1959 for around £15 (PHP 1,010.65).The elderly couple decided to sell some of their appliances after they had a general cleaning of their house. According to them, most of the appliances were only “spares” in the house, hence their impressive conditions.Sydney revealed:“Things were made better in those days, they were more durable and stronger, but of course the new ones are more sophisticated. That’s a good thing, but it means that if something goes wrong it can be quite a big job. I think a lot more care was taken in older days.” “We’re selling them now because over the years we have replaced them. We’ve kept them as spares for a number of years even though they have been replaced and we thought it was a good opportunity to clear the house out.”Rachel, a retired carer, added:“We were given the washing machine when we were married – 62 years ago – and the last time it was used was 12 years ago. As far as I know it’s still in full working order, it just leaks a bit. The tumble dryer was brought around when our first daughter was born and is about 55 years old.” “I’ve used it every week ever since up to a couple of months ago. It’s still in working order and all you have to do is put the clothes in and switch it on. It’s quite simple – just place the clothes forwards and backwards and then put it through the rollers. The last time the cooker was used was 28 years ago and it was working fine then.”The elderly couple shared that they hoped the appliances would go to a museum or a good house. Rachel said:“It would be such a shame for them just to go to landfill so we’d really like someone who is interested in them to come forward. You just don’t get appliances made like that today. We don’t know what they’re worth, but the money isn’t important, we just want them to go to a good home.” “We’ve been here for 60 years and we’ve kept them for spares for years, but now we’ll never use them again and it’s time we found a good home for them.. I’m not bothered about the price, I’d like them to go to a museum or something like that so they can be preserved.”As of this writing, nobody has purchased the mentioned appliances yet.Amazing! What do you think about the elderly couple selling their antique appliances in mint condition? Were you impressed? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!",

(Tadeco) in the province of Davao del Norte.Castriciones assured the farmers that the DAR will immediately look into their demands and directed the field operations and legal services units of the department to fast-track resolution of the appeal for the issuance of the installation order.The new DAR chief said the Duterte administration is accelerating the process of releasing certificates of land ownership awards (CLOAs) of the ARBs and the provision of support programs and services.The office of Quezon City ViceMayor Joy Belmonte took care of food packs and boxes of bottled water needed by the Mindanao farmers for their long journey home.The farmers also received scholarship certificates from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority through the office of Deputy Director Diosdado Padilla.Despite the heavy rains on Monday, the dismantling of the tents and camps previously set up by the farmers in front of the DAR central office went on.The farmers left Quezon City around 10 p.m. on Monday.",

Huwag na lang tayo magbolahan,” President Duterte said on Wednesday, November 22. (You’re terrorists, including your legal fronts. I know. Let’s not fool each other.)On Thursday, November 23, Duterte also said he would consult with security and intelligence agencies on which communist “legal fronts” are conspiring to commit terrorism, saying the existence of a conspiracy is enough to charge them.“Duterte is the No. 1 terrorist in the Philippines. He is culpable for the abduction, torture, and mass murder of an increasing large number of poor people suspected drug users and pushers, peasants and indigenous people in suspected guerrilla fronts and Moro people suspected of aiding the Dawlah Islamiyah from the time of the indiscriminate bombing of Marawi City to the present in several Bangsamoro areas,” Sison said in a statement on Thursday.“And yet Duterte is utterly malicious and shameless in threatening and scheming to label and outlaw as terrorists the suspected members and entireties of such revolutionary organizations as the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People´s Army and even such legal patriotic and progressive organizations as BAYAN and its affiliates,” he added.This is but the latest in the word war between the President and his former professor, Sison.In July, Sison called Duterte the “number one drug addict” in the country who should be the target of the police.“As an addict user of the opioid fentanyl, Duterte is the number one drug addict in the Philippines and is the most fitting target of the police units that he has turned into death squads and corrupted with money and promotions,” the CPP founder said.This was after the President claimed Sison was dying of cancer, which the professor denied.At the time, Sison also described the President as a “coward through and through” for failing to fulfill his threats to kill alleged drug lord Peter Lim as well as Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino Jr and retired police officer Marcelo Garbo whom he has all accused of being drug protectors.On Thursday, Sison also said: “Duterte´s bloodlust and mania for mass murder are boundless. He expects to wipe out through arbitrary arrests, torture, indefinite detention and massacre of suspected revolutionaries and legal social activists.”SOURCe: Rappler",

The rebel group's founder even advised the Philippine President to go see a professional psychiatrist because he has a \"sick mind\".\"I pity him and I am tempted just to let him go because what he says against me is patently baseless and comes obviously from a sick mind,\" Sison said in a Facebook post.\"But I still have to answer him to prevent him from misleading the public and rousing them the wrong way. At any rate, he has to look after his mental health and consult with a professional psychiatrist,\" Sison added.Sison also berated the President after the latter advised him to just kill himself to lessen the burden he is giving to the Norwegian government due to his disease. Sison escaped to Europe in 1987 when the failed to pursue.\"Sison, tumanda ka na lang diyan. Ayaw mo pa aminin na may sakit ka. Maawa ka naman sa Norwegian government.

He asked if he is having a good time with the so-called extrajudicial killings.\"First, he threatened to kill me. Now, he tells me to commit suicide. Is this another symptom of a malady in which the sick person enjoys boasting of having police units and death squads that commit extrajudicial killings with impunity and with monetary rewards per victim?\" He ended.Durng the second SONA of President Duterte at the Batasan Complex, he revealed that Jose Maria Sison has colon cancer, adding that the RNG is paying most of his medical treatment.

But, what they didn't know that this can cause some serious and dangerous health problems.Most doctors would recommend against the practice of squirting water, or fluids into the vagina because it changes the natural balance of healthy bacteria and can make it easier to pick up infections.One survey discovered that 29% of 232 people actually admitted that they are regularly washed and 57% admitted that they never did it.Based on this research it was discovered that flushing can be related to pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, fungal infections and reduced fertility.Experts link this so called vagina self cleaning with many other health diseases like reduced fertility, yeast infections, pelic inflammatory disease, different kind of infections etc.Joelle Brown is epidemiology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and she was not involved in the study, but she said that link between douching and ovarian cancer took her by surprise.Even though, almost all of the gynecologist and doctors do not recommend douching as a method of cleaning the vagina, some women continue to do it, watching only the positive side of it, that is better hygiene.",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Friday, April 1st, 2016In a shocking development, the Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ), under orders from Malacanang, today released Janet Lim-Napoles, the suspected mastermind of the controversial pork barrel scam from prison. The DOJ cited the government’s inability to pay for the cost of her incarceration, and lack of evidence as reasons for Napoles’ untimely release.DOJ Secretary Leila de Lima said that the government can no longer sustain Napoles’ incarceration due to lack of funding, lack of evidence, and Napoles’ refusal to incriminate the members of congress whom she had allegedly sent millions in kick backs to.De Lima said that the government has done as much as it can within its powers to get Napoles to confess her alleged involvement in the scandal, but it had failed to gain credible evidence and failed to get Napoles to pin the senators and other members of congress to the allegations set forth by the whistle-blowers. They have tried everything in the book, and went as far as piping in depressing music — looped to play 24 hrs a day for two weeks — into Napoles’ cell.“Sinubukan na namin lahat, kahit magpatugtog ng depressing music, para lang ma coerce siya to tell all,” De Lima said. “But that didn’t work either,” she adds.When asked what songs they played, De Lima said that they downloaded MP3 copies of the songs “Sandra” by Barry Manilow, and the 1971 hit “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby” by Vilma Santos. They loaded them into an MP3 player and had the songs played in a continuous loop, 24 hours a day in Napoles’ prison cell for two weeks straight.According to De Lima however, instead of driving Napoles into a confession, the songs appeared to have a positive effect on her, even to the point where it raised her spirits. Indeed, surveillance videos show Napoles dancing to the beat of “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby” after a week, making the strategy a miserable failure.Janet Lim-Napoles voluntarily surrendered to president Aquino several months over a year ago, after she was bared as the alleged mastermind by several whistle-blowers, lead by her former employee Ben Hur Luy, of a kick back scheme with some members of congress. The illegal setup entailed funneling millions of pesos intended for development projects at the lawmakers’ congressional districts, into the private pockets of the lawmakers who were involved.Napoles is now in an undisclosed location. However, rumor has it that she is applying to immigrate to China to work for the Chinese government, financing projects for communications company ZTE, and handling finances for other government officials.Her attorney has yet to make a statement as of this writing.",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines - Sen. Leila de Lima collected 1 billions from high-profile inmates in New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City when she was still justice secretary in the previous administration.This was the common allegation raised by several inmates in their affidavits submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Drug and robbery convict Herbert Colangco revealed that the Carcel Side, a coalition of gangs of inmates from the Visayas and Mindanao which he leads, had given De Lima P3 million per month.Carcel is one of the two factions of inmates in the national penitentiary with over 7,000 members belonging to the Oxo Allied Group. The other is the Presidio Side led by drug convict Jaybee Sebastian with over 5,000 inmates, mostly from Luzon.In a four-page affidavit obtained by The STAR, Colangco explained that the amount was for “payola” to then DOJ secretary De Lima “para sa pribilehiyo sa amin at para maipagpatuloy din ang mga negosyo sa Bilibid (for privileges accorded to us and also for our businesses inside the NBP to continue).”“Sa tantiya ko po, ang umiikot na halaga ng droga sa loob ng Bilibid sa pagpayag ni secretary De Lima bago pa kami ilipat sa NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) ay hindi bababa sa limampung milyong piso kada buwan (By my estimate, the amount of illegal drug trade inside the NBP upon permission of secretary De Lima before we were transferred to NBI would not be lower than P50 million per month),” bared the self-styled musician who even managed to produce music videos inside the penitentiary.Apart from illegal drug trade, Colangco confessed that he also ventured into selling beer inside the NBP during De Lima’s time. He said he was allowed to sell beer in can to thousands of inmates during events at NBP for more than 10 times the original price per can and would earn P3 million for 300 boxes.“Ang share ni secretary De Lima sa pag-aapruba sa pagpasok nito ay P1 million. Ito po ay dinadala ng tao kong si Rey sa DOJ o kinukuha ng tao ni secretary De Lima na si Joenel Sanchez (kasama sa security ni De Lima) at ng kanyang boyfriend na si Ronnie Dayan (secretary De Lima’s share for approving the entry of beer was P1 million.It was either delivered by my courier Rey to DOJ or picked up by secretary De Lima’s security aide Joenel Sanchez and her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan),” Colangco further alleged in his notarized affidavit.Colangco, head of the notorious Ozamiz robbery gang, recalled that when he and other high-profile inmates were transferred to the NBI in 2014, Sebastian then had a monopoly of illegal drug trade and other illicit activities inside the NBP.“Ang hindi susunod sa kanyang gusto ay tinatakot na ipapatapon. Naniniwala ang mga tao sa loob ng Bilibid na pwedeng gawin ito sa kanila ni Jaybee Sebastian dahil alam nila ito ay malapit kay secretary De Lima lalo na sa boyfriend nito na si Ronnie Dayan (Those who will defy him were warned to be thrown away.People in the NBP believe that he is capable of doing that because he is known to be close with secretary De Lima, especially with her boyfriend Ronnie Dayan),” he added in the sworn statement signed last Sept. 1. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has confirmed that Colangco, fellow drug convict Noel Martinez and about 10 other inmates would testify before the House of Representatives inquiry on the proliferation of illegal drugs in the NBP. He revealed that eight of them have been transferred to the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) custody for fear of their lives inside the national penitentiary in Muntinlupa City. Aguirre said some of the witnesses have bared in separate affidavits that they have collected money from illegal drugs since 2013 to support the senatorial bid of then secretary De Lima.The DOJ chief hinted that there is also a witness who delivered P5 million to De Lima’s house in Parañaque City, which was allegedly personally received by the senator and Dayan. Aguirre added that they also received information that De Lima, wearing a disguise, visited the NBP eight times and would go directly to the “kubol” of Sebastian.He said a letter from Sebastian would be submitted to the House on this matter. Aguirre earlier alleged that secretary De Lima brought out “coached witness” Edgar Matobato, who claimed to be a former member of the Davao death squad, in a desperate move to preempt the “explosive” testimonies and evidence to be presented against her in the House probe that will start on Tuesday.",

Recently, “phenomenal star” Maine Mendoza also offered her support to the young man through Instagram.According to Philippine Entertainment Portal, the Kapuso talent sent a direct message to Janica on Twitter. She was quoted as writing:“Hi Janica! I might not know you (and Franco) personally but I really want to send you a message just to say that you are both lucky to have each other.

Stay strong!”Janica shared the conversation through her own Instagram story on Dec. 20, 2017, where she captioned it with the text, “Beautiful inside and out.”It was an indication that Maine Mendoza was sincere about offering her support to the young woman. Even though she is not particularly close to Janica, she managed to send a message that showed how much she sympathized with her about Franco’s untimely passing.Previously, Janica stated that she would no longer talk about his death after being subjected to extreme attention from the netizens and the public in general.She was quoted as posting on her Twitter account:“This will be my first and last interview, i am not blaming anyone or anybody. I am just stating facts and sharing what hapepened during the incident. Why did i just do this now?” “The answer is because i want to respect the solemnity of Franco’s Wake and i was still in trauma of what happened. The reason behind my interview is to correct false information and incorrect news. “I am doing this for Franco and his family, this is the least that i can do for Franco.”Currently, Maine is enjoying her vacation.

They said, ‘You have a large [budget] deficit… maybe this year the projected deficit will be big,’ they said, ’ but [the amount to be returned] won’t be much. ‘But we are ready to open and bring back [the assets],’ they said, ‘including a few gold bars.’”Yes, the Marcoses has finally decided to reach out to the government to talk about their wealth. The announcement is so simple and straightforward, even I had to take a couple of days to digest what happened. Why? Because what may happen, the way the issue was announced, and the political and economic implications of this gesture are discombobulating, to the say the least.The AnnouncementFirst , Duterte clearly said that negotiations are ongoing, and probably without asking the Marcoses if he can make such announcement. Even if the talks are very preliminary, this puts major pressure on the Marcoses. After the surprise announcement will make backing out very politically costly because the public generally hates “#paasa” orSecond , Duterte, aware of the pressure on the Marcoses, apparently tried to decrease it by saying that the amount “won’t be much”. But “not much” is a very relative term, and I think he’s trying to flip the odds to the government’s favor. The Marcoses supposedly raised the idea to help Duterte respond to a looming massive budget deficit so it will be embarrassing for the Marcoses if the talks result to a very small amount.Third , Duterte said he will get impartial people to handle the negotiations: a former chief justice (probably the retired Chief Justice Renato Puno), a Certified Public Accountant, and a universally-recognized representative. This way, he can minimize suspicions by providing a considerable level of transparency.Fourth , Duterte never used the word “stolen”. Duterte used the word “found”, “return”, “help”, and the like, but he never used neither “ill-gotten” nor “stolen”, and here’s where his political realism clearly shows. By not using those two words, he is paving the way for the return of the wealth while at the same time providing the Marcoses some leeway for messaging. After all, they are already trying to return some money, so why do we need to humiliate them right now?Fifth , Duterte also said that he wants to do “something worthwhile for the Filipino”, and I think he’s on his way to doing that. The Philippine Commission on Good Government (PCGG) has been running after Marcos’ wealth for over 30 years with limited success, and here are the Marcoses intending to return money by their own initiative.

Even if we’re just talking about a few tens or hundreds of billions, the amount will still go a long way in helping poor Filipinos.Many camps argue that whatever the Marcoses will return will just be a very small fraction of whatever they got. However, we need to keep two things in mind: [1] the fact that they will willingly return it and [2] the fact that they are confident that the amount will significantly help in reducing the budget deficit, which is expected to have reached P147 billion at the end of July 2017 [Yeah, that’s a LOT of money.But then, if there’s one thing that everybody – regardless of political color – will agree on, it’s that the Marcoses are not stupid, so they expect something in return.What do they expect?The Marcoses, I believe, expect political capital which translates to:1: A possibly softer anti-Marcos stance among the anti-Marcos publicThe Marcos Family may be expecting many anti-Marcos voters, many of whom were born after Martial Law, to soften their anti-Marcos stance even by a bit. While the staunchest Marcos critics probably will never forgive the Marcoses even when hell freezes over, the fact of the matter is that many voters today did not personally experience life under the dictatorship and thus do not hold much of a grudge against the former first family…. or have a favorable view of the Marcoses to begin with. Proof? Bongbong Marcos’ performance in the 2016 Presidential Elections.2: Greater bargaining power under the Duterte Administration The latest initiative of the Marcos’ family is really surprising, in that it totally came out from left field. Who among any of the family’s critics thought something like this can ever happen? Regardless of the amount that will be agreed upon, the mere fact that family is now willing to even talk about it is shocking, to say the least.Many camps argue that whatever the Marcoses will return will just be a very small fraction of whatever they got. However, we need to keep two things in mind: [1] the fact that they will willingly return it and [2] the fact that they are confident that the amount will significantly help in reducing the budget deficit, which is expected to have reached P147 billion at the end of July 2017 [ MT ].Yeah, that’s a LOT of money.But then, if there’s one thing that everybody – regardless of political color – will agree on, it’s that the Marcoses are not stupid, so they expect something in return.What do they expect?The Marcoses, I believe, expect political capital which translates to:The Marcos Family may be expecting many anti-Marcos voters, many of whom were born after Martial Law, to soften their anti-Marcos stance even by a bit.

Proof? Bongbong Marcos’ performance in the 2016 Presidential Elections.I interviewed Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos a couple of weeks ago and I asked her why Duterte doesn’t influence the House of Representatives regarding the Tobacco Excise Tax Hearing plaguing the Ilocos Norte Government, including the governor herself. She said she doesn’t want to impose on the president because “nahihiya”. I am not sure if she is not telling me something, but this may imply that the Marcoses, while influential in Duterte’s inner circle, is not as influential as we think. So how do the Marcoses enhance their influence? By doing the Duterte’s Government a favor.3: A possible “recalibration” of historyIn his speech, Duterte said the Marcos family’s liaison, whoever he or she is, claims that the Ferdinand Marcos took the money to protect the economy in the eventuality that he’s removed from power, in the hopes of regaining Malacañang.I am disinclined to buy this story but truth be told, such a narrative is not a hard sell among a Filipino public that are first hand witnesses to the incompetence and corruption of Marcos’ Archnemesis, the Aquinos, along with their Liberal Party cohorts.The Marcoses, for example, may ask the public, “What if we gave this much earlier and Mar Roxas got it?”.Note, however, that I used the term “recalibration” instead of “rewrite” because I doubt that anybody can drastically change what's already in history books with just one act.When I said “recalibration”, I mean a slightly less diabolical portrayal not necessarily of the Marcos Regime, but that of the living Marcoses who have been, for decades, at the receiving end of criticisms against the late president.With these said, I believe that the Marcos Family’s plans to return the wealth, if realized, will go a long way in making a prospective 2022 BBM presidency palatable for more people, and this will serve as a challenge to other presidential hopefuls to step up their game.Why? Because the Marcoses have already stepped up their game… BIG TIME.Political implications: The Liberal Party If there’s one camp that will be most adversely affected by this development, it’d be the Aquino-aligned Liberal Party of the Philippines, the main political party that cultivated anti-Marcos sentiment and benefitted the most from it.Let’s get a few quotes from senior Liberal Party politicians as they reacted to this news.From Senator and Liberal Party president Francis Pangilinan[\"There is no reason for us to believe in the sincerity of the Marcos family. They should return ill-gotten wealth and apologize for the sins of the dictatorship. Only then we would believe in their sincerity.\" From Senator and Ninoy cosplayer Bam Aquino [Dapat lang ibalik talaga `yan. Now ang tanong magkano po ang porsyentong ibabalik baka naman yung ibabalik po dyan kakarampot lang dun sa totoong ninakaw sa atin. TRANSLATION: It should really be returned. Now, the question is how much will be returned because they just be returning a very small fraction of what they really stole from us. From Vice-president and Liberal Party Chairman Leni Robredo [\"If they are returning the wealth... they should return everything because this belongs to the Filipinos.\"What’s clear in these LP quotes is the party’s insistence on the Marcoses returning ALL of the money, despite them having no idea on how to go about that, while former President Corazon Aquino’s PCGG has been here since the mid-80s, yet it managed to recover nothing but scraps.I think LP’s fear is rooted on their very reason for existing in the first place. In the May 2016  article “Batman once said, “A hero is only as good as his villain,” so what if, in the eyes of the public, the “ultimate” villain turns out to not be as evil as the people thought he was?I am not saying that Ferdie should be a saint... but he sure is not the devil incarnate.Yes, the Aquinos and LP will lose the justification for their existence. Yeah, their most ardent supporters will continue to support them, but I doubt if their numbers would even be enough to elect a provincial governor.The Liberal Party, which is already struggling for survival, will probably struggle even more. If there’s one camp that will be most adversely affected by this development, it’d be the Aquino-aligned Liberal Party of the Philippines, the main political party that cultivated anti-Marcos sentiment and benefitted the most from it.Let’s get a few quotes from senior Liberal Party politicians as they reacted to this news.From Senator and Liberal Party president Francis Pangilinan[ Malaya ]:From Senator and Ninoy cosplayer Bam Aquino [ Abante ]:From Vice-president and Liberal Party Chairman Leni Robredo [ Malaya ]:What’s clear in these LP quotes is the party’s insistence on the Marcoses returning ALL of the money, despite them having no idea on how to go about that, while former President Corazon Aquino’s PCGG has been here since the mid-80s, yet it managed to recover nothing but scraps.I think LP’s fear is rooted on their very reason for existing in the first place. In the May 2016  article “ Quantifying Discontent: An Analysis of the Bongbong Marcos Phenomenon ”, I explained that for the past 30 years, the Aquinos and the Liberal Party painted themselves as the antithesis – the polar opposites – of the Marcoses. The Aquinos and the Liberal Party painted themselves as the ultimate hero as they painted the Marcos Family as the ultimate villain... and therein lies the problem.Batman once said, “A hero is only as good as his villain,” so what if, in the eyes of the public, the “ultimate” villain turns out to not be as evil as the people thought he was?I am not saying that Ferdie should be a saint... but he sure is not the devil incarnate.Yes, the Aquinos and LP will lose the justification for their existence. Yeah, their most ardent supporters will continue to support them, but I doubt if their numbers would even be enough to elect a provincial governor.The Liberal Party, which is already struggling for survival, will probably struggle even more.Political implications: The Duterte PresidencyThat is how a Political Realist thinks. That is how Duterte thinks. Duterte the President, more than anything, is a Political Realist.In the October 2016  article “Duterte’s Political Realism has again become evident when, in response to Marcos’ offer to return some wealth, he said: Individuals and states, while both basing actions on morality, use a different hierarchy of moral principles. For example, the individual may subscribe to the saying “Fiat justitia, pereat mundus (Let justice be done, even if the world perish),” but the state can’t possibly do the same if it threatens the state’s very survival [ Morgenthau 1978 ].That is how a Political Realist thinks. That is how Duterte thinks. Duterte the President, more than anything, is a Political Realist.In the October 2016  article “ Genius! The Method to Duterte’s Foreign Policy Madness ”, I explained how Duterte’s seemingly irrational, morally reprehensible action of cursing at then-US President Barack Obama, actually has a method to it. That is, “calling” Obama a “son of a bitch” made the Chinese public more receptive to Duterte and the Philippines, paving the way for a more independent Philippine foreign policy.Duterte’s Political Realism has again become evident when, in response to Marcos’ offer to return some wealth, he said:“I will accept that explanation (Marcos Family’s alibi), whether or not it is true, we can’t do much about it anyway and they’re ready to return the [the assets].”That is, while many camps would demand the Marcoses to return an arm and a leg, Duterte took into account the PCGG’s general inability to recover assets and the government’s immediate financial needs.Duterte was basically made to choose between:Accepting the alibi then accepting a massive injection into government coffers, and, Rejecting that alibi, which would make the Marcoses retract, as the PCGG spends another 30 years looking for crumbs, with no assurance of success. To Duterte, the choice was obvious: he picked the option that will translate to real improvements to Filipino lives.How many post-Yolanda houses will that build?How many hospitals will it fund?How many roads will that create? Duterte was basically made to choose between:If the negotiations translate to a final deal and the money changes hands, this will cement Duterte’s reputation for being a doer, starkly in contrast to Mar Roxas’ “Yes, there may still be many issues that the Filipino People must settle with the Marcoses. However, this development, if fully realized, will be a victory for all... except for the Liberal Party. All these questions would be useless to ask if Duterte insisted that the Marcoses return everything, whatever “everything” means.If the negotiations translate to a final deal and the money changes hands, this will cement Duterte’s reputation for being a doer, starkly in contrast to Mar Roxas’ “ analysis paralysis ”. This will enhance Duterte’s political capital and by extension, whoever he will endorse in the 2019 and 2022 elections.Yes, there may still be many issues that the Filipino People must settle with the Marcoses. However, this development, if fully realized, will be a victory for all... except for the Liberal Party.DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post?

    "body": "The nation first came to know of newest child sensation Carlo Mendoza when a video of him went viral, even reaching multi-million views on Facebook. In the said video, Carlo Mendoza was in a bad mood, screaming about how people who hurt kids should go to jail, and intensely ranting about what he knows of children’s rights.Reportedly, he was prompted to rant about such things upon witnessing her supposed “older sister” Princess get hit by an elder relative. It was the first time we found out how much Carlo loves his family, especially his sister and mother. He even extended the same love to his mother, even though she no longer lives with them but with her new family.Carlo Mendoza’s ability to feel so much love and empathy impressed TV host and celebrity Vice Ganda, who has invited Carlo as a guest in Gandang Gabi Vice. He adored Carlo so much that he committed himself to pay for the child’s education. Carlo will also appear in Vice’s upcoming film.Being the loving (albeit hot-headed) kid that he is, Carlo returned his ‘Mama Vice’s’ care with affection and youthful sweetness. For Christmas, Carlo gave Vice gifts from VICE Cosmetics, not knowing that the brand actually belonged to Vice himself.Vice Ganda, for his part, splurged on Carlo’s gifts. First, Vice took Carlo and his father on his personalized and luxurious van (which impressed Carlo so much) and took the kid to the mall for a shopping spree. Vice truly lifted a lot of weight off Carlo’s father’s shoulders, as Vice is seen telling Carlo: “Oh, ‘wag ka nang magpapabili sa Tatay ha.”In return, Carlo promised his father: “Hindi na ako magpapabili sa’yo ha. Hindi na rin ako magpupuyat, matutulog na ako kasi binilhan ako ni Mama Vice ng maraming laruan.”However, Vice’s surprises for the little kid did not end there. Watch the video below to see Carlo’s precious reaction upon learning that Vice bought him a lot of expensive toys aside from the ones they bought at the mall:What can you say about Vice’s Christmas treats for Carlo Mendoza? In your opinion, what is it about Carlo that earned Vice Ganda’s affection and love? If you were Carlo, what would you tell Mama Vice? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!",

    "body": "MR. ANTONIO F. TRILLANES, IVSenator – Senate of the PhilippinesManilaDear Mr. Trillanes,Sana po umabot sa inyo itong liham kong ito para naman malaman nyo ang niloloob ng isang mamamayang Pilipino tungkol sa ginawa ninyong may ukol sa sinasabi ninyong tinatagong kayamanan ni Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.Bilang isang Bisaya, hindi po ako sanay sa Tagalog pero Tatagalugin ko po, sa hangganan ng aking makakaya, ang liham na ito para maintindihan ng nakararami.Sa umpisa pa lang gusto kong ilahad na ang liham na ito ay personal kong opinyon at walang kinalaman sa kung ano mang katungkulan na hinahawakan ko sa anumang organisasyong kabilang ako.Ako po ay taga Davao City at sumusuporta po ako sa kandidatura ng aming Mayor na si Rodrigo Duterte.Ako po ay isang abogado at bilang abogado, naiintindihan ko na ang bawat mamamayan ay may kalayaan na maglahad ng kanyang niloloob or nais sabihin sa ilalim ng ating Konstitusyon liban lamang kung ang sasabihin ay makakasama sa dangal o pangalan ng isang tao ng walang matatag na basehan.Ito po ay totoo lalo na kapag isang may katungkulan sa pamahalaan ang nakakatanggap ng pintas mula sa isang mamamayan. Ayon nga sa ating Korte Suprema, hindi maaring balat sibuyas ang mga may katungkulan dahil kaakibat ng kung ano mang kapangyarihan na hawak nila ang pagtanggap ng pintas tungkol sa pamamaraan ng kanilang pagganap sa kanilang tungkulin.Dahil po rito ay di ako gaanong nagbibigay ng pahayag tungkol sa mga tapunan ng batikos ng mga politiko lalo na at eleksyon nga ngayon. Paminsan-minsan dinaraan ko sa pangutyang kalokohan ang niloloob ko pero hindi ko masyadong sineseryoso.Subalit, nung nabasa ko po kaninang umaga ang pinirmahan ninyong Affidavit or Sinumpaang Salaysay, ako po ay tunay na NADISMAYA at medyo NAGALIT. Hindi po ako nagalit dahil si Mayor Duterte ang pinaparatangan ninyo. Di lang po siya magaling na mayor, siya rin po ay magaling na abogado at marami rin siyang mga kasamang magagaling na abogado na kayang-kaya saguting ang mga paratang ninyo. Sinabi ko na nga, bilang isang may katungkulan, kaakibat ito ng kanyang buhay lalo na at tumatakbo sya bilang Presidente ng Pilipinas.Ako po ay NADISMAYA AT NAGALIT dahil po sa aking pagbasa ng inyong pinagmamalaking Affidavit, ay nalaman ko na WALANG KALAMAN LAMAN NA BASEHAN ang inyong mga sinasabi.UNA, sabi po ninyo sa inyong affidavit na ang mga dokumentong ipinapakita ninyo ay nanggaling as isang NAGPAKILALA NG SARILI NYA SA INYO BILANG JOSEPH DE MESA. “NAGPAKILALA”. Ibig po sabihin nito na HINDI NINYO SYA KILALA at wala kayong alam sa pagkatao niya. Sa pagkakaintindi ko nung Abril 21, 2016 lang ninyo sya UNANG nakausap. Mukha namang napakabilis ninyo pinaniwalaan ang isang tao na noon nyo lang nakita lalo na at napakabigat ng kanyang mga paratang. Kung totoong tao talaga ito si JOSEPH DE MESA, hindi kaya mainam na kinunan nyo muna siya ng Sinumpaang Salaysay at kinilala nyo muna an kanyang pagkatao, at siniyasat ng mabuti ang kanyang mga sinasabi, bago nyo isinambulat ang sinasabi nyong mga paratang nya laban kay Mayor Duterte?PANGALAWA, sinabi nyo rin sa inyong Affidavit na AYON KAY JOSEPH DE MESA, ang mga dokumentong ibinigay niya sa inyo ay HINDI GALING SA KANYA, kung hindi nagmula pa sa isang HINDI PINAPANGALANAN at sinasabing malapit na kamag-anak niya na, ayon sa kanya, ay kawani ng isang ahensya, ahensya ng pamahalaan sa pagkakaintindi ko, na nag-iimbistiga ng mga tinatagong kayamanan mula sa pandarambong ng mga may katungkulan sa pamahalaan. Paratang ba ito sa Office of the Ombudsman o sa Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLAC), na sa kanila nagmula ang mga dokumento umano tungkol sa mga bank account ng mga Duterte?Samakatuwid, PINANIWALAAN NINYO AT ISINAMBULAT SA PUBLIKO ang mga paratang ni JOSEPH DE MESA na HINDI NAGMULA SA SARILI NYANG KAALAMAN kung hindi GALING LAMANG RIN sa IPINASA UMANONG IMPORMASYON SA KANYA na NAGMULA sa isang HINDI PINAPANGALANANG KAMAG-ANAK na nagtatrabaho sa isang HINDI PINAPANGALANANG AHENSYA? Hindi naman kayo nagduda man lang kung totoo ba ang mga paratang at dokumentong ipinsasa sa inyo nitong si JOSEPH DE MESA na inaamin naman ninyong IPINASA LANG RIN sa kanya?Sa salitang kalye po ay CHISMIS ang ibinigay sa inyo nitong si JOSEPH DE MESA. Madali po kayong maniwala sa CHISMIS? Hindi lang po yan, ang CHISMIS po ni JOSEPH DE MESA ay nanggaling rin sa CHISMIS na nagmula sa DI PINAPANGALANANG kamag-anak niya na mula sa DI PINAPANGALANANG ahenysa UMANO.Hindi ko po alam sa inyo pero sa amin po ang tawag sa taong madaling maniwala at nagkakalat ng CHISMIS ay CHISMOSO.PANGATLO, sinabi rin po ninyo sa inyong Affidavit na inyong SINURI NG MABUTI, “VETTED” po ang INGLES na ginamit ninyo, ang mga dokumentong ibinigay umano sa inyo nitong si JOSEPH DE MESA. Sa aking kokonting nalalaman sa Ingles ay ang ibig po sabihin ng salitang “VETTED”, lalo na sa mga tulad ninyong nagmula sa militar, ay MASUSING PAGSUSURI. Ibig po sabihin nito ay sinasabi ninyo na tiningnan nyo umano sa masusing paraan at imbestigasyon kung TOTOO BA ang mga dokumentong ibinigay sa inyo at kung totoo ba ang mga nakalahad rito. PAPAANO po ninyo ginawa ang MASUSING PAGSUSURI e sa sinasabi ninyo nung ABRIL 21, 2016 lang kayo nagkita at sa pagkakaalam ko iilang araw lang mula noon ay ISINAMBULAT NA NINYO SA PUBLIKO ang mga paratang ninyo kay Mayor Duterte?ISA PA PO, sa pagkakaalam ko rin ay ITINANGGI NA ng BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS at ng AMLAC na sa kanila nagmula ang mga dokumentong hawak ninyo. PAPAANO PO kayo gumawa ng MASUSING PAGSUSURI kung wala naman kayong maikukumpara sa mga dokumentong ipinasa sa inyo ni JOSEPH DE MESA na, UULITIN KO, nagmula sa HINDI PINAPANGALANANG kamag-anak na kawani sa isang HINDI PINAPANGALANANG ahensya?Ang sinabi nyo po sa inyong Affidavit ay SINURI NINYO at ng mga ACCOUNTANT NINYO ang mga dokumento sa pamamagitan ng pagkumpara sa nakalahad rito sa mga SALN ng mga Duterte. Ang ibig sabihin nito ay PINANIWALAAAN NA NINYO ang mga dokumentong ibinigay sa inyo ng hindi ninyo kakilalang si JOSEPH DE MESA na, UULITIN KO PONG MULI, nagmula sa HINDI PINAPANGALANANG kamag-anak na kawani sa isang HINDI PINAPANGALANANG ahensya?Hindi ko po matanggap na may mga ACCOUNTANT na pinayagan ang ganitong pamamaraan. Nakalimutan ko pong sabihin na hindi lang po ako abogado isa rin po akong Certified Public Accountant. Kaya alam ko po na NAPAKAIMPORTANTE sa isang accountant na sa kanyang mga pagsusuri ay sigurado sya sa katotohonan ng mga dokumento at impormasyon na sinusuri nya.KAYA PO AKO NADISMAYA AT NAGALIT nung mabasa ko ang Affidavit ninyo. Lumalabas po ang katotohanang NILOLOKO NINYO ANG SAMBAYANANG PILIPINO!Baka naman sabihin ninyo na dahil eleksyon ngayon ay normal ang NAGLOLOKOHAN. Totoo po ito, kaya nga po sinabi ko na di ako gaanong nagbibigay ng opinyon ukol sa batikosan sa pulitika normal nga ito.Ang HINDI PO NORMAL at HINDI KO PO MATANGGAP ay ang pangyayari na isang NATURINGANG SENADOR NG REPUBLIKA NG PILIPINAS ay nagawang LOKOHIN ANG SAMBAYANAN.SENADOR PO KAYO, napakataas po ng katungkulan ninyo sa pamahalaan at dahil nga po mataas ang katungkulan ninyo ay binibigyan po ng bigat ng mga mamamayan ang mga sinasabi ninyo. Bakit naman ninyo nagawang MAGSAMBULAT NG MGA PARATANG na wala naman talaga kayong TOTOONG BASEHAN?.Di lang po kayo SENADOR, nanggaling po kayo sa Philippine Military Academy. Nasaan na po ang Courage na maging makatotoo, ang Integrity sa inyong katungkulan, ang Loyalty sa mamamayang Pilipino? NASAAN NA PO?Huwag na po natin pag-usapan ang pagiging illegal ng pinangalingan ng mga dokumento na ginagamit ninyo, dun na lang po tayo sa inyong katungkulan bilang Senador at graduate ng PMA.SANA PO AY BINIGYAN NYO NG KAHIHIYAN ANG katungkulan ninyo bilang Senador at pagiging alumnus ng PMA.Sa pagtatapos po ng liham ko na ito gusto ko pong sabihin sa inyo na hindi pa po huli ang lahat puwede pa po kayo HUMINGI NG TAWAD. Hindi po patawad ni Mayor Duterte kung hinde patawad ng SAMBAYANANG PILIPINO.Dito na lang po,CAESAR S. EUROPAPilipino, Davaoeno, AbogadoIN THAT ORDER POCommentscomments",

    "body": "A Filipino couple who spent their honeymoon in one of the world’s biggest cruise ships were hailed heroes, and could possibly get luxury employment after they helped save more than 80 passengers who were struck with severe gastro.On Monday while on-board the Ovation of the Seas, Adrian and Laura Lorenzo, both 29, were alerted by one of the ship’s crew and asked if they are experiencing stomach pains.After telling the crew that they’re both okay, the couple learned that more than 200 passengers are in severe pain due to gastro breakout while the ship is travelling en route to Hobart port in Tasmania.The couple immediately went out of their room and offered help to the ship’s doctors whose hands were already full.Adrian Lorenzo and Laura Escueta were just married last week.Loading…Planning to copy this article? Read this first. The couple,who were both graduated from the University of Sto. Tomas College of Medicine, and just passed the board exam last year, helped more than 80 people to receive first aid and fast relief before the ship could docked in Hobart.More than 200 people were immediately brought to hospital in Tasmania, and since the Southern Australian City is not used to cater such large volume of patients, they were asked if they can help, and they did not say no.The couple spent two days in Tasmanian hospital helping mostly British Citizens.The Royal Caribbean Cruises, the company that owns the Ovation of the Seas, praised the couple for their effort and hospitality and promised to hire both of them if they are interested to join its fleet.The Australian Government also talked to the couple and shows interest in hiring them, saying Australia is badly in need of “young professionals with great skills” like them.The Royal Caribbean Cruises offered a refund for their travel fee as a token of appreciation for what they have done, and another two free cruises in Caribbean and Europe if they wish not to join the company.The couple is planning to open a clinic in BGC upon their return but the plan seems to change after their unlikely cruising experience.The couple was bombarded with words of gratitude from their fellow passengers upon their departure from the hospital on Wednesday. They went back to the ship to complete their 1-month cruising while making another career decision after the incident. /Nikki Maliksi/",

The group has been identified as an affiliate of a weakening Islamic State in the Middle East.Following unconfirmed reports that the bodies of two were retrieved, Lorenzana went on record to say that Hapilon and Omar Maute were killed in a military operation.\"We have received a report from [Armed Forces of the Philippines] ground commanders in Marawi that the operation conducted by government forces to retake the last remaining Daesh-Maute stronghold in the city has resulted in the death of the last terrorist leaders Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute, and that their bodies have been recovered by our operating units,\" Lorenzana said.On May 23, President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao following an armed confrontation between government forces and the Maute group in Marawi City.The siege in Marawi City was triggered by an operation of government forces to neutralize Hapilon.Remaining hostagesIn the operation, the military rescued 17 more hostages who have been held captive by the ISIS-inspired local terror group for more than four months.Military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla, meanwhile, said on Monday that troops are being careful in the intense fighting with militants in Marawi City because of concerns for the safety of the 50 to 100 hostages still being held by the Islamic State group-linked militants.",

The pair of lovers is young, extremely impulsive and emotional.One mother who is working as an OFW (overseas Filipino worker) in Saudi Arabia went to Raffy Tulfo for help after she found out that her teenage daughter eloped.The video of the particular segment was uploaded to the official Facebook page of “Raffy Tulfo in Action,” where it has reached one million views and about 3,800 comments from the netizens. Based on their description, the mother approached the well-known broadcaster to retrieve her daughter.According to Shela Migue Te, she does not know the reason why her daughter would do that. “Nasa Saudi po kasi ako, kaya po ‘ko napilitan umuwi dahil sa anak ko po! Dapat nga po August pa po ‘yung uwi ko kasi nga po nag-iipon ako para sa kanila, biglaan po ‘yung uwi ko, kahit wala akong ipon, umuwi na po ako.”She said that she immediately went back to the Philippines after finding out her daughter went with her boyfriend. At that point of the program, Raffy Tulfo called the teenager on the phone. He told her that her mother was on the program to retrieve her.Then he prompted Mrs. Migue Te to talk to her daughter. She tearfully stated, “(Name of daughter), gabi-gabi umiiyak ako, miss na miss na kita, dalawang tao din ako nasasabik sa’yo, bumalik (ka) na, anak ko!”The daughter replied but the broadcaster butted in and asked her why she would elope with her boyfriend. She answered, “Kasi po ‘yung kapatid ko, sabi sa’kin, ‘Te ‘pag lumayas ka na dito, magiging masaya na ‘ko!'”Raffy Tulfo gestured to her brother, who was with Mrs. Migue Te. He asked for his side of the story, to which the young man replied, “Isang beses ko lang po sinabi ‘yun, kasi lagi po siyang hindi na umuuwi. Lagi po siyang gabi, madaling araw, lagi naman po kaming naghihintay, nag-aalala. Tapos wala po siyang reason.”How did Tulfo solve the problem among the family?

Some began vomiting.CCDRRMO dispatched six ambulances to the school to transport the students to the hospital but the poisonous substance was strong to be overturned by their system, the doctor noted.Kenneth Siasar, hospital administrator of CCMC, said some of the students vomited at least five times before they died.Bañacia and the City Health Department went immediately to the school after the incident was reported to the command center and collected samples of the free drink that had been distributed to the students.SOURCE: http://dw-tv3.com",

But by supporting calls for Mocha to resign or wishing for her to be imprisoned is actually sending the wrong message. This is not an attack on Mocha. This is an attack on social media by Trillanes who wants to silence free expression. Guys, dito na lang tayo nakakabawi. Kontrolado nila ang mainstream media. Nakita niyo ba na nababalita ang any positive representation ng mga DDS. Wala po. Social media is able to neutralize the discussion. Nakakita ba kayo ng host ng any news program na openly pro-Duterte? May kakaunti but their content is controlled. Mainstream media is unfair to the DDS. Trillanes is trying to silence pro-Duterte bloggers starting with Mocha while attacking anyone connected with Duterte using his immunity as shield. If he is successful in removing Mocha from the present status quo with your help because you happen not to like her, then do not blame us if there will come a time that even your blogs will be regulated and censored by bullies like Trillanes.Hindi perfect si Mocha. Hindi naman niya sinasabing perfect siya. Alam niyo na wala ako sa inner circle of bloggers na malapit kay Mocha. Pero tayong lahat na nasa social media ang pinaglalaban namin lalo na si Mocha. Fake news man o hindi, hindi yun sapat para ipako siya sa cruz kasi walang tayong obligasyon maging exact and impartial sa mga posts natin. Blogs lang ito. Personal opinions na mali o hindi, peke o totoo. Ang mainstream media ang dapat may ganung obligasyon. At kung natutupad yun ng mainstream media, dun na sana kayo maging mapanghugsa sa mga bloggers tulad ni Mocha. Entertainer lang siya. Bakla lang ako. Pero lahat tayo Pilipino. May sariling opinyon. Hindi news ito. Opinyon ang blog hindi news. So, kung hahayaan ninyo na magtagumpay si Trillanes na patahimikin si Mocha dahil kakasuhan at ihaharass, ipasara niyo na lang din ang social media. Kasi tayo na ang isusunod na patatahimikin.This statement got different reactions from the netizens and some of the top comments are :What are your thoughts on this? Do we really have to focus on Mocha Uson and how she is using social media on her advocacies rather than looking how the mainstream media is manipulating information and news?source Public TrendingOn September 22, 2017, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV warned the public regarding the cases filed against Mocha Uson because of allegedly spreading fake news.Uson has a number of followers and is known in using social media to express support to the President’s administration. Not only does her fame take her at top, but she was given a position in the government, too. Her loyalty towards the Duterte administration got different reactions from the people. Some questioned her capacity in serving in the government, some stated she can use her popularity to influence the people, hopefully in a good way.But just recently, Uson has been facing allegations and is now being questioned as far as the information she is releasing on her blog.While this is another topic in the Senate, Atty. Bruce Rivera posted his thoughts on Trillanes’ actions against Uson.",

    "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte returned from a “productive” visit to Brunei on Saturday that underscored the two countries’ friendship, Malacañang said.Duterte on Thursday evening left for an overnight visit to Brunei to attend the 50th anniversary of accession to the throne of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.In a statement, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Duterte thanked Bolkiah for his “principled” commitment to the “pursuit of just and lasting peace and development” in Mindanao, Duterte’s home region.To recall, the Sultanate had recently promised to help in developing Mindanao, which is one of the focus areas of the ASEAN sub-regional grouping of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.“The President looks forward to further broaden and deepen bilateral cooperation with Brunei Darussalam, as well as to advancing efforts toward a more peaceful, prosperous and progressive ASEAN,” Abella said.“The celebrations were a fitting tribute to a beloved leader who made amity and cooperation a cornerstone of secure and stable relations between nations in Southeast Asia and beyond,” he added.On Tuesday, Duterte said he had accepted Bolkiah’s invitation because the sultan is his “good friend” and a “dear friend of the Philippines.”The 71-year-old Bolkiah is one of the world’s longest reigning absolute monarchs and one of the richest individuals in the world.In 2008, the sultan posted a net worth of $20 billion, a wealth based on Brunei’s oil and gas reserves, according to Forbes magazine.Duterte first visited Brunei in October last year.Brunei was supposed to be the first country to be visited by Duterte as president but he was forced to cancel his trip in September 2016 because of the Davao blast.Amid mounting criticisms at home and abroad for his bloody drug war, Duterte might have found an ally in Bolkiah, who vowed to help eradicate drug trafficking during his Manila trip last April.The April visit of Bolkiah, a leader known for pushing tough Shariah penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery, is the first state visit under the Duterte administration.Philippine exports to Brunei amounted to $85 million in 2014, data from the embassy show.Watch Video Here below:",

    "body": "Each November for the past 10 years, the province of Tarlac ushers in what is called “the longest Christmas in the world” — Pinoy Christmas, that is, with its own brand of grand spectacle called Belenismo sa Tarlac. Belenismo, or the art of making a belen, is a province-wide community undertaking of Tarlaqueños that has earned the province the title “Belen-making capital of the Philippines.”Traditions of old bayanihan or communal unity, Pinoy creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness, and the Filipinos’ innate love for all things celebratory, is evident in the assemblage of masterfully crafted crèches both large and small, depicting the Nativity scene — the heart of Christmas.For 10 years, the indefatigable mother-and-daughter tandem of Isabel Cojuangco Suntay and Dr. Isa Cojuangco Suntay, founders of the Tarlac Heritage Foundation, Inc., have been tirelessly bringing together individuals, barangays, municipalities, schools, organizations and business establishments in orchestrating Tarlac’s greatest attraction during this holiday season of merriment — transcending economic class, political and religious choices.This year is extra special in that the Belenismo sa Tarlac is not only celebrating a decade of honoring the birth of the child Jesus through its famed crèches. This year, the Belenismo sa Tarlac pays tribute to our bothers and sisters in Marawi, and the heroes who fought for their freedom. Taking center stage in this tribute is the Belen of the Hall of Fame awardees — the Philippine Army 7th Infantry Division, Mechanized Infantry Division, and Philippine National Police Regional Office 3.Entitled “Marawi sa Panahon ng Kapayapaan,” this belen stands proudly on the grounds of the Northern Luzon Command in Camp Aquino in Tarlac City. Handmade by soldiers and policemen (many of whom served and fought in Marawi), the belen is made of recycled materials and is set against a backdrop of the ruins of the five-month war in Mindanao. It was designed by one of the Belenismo’s longtime advocates, Ding Mercado.At the final judging last Nov. 18, our valiant heroes headed by Philippine Army Lt. Gen. Rolando Joselito Bautista were there in full force to dedicate their obra maestra to their fallen comrades in the recent war in Mindanao. Sgt. Ronnie Halasan of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division also gave an emotional performance of his original composition Bangon Marawi. Halasan said he wrote the song during the first week of battle in Marawi, when he was assigned to bring supplies to government forces fighting terrorists inside the city. Asked for the overall message of his song, he said: “Kailangan talaga magtulungan. Magtulungan ang bawat isa upang bumangon ulit ang Marawi.”Lifestyle Feature – Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1And what has become a tradition for the past 10 years, Belenismo sa Tarlac 2017 officially marked this year’s start of Christmas for the judges composed of Ding Mercado, Boysie Villavicencio, Johnny Co, Reina Tan, Gigi Sanares, Carlo Rojas, Mike Mina, my sisters Michelle Dayrit-Soliven and Yvonne Dayrit-Romualdez, myself, and members of various media networks, as we visited the 21 belens that made the cut to the finals.Holland and beyondThe entry of Capas stood out as a winner with imposing replicas of the windmills of Holland using recycled scrap G.I. pipes and iron sourced locally from the junk shops of Capas. Creatively and delicately infused in this masterpiece is — believe it or not —carabao manure. Collected from nearby Crow Valley Gunnery Range in Barangay Sta. Juliana along the trek to Mt. Pinatubo, where the dried carabao manure was collected and carefully transformed into glittering colorful floral-like works of art that decorate the belen, leaving the judges in awe of the humility that went into the creation of this entry.“Born to Save” is a grand and theatrical interpretation of the crèche by the municipality of Moncada. Steampunk-inspired, it incorporates technology and aesthetics drawn from 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. It features vintage fashion elements using native and modern materials with a millennial twist provided by the brightly lit giant marquee reading “Born to Save.”Fish be with youThis playful but meaningful creation symbolizes the source of livelihood of Concepcion, Tarlac — fish culture. Their entry depicts the Nativity scene where the Holy Family is enveloped in a giant fish that is made out of indigenous materials such as bamboo, bulo, woven straw mats, abaniko, bilao, burlap sack, and abaca, festooned with festive lighting making it look like it’s shimmering in the rays of the golden sun. The giant fish belen is surrounded with depictions of Filipino traditions and representations of the other livelihood sources of Concepcion.In San Manuel municipality, the country’s Outstanding Yellow Corn producer and a rising agricultural town in the province, the winning belen is made out of recycled styrofoam packs, plastic bottles and indigenous materials such as bamboo meticulously assembled into a dramatic and magnificent half circle backdrop of yellow corncobs.In San Clemente, staging a belen with the theme “Environmental Protection and Preservation” has become a tradition. This year’s entry speaks about protecting our oceans and seas from climate change, pollution and decades of overfishing threats — thereby presenting a colorful, life-sized “under the sea” backdrop for the Nativity scene made out of indigenous materials, recycled plastic materials and other recyclable resources from the previous belen entries.I’m a fan!In preparation for the coming 500th anniversary, in 2021, of the arrival of Christianity in the country, Saint Francis of Assisi Parish belen in San Manuel pays homage to a tradition that has been at the heart of Filipino Christmas for centuries — the Simbang Gabi, as represented in the white nine-panel giant fan backdrop of the Nativity scene. It is also an acknowledgement of our gratitude to Spain for the faith that we now have.The tribute to Marawi is also echoed in the winning belen of McDonald’s Capas. It features stylized and colorful Moro vintas, umbrellas, brass gongs, and the Holy Family in traditional Muslim-inspired clothing, all handmade from indigenous materials by the crew.At the St. Joseph Parish Church in Barangay O’Donnel, Capas, Tarlac, its parishioners headed by Fr. Noel Paguinto adopted the “Taon ng Parokya” or Year of the Parish (declared by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines) as the theme of their winning belen. The crèche, mounted in a lampshape frame, sits on a sturdy star-shape structure made out of bricks.In the Community Category of the Belenismo sa Tarlac, Sto. Cristo Parish utilized a caromata, a transportation mode from the old Philippines, for their belen that bagged the top prize in that category. The caromata then was used to ferry not only people but goods as well. This Christmas, the decorated caromata is envisioned to ferry God-made-man Jesus to the hearts of people so that in his humanity we will experience his divinity. The backdrop of the caromata is inspired by the colorful Masskara Festival of Bacolod, because it seems Jesus in becoming man masked himself with our humanity.Sharing the top spot with Sto. Cristo Parish is a simple creation of the SVDF Choir of Barangay Balingcanaway, Tarlac City. Called “Belen sa Bulaklak,” it features the Nativity scene with the Holy Family on a colorful floral-shaped structure — actually the shape of the map of Tarlac province upon closer inspection, made out of recycled and recyclable materials.Another notable winner in the Community Category that caught the judges’ eyes is this year’s refreshing entry by BHF Ligtasan — a simple Nativity scene on a meticulously landscaped deck with fresh flora. Faux giant taro leaves were infused in the setting to highlight the Baby Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. A modern twist and treatment was given to the gifts of the Three Kings — appliances placed around the scene, connecting it to the business of BHF.Belenismo sa Tarlac, indeed, is season of giving and sharing, of making others happy. It is a respite from the drudgery of life — steering the weary towards peace and goodwill. Merry Christmas!* * *Belenismo sa Tarlac runs until January 2018. Email me at miladay.star@gmail.com.",

May said Trump’s decision was wrong and Trump responded by asking her to take care of her nation. British parliament members have urged May not to invite Trump for a state visit next year.Speaking of May’s invitation, Sanders said it has been “extended and accepted,” adding that the White House is working with the British side “to finalize the details, which we expect to announce soon.”Asked why Trump did not use harsh rhetoric against Russia in his speech on the national security strategy on Monday, Sanders said Trump and the White House have always been “tough” on Russia.“The president has weighed in on Russia and his feelings on that a number of times. The policy and the strategy put forth in that very detailed paper was that of the president and it reflects his views,” she said.She added that Trump “has been clear what his position is. We’ve been tough on Russia, we’ve put sanctions on Russia, we’ve imported energy, and impacted them in a big way. The president has not been soft in this process.”In the national security strategy and the speech, the Trump administration labeled Moscow as the United States’ “competitor” and “rival power” seeking to undermine the Washington-led international order and US interests. Russia has denied such an allegation repeatedly. PNA/Xinhua",

The deputy has been working at the BIR for more than three decades.Henares herself said she was hurt by Duterte’s allegation.“I am hurting for my subordinates because I worked with them for six years and now their hard work is not being recognized,” Henares said.Duterte in one of his midnight briefings in Davao City indicated his desire to abolish the “most corrupt agencies” in government which he said are the Bureau of Customs, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the BIR.“He is the President, he can do whatever he wants, that’s up to him,” Henares said on Duterte’s threat. Guillermo also questioned the motive of Duterte when he said that he wants the bureau and two other government agencies abolished so that rampant corruption in government will be lessened.She added that it is hard to give advice, especially since she does not know what would be the priorities of Dulay in the agency that he will handle.The outgoing BIR chief earlier said that it is up to Dulay whether he would continue or reform the plans and programs of the BIR.Commentscomments",

Trixie Cruz-Angeles on her Facebook post on her page Luminous, she wrote ‘because I believe in him, I will point out to him when he makes mistakes. It is something he told us in Malacanang’ adding that ‘He says he is not perfect and he is more than willing to listen and correct his mistakes’.Setting her bias aside, the lawyer said she will not turn him into an ‘infallible god’ just because she is ‘on his side’.Believing Duterte is still the people’s president, she wrote ‘he is the first, and perhaps the only president to ever really and truly challenge an oppressive status quo. And to listen! To listen to those of us who have been victims of injustice, crime and denial of equal chances.’Citing oppositions whose goal end in pure opposing of the government instead of helping it fulfill its rightful duty to the public they have sworn to serve, Atty. Cruz-Angeles added ‘Yet I will not join the ones who call him out because they want to hold up his mistakes as signs of failure. They don't want him to succeed. Hell, they're willing to burn the country just to prove themselves right’.The staunch supporter of the president concluded with ‘So I repeat, I like this President. I stand by him. Which is another way of saying, Duterte pa rin.’In a separate post, the lawyer opposed the idea that the killing is a 'mere distraction to Andy Bautista'.Source: Luminous by Trixie Cruz-Angeles",

Request daw kasi ni Bishop. They needed to heed the call as they are under the church spearheading the said event.Ang problema, their followers were not keen to joining the said event as many of them actually like the President. Thus, to encourage their members, they promised to give away raffle tickets during the event.Grand Prize: 300,000 Pesosesss!Ui, di biro ang halagang yan sa mga members nila ha!See, this religious group can easily gather a million or more members without the need for incentives or raffle tickets for a cause they believe in.

He said that the Parojinog did not shoot first as they do not even have guns to shoot with.He also recounts that at least 2 grenades were thrown at them after policemen rounded them up the living room. He thought at first that the police were going to serve the warrant but it was grenades they threw on them.The mayor's wife, Susan; mayor Aldong Parojinog; board member Octavio Parojinog and him survived the twin blasts but was eventually killed by gunshot wounds. According to Cesar, Susan was shot when she begged help from the policemen. The board member soon followed then the mayor.Cesar said he survived the bloody raid by smearing blood on his face and body and playing dead. He waited for the sun to come up before going out and shouted for help when a policeman saw him. He said that he thought the policeman who saw him outside was going to shoot him so he screamed for help and also shouted \"media\".Watch the interview below:",

    "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte is being attacked at all sides with allegations about extrajudicial killings, abusive anti-drug war, and brushoff with international figures, but amidst all the controversy where anything has yet to be proven, an anonymous lawyer and former prosecutor urges the Filipinos to protect the President.Social media personality Atty. Bruce Rivera posted on Facebook the open letter of the anonymous lawyer saying that as the media, international entities, and Yellows try to bring down the President, Filipinos should become Duterte’s “wind beneath his wings”.In the first place, it was the Filipinos who asked Duterte a favor to fix the ailing nation, thus, as he continues to execute the task, the support must remain solid in the face of adversaries like “powerful traditional politicians (trapos)”, “ business elites”, “ignorant international entities”, “ and all too mighty disgraced media.”The anonymous lawyer cited media as the first enemy that has converted its watchdog role into “hound dogs and werewolves”. Instead of safeguarding public interest, it continues to destabilize the Philippines by highlighting the negativities about Duterte whether it is credible information or not.ABS CBN, GMA, Rappler, and international media may claim to be practicing their mandate as the Fourth Estate, but the lawyer said that nowhere in the world is that mandate “institutionally enshrined”.International figures such as the UsS, United Nations, European Union, and other foreign communities have done their part in contributing to the attack on Duterte’s presidency.They take in the twisted figures reported by local media and use it as basis to structure arguments, accusations, and resolutions against the President.In the anonymous lawyer’s full post on Rivera’s Facebook, it said,\"Dear Filipinos,This writer is just an ordinary citizen of the Philippines. One among the more than 100 million people being governed by President Rodrigo Duterte and I know my voice is negligible but I decided to make a stand hoping that the rest of the greater majority of the Filipino who believes in Duterte would provide the wind in his sails amidst the barrage of attacks against him from all fronts.WE ASKED HIM THIS FAVORAre we really that oblivious of the fact that we pleaded for President Duterte to run for office? A song prior to the election even assured him that should his feet be weary and tired from running, that we shall be the wind beneath his wings. This is the opportune moment for us to make good such assurance to the good President. Now more than ever, he needs the resolute voice, protection and support of the vast majority of Filipinos as he engages the very few yet powerful traditional politicians ( trapos ), the business elites who are devoid of patriotic hearts, the ignorant international entities and of course the all too mighty disgraced media. If we as a nation fail to rally behind this once in a lifetime President, then we are deserving of a decayed nation and we lose every right to complain about our plight.THE MEDIAWhere do you source your abundant malevolence? How do you replenish your zest for ignorance and want of conscience? Can all of you still look at the mirror and see a reflection of a decent soul?All of you keep harping on Extra Judicial Killing as if it is like a daily routine , similar to brushing your teeth that thrice a day you have to relegate this into the spot light. You hide under the cloak of being SELF PROCLAIMED WATCH DOGS, but do you really know that nowhere in Journalism Principles in the world does that concept exist nor has it ever been institutionally enshrined? In the words of President Duterte, “ Where the Hell” did you ever get that thought? My answer? Precisely from HELL!Even assuming for the sake of argument that you are watch dogs as you proclaim to be, then you have the obligation to watch and be balanced and responsible. Such is not the case with you ABS CBN, GMA 7, Rappler and International Media. You are acting more like hound dogs and werewolves. In many occasions you acted worst than vultures.Where has the dignity and prudence of Journalism gone? You are not Journalists . You can all be beaten by decent University Students in how they think and handle themselves and yet you wallow in the delusion that you are all professionals. Really now? Professionals ? Questions about gums? Questions about why the President went to China ? Questions about why the President is threatening criminals ? Questions about why the President is putting his foot down on America? Do you really not comprehend or you just refuse to comprehend? Or you are really devoid of the mental capacity to understand a simple issue? If it is the latter, then you don’t have any business reporting because you are belching and feeding people polluted information.You focus on trivial matters and matters which you believe can sell your stories You magnify things and demonize the President because it is in accord with the wishes of your Masters and it will sell your convoluted stories.You ought to be ashamed of even breathing as you have abandoned your responsibility to give an objective news reporting. Yes, you can report bad news but look at your percentage over good news. If you can claim they are balanced, then the more than 95% of Filipinos who support the President, including this writer should be condemned and executed. Your reckless abandon in typing your articles which we call trash have painted our country in bad light all over the world. You can and should claim authorship of that. When this country goes to the drain, I hope you can all sleep well dear media moguls and your paid assassins. Free Speech is not a license and you do not own a franchise of what you think is right for our country.THE USA, UN , EU and the Rest of the International Watch DogWe do not meddle in your affairs and we expect the same courtesy. It is however revolting to realize that you are so sanctimonious in stamping your unsolicited authority over us as if we are really a nation undeserving of respect. You blindly swallow the reports of media as hook line and sinker and marches on the offensive against our President. Has your success in bedeviling Marcos in the past inspired you to try it again? Are we really like a nation of mendicants that you choke for fun? Stop managing our nation and leave us in standing up with dignity no matter how hard and how tedious it would be.Follow this simple principle: Only those with clean hands can have moral authority to dictate upon others. Question: DO YOU HAVE CLEAN HANDS ?If you answer in the affirmative, then you are indeed one bunch of self righteous idiots!To the YellowtardsYou have raped the nation for so long and you have seriously believed that you can continuously fool and brainwash a nation. Reality will hit all of you hard when you realize that your antics will no longer slave the people. We had enough of you. You have managed to drive the Philippines to the depths of hell after you orchestrated the downfall of Marcos and now you are at it again with President Duterte.Divine justice has a great way of finding you back and lashing at you hard. The people will not allow any of you anymore to do the same tricks your false heroes like Cory and Ninoy did to Marcos. President Duterte is the Philippine President , he is our President and he and not you will define our destiny. So to the Aquinos and your hound dogs ( Trillianes, De Lima, Hontiveros , Drillon , Lagman, Pangilinan and the usurper of the VP position, Robredo ) , we suggest you enjoy your last days in glory because your political stock will go down the drain in front of your very eyes because WE ARE NOW NOT ONLY AN AWAKENED NATION, but we are a DETERMINED PROTECTOR OF CHANGETo the People of the PhilippinesPresident Duterte has been non-stop. One need not be a doctor to see the exhaustion in his eyes. He has a nation to heal and discipline and yet he is bombarded everyday by these people who care less about the repercussions of their acts. May we shield him and provide him inspiration that is because the seat he reluctantly occupies is a very lonely and thankless one.We complain as a nation why we have fallen behind other Asian Countries but at the same time we fail to acknowledge that these countries we envy metamorphosed owing to discipline and strong governance. We were ahead of Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in the years of old and now all we see are the smoke from the tailpipe of their progress. Do we still honestly believe that Vietnam is still behind us? If we do, then we are really a one big hallucinating nation because Vietnam had already made strides that overtook us by leaps and bounds. Should Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos catch up on us, then we really are a nation of loud mouths with no future. These people harping on Human rights and freedom have a tailored self serving definition of which and they are the same people who have for years supported the yellow bloods and look where it has brought us ? To the dumps.If we cannot rally behind the President, if we cannot realize how special this man is to the Philippines and if we fail to acknowledge why the Lord moved his hands to place him in power, then let us be human enough to let President Duterte go back to his private life because it is unfair for him to be assassinated or for him to lose his health just because he wanted a better nation for us. Let us not be selfish. Let the man go and let us all be resigned to the fact that we are a doomed nation and the perpetual doormat of Asia and the world.However, should we believe in the man and the good Lord above and should we really desire a new Philippines, let our little voices be lumped together and be a force to reckon with.I want a better Philippines. We only have one chance at this .I want to be counted in the army of civilians for President Duterte. Do you?\"",

    "body": "Walden Bello, a losing senatorial candidate and a member of the Akbayan partylist that also includes Risa Hontiveros, went on a rant on Facebook attacking the supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte for what he calls “their frothing support for extrajudicial killings and condemnation of fundamental human rights.”Bello’s scathing condemnation of about 16 million Filipinos stems from their approval of Duterte’s anti-crime crusade and the hardline methods it employs against suspected drug pushers and bigtime drug lords. Which he characterizes alternately as taking a “leave of their senses,” a “mass hallucination,” and similar to “being under the influence of drugs.”In his tirade, Bello never once acknowledged that the people’s acceptance of the extraordinary means currently being employed to solve the drug problem has, at its roots, the extraordinary neglect of the past administration. By refusing to even consider the possibility that there is some justification for this all anger, Bello shows himself to be the narrow-minded, self-righteous blowhard that he is.I certainly agree with my friend Jonas Bagas that Duterte fanatics have no monopoly on stupidity, and that the Roxas, Poe, and Binay camps have their fair share of stupid folks. Also, that we have to look at sociological rather than genetic factors to explain people’s political behavior. However, it is undeniable that with their frothing support for extrajudicial killings and condemnation of fundamental human rights, Duterte supporters have taken leave of their senses. I think their lapse into mass hallucination is akin to being under the influence of drugs, something that sociologists like Gustav Lebon characterized as crowd contamination. But unlike the president, who does not believe you can rehabilitate drug addicts, we believe we can rehabilitate political addicts like the Duterte fanatics from their social addiction and welcome them back to civilized society. It’s just a question of providing tender, loving care. But as with the drug user, the first step is always the hardest, that is, yung pagkumbinse sa kanila na sila’y may sakit. – Walden BelloBello’s pretensions of being pro-poor is belied by his condescending attitude towards those, driven by their hopelessness and despair, have taken a path that they otherwise might not have had they received the “tender, loving care” that he mentions from the Aquino administration.No, Mr. Bello, we do not support Duterte because we are under the illusion that he has some magic wand that can whisk all our problems away. Nor are we under the influence of some spell that makes us blind to the dangers of that lie ahead. But after decades of empty promises, ineffective governance, and pseudo-leaders like you, we are more than willing to bite the bullet. Going for Duterte isn’t insanity, sticking to the same failed plan again and again is. And as far as being sick, yes we are – we are sick and tired of you and your kind.On a side note, netizens who reacted negatively to Bello’s post earned a mocking reply from the author to “please keep the shit coming.”source: mindanationCommentscomments",

They’re flying over and they’re offering, they’re proposing to stream the entire event, the entire inaugural,” he told broadcast journalist Karen Davila over ANC’s “Headstart” on Friday (June 17).Duterte will take his oath in simple rites at the Rizal Hall in Malacañang.Andanar, a former news anchor, noted that streaming Duterte’s inauguration on Facebook is just one of the modern ways the incoming administration is trying to communicate with the President-elect’s fanbase, most of whom actively campaigned for him on social media.The online streaming of the President-elect’s oath-taking will likely not be the last of Facebook’s collaboration with the incoming administration as Andanar said he will propose the use of the social networking site for broadcasting Duterte’s public briefings and other government announcements.source: politics.com.phCommentscomments",

Department of Environment and Natural Resources granted license to HMC to mine nickel in the stated island, but ordered it to stop operations in 2011 due to some environmental concerns.In the 2014, Mines and Geosciences Bureau Regional Director Leo Jasareno wrote letter to NAC chairman Zamora, allowing HMC to dispose nickel ore stockpile in Manicani Island “in order to mitigate risks.”According to MGB, the presence of such a stockpile carries risk of polluting surrounding waters, especially when heavy rains that can wash away minerals into the sea.May 2016, after obtaining Mineral Ore Transport Permit from MGB Region 8 Office, HMC resumed the removal of mining waste and loading these into waiting barge for transporting out of the mine site. The said process was expected to be completed this year depending on weather condition.However, Lopez said that an audit of the mine showed that it would be detrimental to the island’s environment if mining waste removal will be continued.“Our audit shows that they are taking too much soil, which goes to China. We are suspending the retrieving of the stockpiles, to address the ecological balance,” Lopez said at sidelines of Financial Executives Institute of Philippines general membership meeting held in Makati City.Instead of shipping ore to China, DENR chief said she would order HMC to use nickel ore for the mine restoration and the conduct of necessary remedial measures in order to prevent nickel ore stockpiles from siltating and polluting water bodies in the Island.excerpt from source: kapinoyCommentscomments",

    "body": "Perhaps the new generation of local-movie lovers is not aware that the first Panday movie was almost aborted by a big storm.That was 37 years ago.“The set in Montalban, Rizal was totally destroyed,” recalled Komiks King Carlo J. Caparas, creator of the legendary hero that has become like second skin to FPJ (Da King). “It was initially directed by Butch Bautista (Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista’s late father). When the set was re-built, FPJ took over as director.”And thus began FPJ’s glorious journey as Panday. The movie topped the 1981 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), surpassing its record year after year, and enthroning FPJ as the unbeaten King of MMFF, going on not just as star in probably the country’s most bankable franchise but also as director and producer.In the 2017 MMFF, Coco Martin is taking his first step along the FPJ path by starring in the seventh resurrection of Panday and at the same time directing and producing it under his own CCM Productions (with Star Cinema and Viva Films as co-producers), using his real name Rodel Nacianceno as megman just as FPJ did (Ronwaldo Reyes).Through the years, with FPJ and Carlo’s blessing, other actors essayed the Panday role, including Bong Revilla (2010-2011, first in Dugo ng Panday, Carlo’s widely-followed Liwayway magazine serial, then Panday which topped an MMFF), Jinggoy Estrada (Hiwaga ng Panday in which he played a Panday-inspired role), Jericho Rosales (in a Kapamilya fantasy-adventure series), and Richard Gutierrez (in a TV5 series).“FPJ is a tough act to follow,” noted Carlo. “That’s a tall order for Coco who should know that not just one Panday is enough to qualify him as the new FPJ. Hindi kainggit-inggitang puwesto ni Coco from whom much is expected. The challenge is not just holding the sword of Panday but also, more so, carrying the torch of FPJ as a top-rate actor-director-producer…a legend. Milya-milya pa ang dapat tahakin ni Coco.”But, and that’s a Big But, Carlo praised Coco for his foresight.“He’s very promising,” observed Carlo. “He’s on the right track. It’s a wise move to get two big companies as co-producers. Among his contemporaries, nag-iisa siyang may dream to be a big name in the industry in the tradition of FPJ.”Carlo with his late wife Donna Villa who passed away early last January: Inseparable for 29 years until the Grim Reaper rudely interrupted their blissful togetherness. Carlo with his late wife Donna Villa who passed away early last January: Inseparable for 29 years until the Grim Reaper rudely interrupted their blissful togetherness.Before the shoot, Carlo and Viva big boss Vic del Rosario Jr. met with Coco to remind him not to violate the “moral rights” of Panday as champion of the oppressed, hailed for being a larger-than-life Knight in Shining Armor, everybody’s big brother and savior.“And also,” added Carlo, “not to veer away from the conflict between Flavio (the Panday) and his nemesis Lizardo. But we gave Coco a free hand to do his own interpretation.”Among the actors who have played Lizardo were the late Max Alvarado (in FPJ movies), Phillip Salvador (Bong movies), Victor Neri (in the Jericho series) and Christopher de Leon (in the Richard series). Now pitted against Coco’s Panday is Jake Cuenca.Serialized in Pilipino Komiks in the late ‘70s, Ang Panday is the first to be filmed among Carlo’s works whose rights were bought by FPJ, also including Daang Hari, Sa Ngalan Mo, Maestro, Sambahin ang Ngalan and Totoy Bato (filmed twice).“Kaming mga komiks creators,” confessed Carlo, “big dream namin ang magawang pelikula ni FPJ ang nobela namin. It meant that you have arrived, that your talent was being recognized. When I created the Panday character, ang nasaisip ko ay si FPJ. The irony is that it was FPJ’s widow (Susan Roces) who called FPJ’s attention about my novel. FPJ told me that one day, Susan told him, ‘May bagong nobela si Carlo na bagay sa’yo’.”The rest is history that continues to inspire movie fans. In his movie, Coco gathered an all-star powerhouse cast that includes, among others, Susan herself (who co-stars with Coco in his Kapamilya series Probinsyano, also popularized by FPJ), Gloria Romero, and two Bb. Pilipinas titlists, Mariel de Leon (International) and Kylie Verzosa (2016 Miss International).Asked about his advice to Coco, Carlo compared Coco’s “big steps” to driving a car.“It’s not an easy task,” reiterated Carlo. “Kumbaga sa sasakyan, nasa first gear pa lang siya. Everything starts on the first gear. As soon as he gets to the second gear, he needs four things…talent, endurance, character and attitude…na kelangan as he accelerates to the third gear and fourth gear. I have seen the movie and in some scenes Coco reminds me of FPJ.”Incidentally, since last January, Carlo has been staying in Cebu where the ashes of his wife Donna Villa were interred beside the graves of Donna’s parents. Actually, the ashes were divided between Carlo and children CJ and Peach. It seems that up to now, Carlo hasn’t learned how to let go, how to move on, which is understandable because he and Donna were inseparable for 29 years until the Grim Reaper rudely interrupted their blissful togetherness.Carlo can’t talk about Donna without choking with emotion, so Funfare refrained from asking further about the subject after wishing him and his children a Merry Christmas.(E-mail reactions at entphilstar@yahoo.com.

Sa kanyang sermon binigyaang diin ni Archbishop David na hindi nag-iisa ang mga naulilang ina at ama ni Kian na sina Zaldy at Lorenza Delos Santos dahil marami ring mga kabataan ang dinukot at pinatay sa ibat ibang lugar sa CAMANAVA Area na naka-bonet na mga suspek. Giit ni Archbishop David magsilbing aral sana sa gobyerno ang mga nangyayaring patayan sa bansa na dapat tigilan na at huling biktima nasa si Kian dahil wala itong magandang maidudulot upang mapaganda ang kinabukasan ng bansa. Ipinunto ni Bishop David ang nakatala sa bibliya ang John 3:16 kung saan ganun nalamang ang pagmamahal ng ama sa sanlibutan kaya ibinigay niya ang kanyang bugtong na anak upang iligtas ang sanlibutan. Dagdag pa ni Bishop David lumuha ang langit at nakiisa sa paghahatid sa huling hantungan kay Kian Delos Santos dahil pinatay umano ang grade 11 student ng walang kalaban laban. Hinamon din ni David ang mga nabiktima ng EJK na lumutang din at ilahad sa publiko huwag matakot upang malaman ang buong katotohanan.Share this Video!Visit and follow our Facebook Fan Page: Duterte Administration - 2016 to Present | Tulfo Brothers News© To The Owner of This Video Source: Source: RMNDISCLAIMER: (NO COPYRIGHT INTENTIONS, FOR SUPPORT AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY) I do not own ANY of the soundtrack, property and rights for audio/ video or Image go to the OWNER.

    "body": "Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas held his last mass this Sunday, November 26 in his hometown, as the president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In his homily, the outgoing CBCP president urged the Filipino Catholics to be watchful of the actions of President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration.“Kapag dumarating ang tukso, huwag nating kalimutan ang mayroon tayong Diyos na mapagpatawad. Ganunpaman, maging mapagmasid din tayo sa mga kilos ng ating pamahalaan. Huwag tayong matakot na punahin kung may makita tayong pang-aabuso. At higit sa lahat, wag nating hayaang bumalik ang diktadorya.” Archbishop Villegas said.(When temptation comes, let us not forget that he have a forgiving God. Nevertheless, we should be watchful of our government. Do not be afraid to condemn them if you see they are doing wrong. But most importantly, let us not allow being under dictatorship again.)Villegas, who will be replaced by Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles as the new CBCP president this coming Friday, December 1, also thanked the Catholics for supporting his leadership in CBCP. He has been holding the post since 2013, replacing Oscar Cruz, and is known for his stances on political issues and being critical against President Duterte.Must Read: * Incoming CBCP President Romulo Valles Urges Media to Report the Truth, Not Be Bias vs DuterteTwo days before the 31st anniversary of the 1986 EDSA People Power last February, Villegas wrote a letter to the late Jaime Cardinal Sin, saying that the country is experiencing nightmares under the Duterte administration. As a response, President Duterte’s daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte called him as worse than a hundred of her father.”On the other hand, Archbishop Valles is known to be a friend of the presidential family particularly during the time when President Duterte was still the mayor of Davao City. In fact, he led the opening prayer at Duterte’s inauguration on June 30, 2016, and baptized the president’s newest grandson, Stonefish Duterte Carpio in Davao City last March.Contributed by Salvi Dalida",

    "body": "Senate Public Information Committee chair Senator Grace Poe said she would’ve wished to conclude the hearings right then and there, but she instead decided to suspend it because Cocoy Dayao has to be found and interrogated first. After all, Cocoy Dayao’s the central figure in this issue and no one else.Because of his non-appearance despite the senate’s invitation, the Senate has subpoenaed Cocoy Dayao to force him to appear in the next hearing.Three days after that fateful Wednesday hearing, I asked my senate sources if there’s any progress towards finding Cocoy, and they told me that they haven’t found a trace. Flight is a sign of guilt, but whatever.Cocoy is missing, and that’s a problem.Suffice it to say, Dayao is key to solving the mystery, and that key is MISSING. If Dayao somehow pops up from nowhere in the near future, then all’s well. But if he doesn’t, then the quest of the seven senators for who’s behind the “ Seven Deadly Sens ” campaign will grind to a halt.Now, the problem with the first #CocoyGate article is that Sass, VovPH, and I found only ONE person connected with SilentNoMore, and that is Cocoy Dayao.A succeeding article, “#CocoyGate: Senator Villar, let me link Cocoy to Bam and Kiko”, cites another name – Niña Terol-Zialcita – as another potential suspect, but aside from Terol-Zialcita’s involved in ProPinoy as its Deputy editor-in-chief and co-founder, there is no evidence showing that she has any significant web development skills, so for now, I’m willing to set her aside.In short, if Dayao remains missing, then we’re at a dead end. And in times like these, what I typically do is sit in a corner, go back to basics, and retrace the steps.So let’s do that.It’s clear, at this point, that the collective wrath of the seven senators is focused on SilentNoMorePH.But is it just SilentNoMore?Pinoy Ako BlogIn “Labanan ang #7DeadlySens!!!”, SilentNoMorePH paired each senator to a specific “deadly sin”, though it wasn’t specific as to which is paired to what. As if taking a cue from SilentNoMorePH, Pinoy Ako Blog expanded SilentNoMorePH’s the #7DeadlySens post by providing more libelous specificity.Published a day after SilentNoMorePH’s post, Pinoy Ako Blog’s “ The Unfortunate Seven ” states:Pinoy Ako Blog then showed a series of infographics that paired each senator with a specific deadly sin:“Ito ang mga senador na ayaw matigil ang pagpatay sa mga menor de edad na Pilipino. Iboboto mo pa ba sila? (These are the senators who do not want a stop to the killing of Filipino minors. Will you still vote for them?)\"Now, why is this important?SNM and PAB“Engagement per post (EPP)” is a social media analytics metric that measures a post’s “interestingness” to an audience. That is, higher EPP scores means a post spreads to more people [ TP:Mainstream vs Indie ].Engagement per Post = Engagement ÷ Number of PostsFacebook Page Insights data taken at 1713 hrs, 08 October 2017Who are the content creators behind SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog?Who are Cocoy’s Content Creators?Silentnomoreph.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users Pinoyakoblog.com/wp-json/wp/v2/usersFor SilentNoMorePH, here’s a video showing how I did it:And for PinoyAkoBlog:User “Admin“, with display name “Charlie“ User “Vic“, with display name “Vic“ User “JD“, with display name “JD“ User “Maria“, with display name “Maria“User “Admin-2“, with display name “admin“ User “Kit“, with display name “Full Retard“ User “Admin“, with display name “Mr. Pinoy“ User “Jover“, with display name “Mr. Pinoy“ User “Apple“, with display name “Mr. Pinoy“Who are these people?IMPORTANT NOTE:Laurio may delete her posts (and even her account) as soon as she finds out about this article, so I archived the pertinent pages using the third-party service Archive.is. That is, every hyperlink with the text “[A]” links to the archived snapshot of the hyperlinked page immediately preceding it.For example, for the sentence “  wrote this article [ A ].”, the page linked to “[A]” is an archived copy of the page linking to “”.Jover Laurio on FacebookPost No. 1: ~3 minutesPost No. 2: ~1 minutePost No. 3: ~2 minutesPost No. 4: ~2 minutesPost No. 5: ~1 minutePost No. 6: ~6 minutesAs we can see, Laurio’s shared PinoyAkoBlog’s posts almost immediately after the latter posted them on Facebook. Now, is Jover just a rabid PinoyAkoBlog fan, or is she one of PinoyAkoBlog’s administrators?At this point, it’s too early to tell. But we are not done yet. Let’s take a look at Jover’s tweets.Jover Laurio’s TweetsTweet No. 1: ~2 minutesTweet No. 2: ~2 minutesTweet No. 3: ~2 minutesTweet No. 4: ~15 minutesTweet No. 5: ~2 minuteSeriously, Laurio's devotion to PinoyAkoBlog is tenacious, to say the least.The Laurio-Dayao Connection“Thanks Coy! I feel so blessed! Ang mahal kaya nito, alam ni God na di ko kayang bumili on my own”Yeah, they follow each other. They know each other well.TP’s TakeawaysWhile SilentNoMorePH is the focus of the #SenateHearing, it has to be pointed out that PinoyAkoBlog did more damage to the seven senators’ respective reputations. SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog share the same web administrator, and that’s Cocoy Dayao. SilentNoMorePH’s and PinoyAkoBlog‘s respective libelous articles about the Senate Resolution 516 scandal share the same talking points. PinoyAkoBlog’s users include a certain person going by the username “Jover”. A little more sleuthing shows that Laurio shares and retweets PinoyAkoBlog’s posts almost immediate after PinoyAkoBlog’s administrators post them on Facebook or tweets them. Laurio knows Dayao, and their exchanges can be traced as far back sa December 2015. Judging by the quality of their exchanges, Laurio and Cocoy seem to be pretty emotionally close. Laurio even gets web development advice from Dayao.How many persons with the first name “Jover” will you ever meet in your life?How many Jovers can Cocoy possibly know personally?NBI Cybercrime, if you can’t find Cocoy, find her.DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:The Senators are fuming at SilentNoMorePH, but they should be angrier at PinoyAkoBlog, for the simple reason that the latter did more damage to their reputation. And don’t forget that both are owned or controlled by the same Cocoy Dayao. That is, it’s likely that those behind PAB are also behind SilentNoMorePH.But how exactly did PAB do more damage?EPP is defined by the following formula:A look at Facebook Page Insights data taken at 1713 hrs, 08 October 2017, shows that while SilentNoMore has higher absolute engagement figures compared to Pinoy Ako Blog, the latter posted only a small fraction of what the former did.From the data in the image and using the EPP formula, EPP for SilentNoMorePH is 1,270 while that for PinoyAkoBlog is 4,911. That is, PinoyAkoBlog’s libelous posts may have done about 3 times more damage to the seven senators’ reputation, compared to SilentNoMorePH’s posts.And just like SilentNoMorePH, Cocoy Dayao owns or controls PinoyAkoBlog.I have a reasonable suspicion that SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog, owing to their similar content and talking points, and common webmasters, and possibly, a common financial beneficiary.Now, recall that I myself said in during the #CocoyGate #SenateHearing that Cocoy, who has web development skills, may be working with a bunch of content creators because of the sheer number of sites that Cocoy controls.So, let’s ask:Of course, the content creators are anonymous, but there’s an easy way to find a few clues.You see, SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog both run on WordPress, which is probably the most popular content management system for websites on earth. And because WordPress is popular, a lot of people know how it works.Now, adding the character string “/wp-json/wp/v2/users” to a WordPress-powered blog’s web address reveals the login IDs of the site’s users. Thus, let’s try checking the following:Let me list down the information I got.For SilentNoMorePH, four users showed up. These are:For PinoyAkoBlog, five users showed up. These are:And here’s where things get interesting.It is common for internet users to use their nickname for their online login ID’s, and I suspect that at least one among those login ID’s I found is a real nickname (or even the real first name) of the corresponding user.Now, the nicknames “Vic”, “Maria”, “JD”, “Charlie”, “Apple”, and “Kit” are too generic, so I admit that my online forensic skills are not enough to find out who they are. However, the last remaining username, “Jover”, is interesting.I think I can do something with it because Jover is a relatively rare first name. A simple google search using the search term “Jover PinoyAkoBlog” [ A ] shows a certain “Jover Laurio” diligently sharing PinoyAkoBlog’s posts on a public Facebook group “ NETIZENS FOR CONSCIENCE AND BRAVERY (NetCAB)”It’s interesting to note that Edwin Lacierda is also a NetCAB member Enough with that. On with the analysis.Now it’s time check her NetCAB posts. Note that each of the following several images contain two screenshots: one when the mouse pointer hovers over Laurio’s post share timestamp, and another with mouse hovering over PinoyAkoBlog’s post timestamp.Share Timestamp: 31 May 2017, 7:05 PMPAB Timestamp: 31 May 2017, 7:02 PMShare Timestamp: 08 June 2017, 8:08 PMPAB Timestamp: 08 June 2017, 8:07 PMShare Timestamp: 10 June 2017, 9:54 PMPAB Timestamp: 10 June 2017, 9:52 PMShare Timestamp: 01 June 2017, 10:46 PMPAB Timestamp: 01 June 2017, 10:44 PMShare Timestamp: 11 June 2017, 07:31 PMPAB Timestamp: 11 June 2017, 07:30 PMShare Timestamp: 05 June 2017, 08:20 PMPAB Timestamp: 05 June 2017, 08:16 PMLet’s tabulate the time differences between PinoyAkoBlog’s posts and Laurio’s shares:Here are some of Jover’s other shares:Jover goes by the twitter handle “MissJover” [ A ].Now, let’s check some of her latest retweets of PinoyAkoBlog’s tweets.Let’s tabulate the time differences between PinoyAkoBlog’s tweets and Laurio’s retweets:Again, as we can see, Laurio retweeted PinoyAkoBlog’s tweets almost immediately after PAB tweets. And again, is Jover just a rabid fan, or is she one of PinoyAkoBlog’s administrators?Looking further into Laurio’s tweets, Sass and I discovered that Laurio has been in contact with Dayao from way back, as evidenced by a 28 December 2015 tweet where Laurio basically “pep talked” Dayao, as shown below [ A ]:Four months later on 04 April 2016 , Laurio “pep talked” Dayao again, as show below [ A ]:Interestingly, on 17 Jun 2016 , or around the time Laurio was sharing PinoyAkoBlog’s posts on Facebook, Laurio even relayed Dayao’s web development advice to blogger Raissa Robles [ A ]. On 26 February 2016 , one of Laurio’s “lawyer-friends” [ A ] gave her a brand new 64 GB Ipad Air. She’s so thankful for it that, in reply to Dayao’s congratulatory tweet, she even said:I think the previous exchanges are sufficient to show that Dayao and Laurio know each other better than simple online acquaintances. Dayao even uses Laurio's content for his facebook posts, as shown in a cached copy of Dayao's Facebook Note entitled \"Warning: The next social media account Team Duterte steals could be yours\", with a backlink to Laurio's Twitter account.Let me sum this whole thing up.First, let’s list down what we have discovered:Now, let me ask this one simple question:More specifically:Oh, before I forget: PinoyAkoBlog previously said Sass is an idiot because PAB's blogger is female.Sounds just about right.The preponderance of evidence suggests that NBI Cybercrime should contact Jover Laurio and ask her more than a few questions. Luckily, she published her entire name online on 28 February 2017 A ].Her complete name is  ].",

But an attempt to show patrionism has gone wrong.An unidentified woman was seen wearing the Philippine flag as a costume on the day of protest.Truly, when one has given too much freedom, they can forget that everything has it's limitation, including democracy.The photo was taken by the Philippine Daily Inquirer during the September 21 rally of the Liberal party, renouncing the Duterte government for alleged human rights violations and other sins against the people.The Facebook page\"Digong\" has alerted the social media about the Philippine that the woman in the photo had just possible violated.The OP wrote a caption that reads:You can petition the govt for its abuses and lapses but that does not mean you can blatantly violate our law especially RA 8491 also known as the AN ACT PRESCRIBING THE CODE OF THE NATIONAL FLAG, ANTHEM, MOTTO, COAT-OF-ARMS AND OTHER HERALDIC ITEMS AND DEVICES OF THE PHILIPPINES.",

Pero ang tibay ng mga to di mo talaga mararamdaman na nakukuhanan kana ng mga gamit mo sa bag partida buntis ka. Karma nalang siguro sayo, soon! Pashare naman guys para kumalat. Pasikatin ang mag kapatid na to. Btw nareport na namen sila sa pulis! :) ingat nalang tayo guys!\"A netizen chased down two female thieves who swiped his phone together with its charger. You're probably wondering how the thieves managed to steal both phone and charger, right? Well, phone snatchers in Manila are that good in swiping things that don't belong to them and the items were inside the victim's backpack.With a sleight of the hand, netizen Von Joshua Nicolas lost his phone to the two female perpetrators while waiting for the bus near a footbridge. Fortunately, he had friends with him who noticed a woman opened his bag but he was unsure how to react because it was a woman. He eventually told Von Joshua of what had just transpired while the women were walking away.They caught up with the culprits at a nearby eatery where Nicolas confronted the two women asking them to give him back his phone and charger and a wallet from one other victim who was also with them.Not easily fazed by the victims demand, the women, who were siblings, repeatedly denied the allegation, but when pressed to empty their pockets, the women walked out. Man, they always do that when they're losing the argument.Anyway, the victims were eager to get back their things so they followed the women and continued pressing the woman to give it up. The women broke into a trot. The men, who were the victims, followed then it was a full speed chased now.One of the perps finally gave up Nicolas' phone. The victim (who's a man by the way) picked it up and started what all normal theft victims would do to the perpetrator:record a video.It can be seen in the video that the victim was chasing the alleged thieves in the middle of heavily trafficked highway. At one point one of the women told him to stop being maarte na because he got his phone back na.But no, it's not over, yet. \"Where's the damn charger, woman?\", said Von Joshua in his mind. \"Give it up or I will repeatedly punch you in the teeth like you are man\", he might have added. But no. Von Joshua chose to do right thing and that was to ask 'why?' and do nothing violent to the women. Besides, one of them is pregnant.The incident was already reported to the police according to the victim's post below:",

There are a number of awful things that can happen to Mr. Sison.Thus, on Tuesday, hours after Atty. Harry Roque, Duterte’s spokesperson announced that NPA is now a terrorist, Sison did not waste time and called a video conference with a number of his confidants at around 8:00PM Philippine time.According to the information sent to Pinoy Observer, present on the video conference were oldies top communist leaders in Luis Jalandoni, Satur Ocampo, and Fidel Agcaoili. The four including Sison discussed about their possible demise following Duterte’s announcement, so they crafted a plan that would save their company if any or all of them suddenly vanish.On the second part of their conference, they invited Teodoro “Teddy” Casiño, Renato Reyes Jr., Carlos Isagani Zarate, Neri Colmenares, and even female activists like Liza Masa, and carol Araullo.Sison then said that the three (Zarate, Reyes, and Casiño) should prepare because they (Sison, Jalandoni, Agcaoili, and Ocampo), are already old and someone younger should take over their position anytime soon.Carlos Isagani Zarate, an incumbent Party List Representative under Bayan Muna, and a lawyer by profession, has been tasked to take over the position of Luis Jalandoni as chief peace negotiator.Teodoro Casiño has been tasked to take over Fidel Agcaoili and Satur Ocampo’s position as leader of Communist party of the Philippines (CPP).Renato Reyes Jr. on the other hand is tasked to take over the reigns of Joma Sison himself as national Democratic Front (NDF) leader and chief consultant should Joma Sison perish.“These people are young and worthy of leadership position. I am happy leaving this world knowing that the group is in good hands”, Sison said that follows a hand of applause from other delegates.Sison is expected to call a press conference in his home in The Netherlands in few days following Duterte’s landmark declaration.source: localhero..org",

Rey Leonardo Guerrero has ordered the beefing up of “focused military operations” against lawless elements as rebels are expected to intensify their attacks in wake of the termination of the peace talks.“My directive to the troops is to intensify our ‘focused military operations’ to destroy the NPA, and to protect our communities against terrorism,” he said.Guerrero added that focused military operations can prevent the rebels from harassing and intimidating communities.Earlier, the AFP chief said the military strongly supports the decision of President Rodrigo Duterte to cancel talks with Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF).Talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF were ordered scrapped by the Chief Executive, in his Proclamation 360 which signed Nov. 23, following the series of atrocities committed by NPA bands against military and civilian targets in various parts of the country.Around 64 soldiers, police officers and militiamen were killed while another 127 wounded in various attacks and ambushes conducted by the NPA on this year alone.Aside from these, rebel attacks also accounted for 70 civilian deaths, including those of a four-month baby girl in Bukidnon last Nov. 9, along with 13 wounded and another 28 missing.

He recently launched a coffee table book featuring his family, closest friends, and those who supported him all throughout his career. In another interview, though, Derek announced that he will be quitting showbiz once he gets hitched. He added that he and his sweetheart Joanne Villablanca already discussed this matter.“Kapag ikakasal ako, ba-back down na ako sa showbiz. Kilala niyo ako, pag may ginawa ako, di ba, sobrang focused ko? Kagaya sa sports ko, sa career ko. So, pag ginawa ko yun, gusto ko naka-focus na ako sa pamilya ko.”He added:“Pag kasal kasi… ako, hindi puwede na pag kasal lang, tapos diretso na balik ng trabaho. Ako, hindi. Mag-focus muna para gawing stable ang marriage, tapos tingnan natin kung ano ang mangyari sa showbiz career ko. Kilala ko sarili ko, e. Pag mangyari yun, gusto ko mag-focus talaga sa pamilya ko.”When asked what he would do if a project is offered to him after getting married, he said that he’ll think this matter through over the holidays as it is not that easy to turn his back on this one thing that he loves.“Maybe I’ll do a movie here and there, but… I’m not sure. I have to really give it a lot of thought over the holiday, to figure out what I’m going to do. Pero mahal na mahal ko ‘tong ginagawa ko, so it’s not really easy to turn my back. Tingnan n’yo naman, ilang beses kong tinatalikuran ang Frisbee, pero pabalik-balik ako. So, you know… yung kasalan, it’s really a big responsibility, commitment. I want to give it all of me, para alam kong hindi lang ano.”In spite of these, Derek shared that his beloved is very supportive of his decisions.“Si Joanne naman is very supportive of whatever it is I want to do. Hindi niya ako pini-pressure. Hindi niya ako pinipigilan if ever ikasal kami na kailangan ko na mag-quit sa showbiz. Wala siyang ganun. Nakita n’yo naman ako, sobrang saya ko ngayon sa buhay ko, di ba? Tinitingnan ko yung sarili ko sa salamin, iba ang hitsura ko, tuwang-tuwa ako.

Captain Sandoval is a member of Philippine Military Academy Class 2005 and Scout Ranger Class 165.His citation says he “distinguished himself in combat as he displayed extraordinary courage, bravery, sterling leadership and professionalism by offering the greatest sacrifice of giving his life to a fellow comrade, thereby keeping with the finest tradition of Filipino soldiery.”He was also awarded Order of Lapu-Lapu, Magalong Medal.“Sa huling araw niya bilang Scout Ranger, ibinuwis niya ang kanyang buhay para isalba ang buhay ng kanyang tao na naghihingalo na sa tama ng bala,” said in a social media post of Scout Ranger Books.“Tinakbo niya ito para saklolohan, pero naunahan siyang tamaan ng bala ng kalaban.

One day we tell China we wanna talk, then we piss them off a day later. This happened on at least four different occasions through the second and third quarters of 2011.Common sense dictates that the Philippines may not be as truthful as we would have hoped. Kapag nakaharap kasi tayo sa China, gusto nating makipagbati. Pero oras na pagtalikod natin, kabaligtaran ang ating ginagawa. Ang gulo-gulo talaga natin noong 2011, ang hirap ispelingin. In diplomatic terms, it appears na kinakabog natin ang North Korea sa level ng unpredictability.Engaging in talks means openness to compromise. If we had zero intentions to compromise, why did we even bother to talk with China to begin with? We should have already gone to war and have the matter settled already. But we didn’t.And, despite the failed talks with China, the Aquino administration even had the balls to provoke the Chinese in July 2011 when various Philippine government agencies started addressing the area as the “West Philippine Sea.” [ AsiaOne",

Pangilinan released a statement casting doubt of the news report of the raid.“Hinatid ang warrant of arrest ng alas dos ng madaling araw. Pinatay ang CCTV (closed-circuit television) bago pasukin ang bahay. Lahat ng 15 pinaghihinalaang mga drug lord at kanilang mga ‘armadong-armadong’ bodyguard ay nasa pinangyrihan ng krimen at pinatay. Walang sugatan na o nasawi sa panig ng PNP. Hindi makakatotohanan. Pwedeng gawin ito kaninuman.”Political analyst and Manila Times Columnist Malou Tiquia took to Facebook lecturing Sen. Pangilinan, who happens to be a lawyer too, the difference between search warrant and warrant of arrest.Read the post below.Ang search warrant at warrant of arrest Sir ay magkaiba. Sa spelling at saysay ay ibang iba. Yung Isa paghahalughug ng bahay, opisina o gusali. Yung isa, inaaresto ang tao o mga tao.Ang search warrant ay ginagamit sa araw. Ngunit kung ang basehang affidavit ay nagsasabing ang sinasaliksik (baril o droga) ay nasa taong pinangalanan o sa lugar na sinabing saliksikin, ang warrant ay kailangang diretsong sabihin na ito ay puedeng ibigay sa ano mang oras. Napakadaling iikot ang mga baril at droga mula sa iba’t ibang lugar.Mahigit dalawang oras ang pakikipaglaban ng pamilyang Parojinog laban sa team ni CInsp Espenido.Ano ba ang oath of office ng isang mayor at bise mayor? May kataga bang resisting arrest o obstruction of justice?Fr. Eliseo Mercado concurred with Malou and writes: “Tama po..! Search warrant must SPECIFY what is to be searched and where the search is to be done.. Warrant of Arrest is the court order for person/s SPECIFIED – name and surname in the Warrant… and for what alleged crime after probable cause has been established by the fiscal and the judge issuing the warrant has personally verified that the request for warrant of arrest is proper and in order…”Meanwhile, netizen Michelle Clarke thought Pangilinan’s statement absurd. “To think nakaupo sya bilang senator for how many years. Tapos eto maririnig ng karaniwang mamayan sa kanila. Ang mga karaniwang mamayang kagaya ko looks up to our government official na maeducate din kami kahit sa mga simpleng bagay LNG na kagaya ng kaibahan ng search warrant at warrant of arrest.

    "body": "The parasite’s life cycleNormally if a mouse sees a cat, it scuttles away in the other direction, but that’s not what happens after mice get infected with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. Once inside the mouse’s body, the parasite hijacks the mouse’s immune system, to move throughout the body and brain. The infected mouse then becomes fearless and almost starts taunting the cat — until it’s eaten. The parasite uses this mind-control trick in mice because it can only replicate once it’s inside a cat’s gut.How the parasite hijacks the mouse’s immune systemScientists have now figured out exactly how the parasite hijacks the mouse’s immune cells to get around the body to the brain. Dr. Antonio Barragan, a professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at Stockholm University in Sweden, is the senior author of the study that came out in PLOS Pathogens.After a mouse ingests the parasite, it ends up in the stomach and intestine. And from there it will make its way to the immune cells, which are supposed to be the gatekeepers of the immune system meant to kill invading parasites. Instead these parasites invades the immune cells and gives it orders to be used as a taxi.“The parasite does this in a very clever way. It enters the cells, lives inside in a little cocoon inside the cell. And from there, it starts to communicate with the cell.” – Dr. Antonio Barragan from Stockholm University“The parasite does this in a very clever way,” says Barragan. “It enters the cells, lives inside in a little cocoon inside the cell. And from there, it starts to communicate with the cell.” The message it sends is mediated by the small signaling molecule calcium.“The parasite makes the cell produce also GABA, which is a neurotransmitter, and that triggers an activation — a whole system in the cell.”GABA is the spark that sends the calcium message, which activates the cell to move throughout the body and eventually to the brain.Why it’s importantAfter the parasite replicates in the cat’s intestine, its eggs can come out in the cat’s feces, which can then get eaten up by any number of animals, such as a rodent or a cow. It’s also an extremely common parasite in humans. We can catch it from cleaning cats’ litter boxes or from eating raw meat. For the most part, it’s harmless. It’s only becomes life threatening in those with impaired immune systems and for unborn children, which is why pregnant women shouldn’t clean litter boxes.The Toxoplasma gondii parasite turns mice into fearless zombies, so they’ll get eaten by a cat because the only place the parasite can replicate is in a cat’s gut. (Pixabay)Barragan says he hopes by finding the mechanism of how the parasite moves around the mouse’s body will give scientists a target to design a new treatment to reduce spread.In his experimental study, he did test a blood pressure medication, known to target calcium channels. “Indeed, that medicine had an effect on the spread of the parasite. But I should add that we don’t claim this medicine is a way to cure toxoplasmosis, but we could prove at least that stopping the message from arriving from the parasite could impede the spread of the parasite.”",

    "body": "U.S. lawmakers passed the most significant changes to tax rules in a generation on Wednesday in a move that free market enthusiasts have been clamouring for for years.The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave its second OK to the bill at around 1 p.m. ET. That came after the Senate voted in favour of the bill late Tuesday.The next step will be to send the bill to the White House to become a formal law, which may not happen right away.At an event on the White House lawn on Wednesday, flanked by Republican lawmakers, the president instead celebrated the vote and shared congratulations with Republicans from both houses of the U.S. Congress.Trump called the bill “the largest tax cut in the history of our country.”​It’s the most substantive reform of the U.S. tax system since at least 1986, and a distillation of the ethos that has dominated the Republican Party since the Reagan administration: namely, that cutting taxes and regulations and shrinking government will spur businesses to invest, which will in turn boost the economy by creating jobs and money for all that will trickle down, in time, to ordinary Americans.Not a single Democrat voted for the bill in the Senate.“It would be good in the short term,” said Sung Won Sohn, economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. “Corporate cash flow would improve, helping investments. Businesses would be spending money and then hiring people.”The sprawling, debt-financed legislation cuts the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent, give other business owners a new 20 per cent deduction on business income and reshape how the government taxes multinational corporations along the lines the country’s largest businesses have recommended for years.But millions of Americans would stop itemizing deductions under the bill, which would put tax breaks that incentivize home ownership and charitable donations out of their reach, but also making tax returns somewhat simpler and shorter.The total cost of the legislation is estimated to be at least $1.5 trillion US over the next decade, Toronto-Dominion Bank said in a note to clients Wednesday morning.“It will also add to a national debt level already set to rise,” the bank said. “Over the medium term, this poses several risks to govern­ment finances and the economy. The TCJA ultimately reflects an intergenerational shift of the tax burden to future taxpayers.”The White House and the Treasury Department say it will add as much as a full percentage point to economic growth, but non-partisan estimates are far lower. The Congressional Budget Office says the impact is likely to be closer to 0.12 percentage points per year, on average.TD Bank puts the figure at between 0.1 and 0.3 points per year.The corporate tax cuts would be permanent, but cuts to personal income taxes are set to expire in 2025, something that will “set up a fiscal cliff battleground for a future administration,” TD said.Scotiabank economist Derek Holt, meanwhile, calculated that the tax savings would be heavily skewed toward the top of the income pyramid, so as to make the impact “unnoticeable to most people.”The top 20 per cent of earners will pocket $7,640 on average, and the top one per cent will save $51,140 in taxes. The top 0.1 per cent of earners will save $193,380, Holt said.Meanwhile, “the bottom quintile of earners will save $60 in taxes on average in 2018, or a family breakfast at Denny’s,” Holt said. “What the top 0.1 per cent will save in taxes could almost buy the average priced resale home … and that’s called reform.”Debt-financed legislationIn two provisions added on to secure needed Republican votes, it also would repeal the individual mandate portion of the Obamacare health system and allow oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Democrats have railed against the legislation as a giveaway to the wealthy and the business community that would widen the income gap between rich and poor, while adding $1.5 trillion US over the next decade to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt, which Trump promised in 2016 he would eliminate as president.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, joined at left by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Nov. 7 in Washington, refers to a newspaper article as he challenges claims by Republicans about the party’s tax reform plan. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said the bill “will harm millions of middle-class families … It contains huge, permanent giveaways for big banks and corporations, and asks our children, millions of working Americans and senior citizens, and future generations to pay the price.”Backers of the bill say the tax breaks would spur corporations to invest and hire more workers. But U.S. companies already hold nearly $2.4 trillion US in cash on their books which they aren’t investing, said Joseph Song, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“It’s not like they’re dying for extra cash.”Although Republicans all voted for the bill, a few expressed concerns about its impact on the government debt, by cutting so deeply from tax revenues.Today, the Senate delivered on its promise of allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, a commitment I worked to hold it to by fighting to make sure the bill became a bigger and better tax cut and included repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. — @RandPaulBut the party leadership insists the tax cuts will pay for themselves.Despite Trump administration promises that the tax overhaul would focus on the middle class and not cut taxes for the rich, the non-partisan Tax Policy Centre, a think-tank in Washington, estimated middle-income households would see an average tax cut of $900 US next year under the bill, while the wealthiest 1 per cent of Americans would see an average cut of $51,000.House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin leaves the House chamber after voting on the Republican tax bill Tuesday. Republicans muscled the most sweeping rewrite of U.S. tax laws in more than three decades through the House. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)Republican congressional leaders and White House officials drafted the bill behind closed doors, unveiling it on Sept. 27.No public hearings were held and numerous narrow amendments favoured by lobbyists were added late in the process, tilting the package more toward businesses and the wealthy.“When future generations look back at the short and messy history of the Republican tax bill, its most enduring lesson will be what it has taught us about how not to legislate,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor.U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the bill in television interviews on Wednesday morning, saying support would grow for the tax plan after it passes and Americans felt relief.“I think minds are going to change,” Ryan told ABC’s Good Morning America program.",

Following a tragic accident in which he killed his beloved wife, he has retired his rifle and become a humble herb gatherer limping amongst his cherished mountains.The Japanese governor-general overseeing the occupation gathers tiger pelts as a hobby of seeming cultural dominance, and soon becomes obsessed with killing possibly the last remaining tiger in Korea, an enormous one-eyed male that lives on the mountain and has killed scores of hunters.The tiger is known locally in hushed tones as Mountain Lord, and locals fear its demise will bring wolves and boars return because of its absence. Gu-kyung is the resolute but ruthless leader of a band of Korean hunters that attempt to track and kill the tiger for the bounty, including by killing its mate and two cubs and using them for bait. Eventually, we learn that Man-duk mortally wounded the tiger’s mother when she leapt at him near her kill of an escaped barnyard animal during a winter of privation.He saved the nearby one-eyed cub and its sibling by intervening against the more junior hunter Gu-kyung, who delivered the killing shot on their mother. He told them to leave them to their fate. It is revealed that he secretly relocated them to a safe den, though the sibling soon died. Seok loves a girl in town, and secretly joins one of Gu-kyung’s hunts in aspiration of earning a bounty sufficient to convince her father to allow them to marry; during the hunt, Seok wounds the tiger, but is himself mortally wounded.After several failures, mounting hunter deaths, and facing deepening winter, soldiers of the Japanese army are dispatched to participate in escalating efforts to find and kill the tiger, and several attempts are made to enlist Man-duk to facilitate the hunt, all of which he resolutely resists. However, following Seok’s death and the wounding of the great beast, hunter and tiger, now both bereft of mates and offspring, each tread fatefully toward the snow-blasted mountain top, with the bounty hunters and army in close pursuit. Man-duk reaches the top of the mountain and waits for the tiger. Soon following, the tiger appears. Man-duk and the tiger then seem the fight, with the former injuring the tiger. Man-duk provokes the tiger, asking why he “stopped”, and proceeds to take out a knife at the mountain’s edge. The tiger pounces at him, and they both fall off the mountain together.The governor-general of the Japanese army asks the hunters what happened after the incident, and they relate to him a story about the Mountain Lord becoming a god. The governor-general determined that they are unable to fight during the looming winter and have decided to withdraw until the next spring and proceeds to take his leave. The film ends with flashbacks of Man-duk’s and the tiger’s happier early lives and returning to the present where the bodies of the tiger and Man-duk are lying next to each other as the snow falls and cover their bodies.Commentscomments",

With this, we can figure out that each passengers will pay P2,370.Come to think of it, passengers pay for the operation and maintenance but the profit goes all to the cronies of President Aquino with the total revenue of P73,311,193,140.Samonte said that there seems wrong in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) of President Aquino. this article excerpt from nowreader.comCommentscomments",

    "body": "Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II and National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Director Oscar Albayalde suspect that some members of the police force are involved in a destabilization plot against the Duterte administration.Aguirre and Albayalde met yesterday and discussed the recent killings of teenagers.They wondered why the policemen allegedly killed 17-year-old Kian delos Santos even when there were closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area, as if wanting to broadcast the killing.“It seemed that it was calculated and that they wanted the policemen to be blamed. When the policemen are blamed, it would reflect on the President,” Aguirre said.When asked if he believes that some policemen are in connivance with the destabilization plot, the justice secretary said, “That is very possible. I believe that is what the President said… This could be by the police who are in cahoots with destabilizers and some people in the religious and human rights group.”He believes that the matter is already being looked into by the PNP-Internal Affairs Service.Following reports of a destabilization plot against the administration as revealed by President Duterte, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is monitoring the “security landscape” to deter any groups that might try to disrupt the government.While AFP spokesman Major Gen. Restituto Padilla refuses to confirm the alliance between the Liberal Party (LP) and communist groups, he said the AFP is focused on the movements of some armed groups perceived to be not allies of the government.With regard to the shifting of alliances between political groups and communist rebels, Padilla expressed belief that the President has enough information regarding the matter since he is the commander-in-chief.“The President has access to more information than we do. Because most of our agencies submit to the President information. And we submit to him as well what only comes from our part,” he said.“So we do continue to monitor the security landscape, and that includes other areas not only in Mindanao but the entirety of the archipelago,” Padilla said.When pressed further, Padilla confirmed that the military is watching closely the communist rebels in case they step up attacks.He added that the AFP has intensified monitoring of the communist New People’s Army to deter any unlawful activities of the group following Duterte’s call to stop the peace talks.The NPA has been involved not just in extortion activities, but in destroying and burning equipment, primarily construction and farm implements that affect the livelihood of farmers and other marginalized sectors.“So, if that happens, the most affected are the poor, which we do not want to happen. That’s why we take pains to work closely with big companies who are in agriculture; we take pains to work with construction companies to secure them if they have any threats,” he explained.Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said on Thursday that opposition groups are “capitalizing” on the misdeeds of policemen to destroy the Duterte administration.“The misdeeds of police scalawags will be capitalized on by the opposition and anti-Duterte administration to destroy us because PNP is not really the target… the real target is the President,” Dela Rosa said in a speech at the 116th Police Service Anniversary in Camp Florendo, La Union.“They want to destroy the President through the PNP because they know that we are the organization to closest to the heart of the President because he trusts us in implementing his centerpiece project on drug war,” he added.He claimed critics magnify simple police abuses or wrongdoing “in order to bring down the Duterte administration.”He said he has advised his men to do their job properly and weed their own ranks of erring personnel.“Let’s be vigilant against our erring personnel. Being law enforcers, we face criticisms from various sectors. We endure the risks and danger, not only in the conduct of operations, but also in rescuing and recovering victims of disasters,” he said.",

    "body": "Europe’s top court has provided the final verdict on a multi-years legal challenge brought by EU taxi associations to Uber’s claim that it’s just a technology platform — with the CJEU today ruling it’s a transport service.The judgement means Uber must comply with individual Member States’ transportation regulations, and cannot claim its p2p ride-hailing services are only governed by less restrictive EU-wide ecommerce rules.In its ruling the court writes that Uber’s “intermediation service… must be regarded as being inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as ‘a service in the field of transport’ within the meaning of EU law”.“Consequently, such a service must be excluded from the scope of the freedom to provide services in general as well as the directive on services in the internal market and the directive on electronic commerce. It follows that, as EU law currently stands, it is for the Member States to regulate the conditions under which such services are to be provided.”As we reported earlier this year, an influential advocate general opinion had indicated the decision would not go Uber’s way — with the CJEU advisor stating that Uber “exerts control over all the relevant aspects of an urban transport service”.Responding to the court’s final verdict, an Uber spokesperson emailed this statement: “This ruling will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law. However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe. This is the approach we’ll take to ensure everyone can get a reliable ride at the tap of a button.”The original legal challenge was filed in 2014 by a professional taxi drivers’ association in Barcelona — seeking a declaration from that court that the activities of Uber Systems Spain amount to misleading practices and acts of unfair competition. In order to determine that matter, the court decided it needed a judgement on whether the services provided by Uber are transport services, information society services or a combination of both. Hence the case being referred to the CJEU.While the court’s verdict is certainly a blow to Uber’s expansion ambitions in Europe, the company does already operate under transportation regulations in some European markets, such as in London. (Albeit, it has currently has its license to operate there withdrawn for unrelated reasons.)So Uber’s contention is it will not change how it operates in most EU countries.The ruling also only pertains to Uber’s peer-to-peer ride-hailing services — which have long faced out-and-out bans in multiple European markets, such as France, Spain and Belgium.In some of these EU markets Uber has gone on to relaunch professional services (i.e. non-p2p ride hailing, using licensed drivers) — including in Berlin and Madrid — apparently complying with local transport rules.Although in Spain, at least, local taxi associations are still striking and protesting at the presence of Uber and other ride-hailing firms, claiming that rules which are supposed to limit the number of taxi licenses to operate are being broken.What’s clear now is the CJEU’s decision cements the need for Uber to work with local authorities and regulators in each and every EU market and city where it operates. It also closes the door on Uber being able to restart the engine of p2p ride-hailing expansion in Europe.So any faint hope the company might still have entertained of being given a legal green light to speed down a digital EU fast-lane and overtake local transport interests is gone.Even as taxi association blowback and regulatory and political pressure have already pushed it to conform to existing transport rules in many markets.While in others what Uber has characterized as ‘hostile’ regulatory climates have resulted in it pulling its service altogether. (Though, more likely, it has just done a cost-benefit analysis and determined that a small market — like Denmark — is not worth its while to put in time and lobbying cash to try to flip the regulatory regime to something less restrictive.)The company may be hoping that the legal clarity provided by the CJEU’s ruling on ride-hailing apps pushes cities and local authorities to accelerate reforms of existing rules to more generously accommodate the new generation of app-based players.Though existing taxi associations will also be pushing in an equal and opposite direction against any changes they don’t like.New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi certainly represents a welcome break with the old Uber and its aggressive style of business — and has signaled a desire to work with local lawmakers, as well as apologizing for past mistakes, managing to sound genuinely contrite and constructive.But the reality for the still profit-less company is that its operational costs only look set to rise, as legal rulings unpick exploitable loopholes — at the same time as regulatory roadblocks are cemented in place to close down its old rapid expansion playbook.And as the cost of still emerging liabilities come home to roost.In the UK, for instance, Uber has just lost its first appeal against an employment tribunal verdict that ruled a group of its drivers are workers, not self-employed contractors — and are therefore entitled to benefits such as holiday pay.Uber has said that if it has to fund such benefits for all ~50,000 of its local drivers it would cost it “tens of millions” of pounds.The UK government is also looking at changing employment law to reflect “modern” gig economy platform work — and will clearly be keen to protect its own tax takings which have been dented by an algorithmically accelerated boom in ‘self-employment’.“Uber does not charge VAT on the basis that it is for the self-employed drivers who supply the services to register with HMRC to charge VAT,” notes Rachel Farr, senior employment lawyer at international law firm Taylor Wessing, commenting on the implications of the ruling in a statement.“Now that the ECJ has said that Uber itself is a transportation company, that will put further pressure on Uber to charge VAT. This would immediately increase the cost of fares by 20%, even before the extra costs such as the minimum wage and paid holiday if the drivers are treated as workers.”Add to that politicians in Europe and elsewhere appear increasingly willing to give tech firms a public hosing — whether it be over tax, safety or wider societal problems being exacerbated by their products — and there’s a sense that the tide of public opinion is no longer going to be swayed just because you have a shiny app.Even less for Uber whose company reputation has been shredded by a string of corporate governance and internal scandals — including its disclosure last month of a data breach in 2016 affecting 57 million of its users and drivers. Instead of informing regulators when it learnt about the breach, Uber’s then management sought to conceal it by paying off the hackers.That decision is yet another that seems likely to be an expensive one for Uber — both financially and, perhaps more importantly, in the eyes of the regulators and lawmakers that it increasingly needs to have on its side.Its competitors are certainly wasting no time in painting themselves as ‘constructive disruptors’ and jockeying for favor as a more reliable local partner for cities to work with.",

His satisfaction rating for Visayas and Luzon, however, decreased by 30 points and 22 points, respectively.Duterte’s net satisfaction rating stayed at “very good” for classes ABC with +57, just two points below his June rating.The third quarter SWS survey was conducted from Sept. 23 to 27 this year with face-to-face interviews of 1,500 adults nationwide (600 in Balance Luzon and 300 each in Metro Manila, Visayas and Mindanao).It had sampling error margins of ±2.5 percent for national; ±4 percent for Balance Luzon; and ±6 percent each for Metro Manila, Visayas and Mindanao.For the public satisfaction rating, the respondents were asked the question: “Please tell me how satisfied or dissatisfied you are with the performance of Rodrigo Duterte as president of the Philippines.

After gaining lots of very useful contacts from the House of Representatives, I have discovered that the much-touted supermajority has finally started flexing its legislative muscles.Inday, ilabas na ang chopping block!Yesterday, Senator Richard Gordon finally filed an ethics complaint against Senator Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV. Referring to the complaint, Gordon said in an ambush interview yesterday, “It’s going to be filed today... I don’t need signatories. I have the support of more than 10, more than 12, more than 14 [senators] [Yes, the wheels have started turning and the public is very happy with the development, but let’s not lose sight of the forest for trees, because it appears that Trillanes’ expulsion from the senate is just a small part of a series of moves in what appears to be a chess gambit.DEFINITION: A gambit (from ancient Italian gambetto, meaning \"to trip\") is a chess opening in which a player, more often White, sacrifices material, usually a pawn, with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position [Brace 1979] There are four key pieces involved in this gambit:Senator Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno Commission on Elections (COMELEC) chair Andres “Andy” Bautista Vice-president Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo That is, a series of events, starting with Trillanes expulsion, will lead to a political chain reaction that may virtually annihilate any significant level of power that the Liberal Party has today.Note that this will not be an article about what should happen. It is instead about what will likely happen in the Philippine political scene, an arena that’s has so far been more lively and exciting than even the sappiest Mexican telenovela.Let’s go.Move No. 1: “Impeach” Trillanes In Sunday’s “Gordon, however, said yesterday that he has the support of 14 or more senators, so it appears that Gordon may have secured the Gatchalian’s support.A highly-placed source from the senate independently confirmed that Sen. Gatchalian is very likely to support Gordon’s petition. So yeah, it seems that Gordon isn’t bluffing.While some netizens tell me that this should have been filed a long time ago. But then, remember that a certain Abelardo de Jesus filed an ethics complaint against Trillanes back in March 2017, and it didn’t gain any traction [As far as I am concerned, it’s just a matter of time before Trillanes, along with his horde of consultants, bids the Senate goodbye.Trillanes’ pending exit, along with Sen. Leila de Lima’s detention and Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano’s resignation, will put the total number of active senators to just 21. Thus, the original two-thirds majority from 16 (based on 24 senators) will be reduced to 14 (based on 21), making convictions in impeachment trials much easier to achieve.As I have explained in my 26 August 2017 article “Now, let's set that aside and talk about Andy. Yesterday, Senator Richard Gordon finally filed an ethics complaint against Senator Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV. Referring to the complaint, Gordon said in an ambush interview yesterday, “It’s going to be filed today... I don’t need signatories.

There will only be 20 or 21 senators who will vote on the complaint.Gordon, however, said yesterday that he has the support of 14 or more senators, so it appears that Gordon may have secured the Gatchalian’s support.A highly-placed source from the senate independently confirmed that Sen.

But then, remember that a certain Abelardo de Jesus filed an ethics complaint against Trillanes back in March 2017, and it didn’t gain any traction [ ABS ]. That is, I think Gordon’s complaint was filed at just about the right time because it gave Trillanes enough time to piss off a sufficient number of senators.As far as I am concerned, it’s just a matter of time before Trillanes, along with his horde of consultants, bids the Senate goodbye.Trillanes’ pending exit, along with Sen. Leila de Lima’s detention and Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano’s resignation, will put the total number of active senators to just 21. Thus, the original two-thirds majority from 16 (based on 24 senators) will be reduced to 14 (based on 21), making convictions in impeachment trials much easier to achieve.As I have explained in my 26 August 2017 article “ Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt ”, there are eight would-be senator-judges who are likely to vote “acquit” in a prospective impeachment trial and that one of them is Trillanes. If Trillanes exits the senate, the maximum number of “acquittal” votes will be 7. Adding the fact that only 21 will be voting, Trillanes’ exit makes a “sure acquittal” scenario impossible.Now, let's set that aside and talk about Andy.Move No. 2: Impeach Bautista There are several impeachment cases filed in the House of Representatives (HoR) today. They involve the following figures:Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno Commission on Elections (COMELEC) chair Andres “Andy” Bautista Vice-president Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales is set to retire in July 2018, or barely over ten months from now. Honestly speaking – and I believe most congressmen will agree with me – I think that impeaching Carpio-Morales will be a waste of time for the simple reason that she’s about to exit anyway. Meanwhile, I have read the verified complaint for the impeachment of Comelec chair Andy Bautista filed by Atty. Ferdie Topacio and former Negros Oriental Rep. Jacinto Paras. You can read for yourselfA source, who’s part of the HoR leadership, told me that Bautista has sent feelers to the office of House Speaker Pantaleon “Bebot” Alvarez. That is, Bautista supposedly informed the House leadership that he is intending to resign from his position soon.With that said, I believe that the Lower House is giving Bautista some time to do it, so that it can focus on the other pending impeachment complaints, one of which may be transmitted to the Senate sooner than expected, and I am referring to…Move No. 3: Impeach Sereno There are two verified complaints for the impeachment of Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno: one filed by Atty. Lorenzo “Larry” Gadon, and another by the non-government organization Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC). So far, Gadon’s complaint has been endorsed by 25 representatives [Interestingly, another senior HoR source told me that a large number of representatives have volunteered to endorse these complaints but the House Speaker told them not to sign them yet, and for good reason.You see, I checked the executive summary of Gadon’s complaint and the number of grounds cited is mind-boggling. For example, Topacio’s 22-page impeachment complaint against Bautista cites only four or five grounds, while Gadon cited TWENTY SEVEN. By simple ratio and proportion, Gadon’s actual complaint must’ve been almost a hundred pages long, and that’s not even counting the annexes!Among the grounds cited are the following:Falsifying two Supreme Court resolutions and a temporary restraining order, Delaying action on the retirement benefits of judicial personnel, Manipulating and delaying a resolution after she lost in the voting, Manipulating shortlists of judicial nominees in three different occasions, Manipulating the Judicial and Bar Council itself, Using public funds to finance an extravagant lifestyle, including booking opulent hotel rooms, flying on first class, and having large contingents during official foreign visits. Ordering Muntinlupa judges not to issue warrants of arrest against Sen. Leila de Lima The list goes on and on. There are several impeachment cases filed in the House of Representatives (HoR) today.

Among the four or so grounds for impeachment cited, I believe that the fourth ground – SALN misdeclaration – is more than enough to get Bautista convicted in a senate impeachment trial.A source, who’s part of the HoR leadership, told me that Bautista has sent feelers to the office of House Speaker Pantaleon “Bebot” Alvarez.

Pwedeng gawin… Pero ayaw kong gawin. Kasi gusto ko, dito pa lang i-hearing muna natin. Para makita muna natin kung may ebidensya ba o wala, whether it can stand trial in an impeachment court.”Yeah, I appreciate Bebot’s prudence because there’s no point in hearing all twenty-seven grounds, as proving just one ground will be enough to remove Sereno from the judiciary.I find Gadon’s complaint exceptionally long and meaty, and it happens to be so because…According to another HoR source, Supreme Court associate justices who have grudges against Sereno very willingly provide the evidence for her impeachment case. The source even told me that one of the associate justices keeps on calling a senior congressman to ask the latter about the progress of the complaint.With that said, I am confident that the proponents of the impeachment case against Sereno will find no trouble in looking for evidence. Adding the fact that the pro-Sereno Senate minority bloc lacks numbers, I can confidently say that Sereno, like Trillanes, is toast. Suffice it to say, submitting this lengthy complaint as it is, may result in a senate trial that’ll last forever.You can check the executive summary of the impeachment case against CJ Sereno by clicking here Thus, I agree with Speaker Alvarez when he said said, \"Kung gusto lang namin na dumiretso sa impeachment court, kayang-kaya.

Is he supporting Duterte with this?\"Whether I support him or not, we will be under martial law if he declares it. What can I do? I will not oppose him. How can I, I'm no longer in politics? If they can't find a different methodology to control the situation, he might declare martial law\"He totally agreed with the President's decision to declare September 21 a holiday and have people rally on the streets, but warned them to not destroy or hurt people or vandalize.\"The police are an instrument of the state; if they violate their sworn duty and go out of line, they have to be brought to court. And that's exactly what's going on\"Enrile served as Defense Minister for 17 years and when asked about his thoughts in Marawi, he stated that the government would be lucky if they are able to control it in one year.He goes, \" ISIS is a worldwide problem, that's why I said the President has bigger problems than we encountered back then (during Marcos' time) the constabulary, which is now PNP, and the military were consolidated under one department, which was under me. Our problems were the MNLF, CPP-NPA, that's it. We don't have ISIS, we don't have the drug problem\"He also warned everyone that there are \"some people\" who wanted to bring the \"North Korean ideology\" in the Philippines. And Enrile said those people were the ones holding the guns rules.source philstarEnrile's Take on the Possible Martial Law DeclarationSenator Juan Ponce Enrile is a politician and lawyer. He has served during Marcos time as Justice Secretary and then Defence Minister and later on became one of the leaders during the 1986 People Power Revolution. He continued to be a prominent politician since then and was Senate President from November 2008. He resigned on June 5 2013.When asked about his take on the possible declaration of Martial Law on the 21st, the senator stated that we should be thankful that our President is trying to solve all the problems that we are currently facing as a country.\"In a way you should be thankful that Duterte came because he's now working to solve the drug problem, the criminality of the police or tulisan, ISIS and all these; at the age of 72! Would you rather live under a system like North Korea? That is the prototype of the system some people want to install in this country\"From all the experiences he had and taking part in Marcos' time, the former Senate President believes that Duterte is facing much bigger problems nowadays than Marcos.\"Duterte might declare martial law because he has bigger probles now than Marcos. He has the communist insurgency, ISIS, a big drug proble, a vociferous opposition and the traditional problem of Mindanao\"",

    "body": "44 SHARES Share TweetOne of the problems with today’s economy is that it’s very hard to find young people who are good salesmen.Many students coming out of college are more interested in a customer’s motivation than they are in closing a sale.They also have a tendency to be too honest, which can play havoc in the retail business.A friend of mine has a dress shop here in Georgetown, and she told me of the problems she had with a young lady, a psychology major, whom she had hired as a salesgirl.This, in essence, is what happened:The first day a lady came in the store, and the salesgirl (let us call her Miss Brampton) asked if she could be of help.“I’d like a suit for the fall,” the lady said.“What price range?” Miss Brampton asked.“It doesn’t make any difference,” the lady replied.“Well, let me ask you this question: Do you want the suit because you need it? Or have you just had a fight with your husband and are trying to get even by making a very expensive purchase?”“I beg your pardon?” the lady said.“Perhaps you suspect he has a girlfriend, and you think this is the only way you can get back at him.”“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” the customer said.“Spending money in anger is a very expensive form of hostility. My advice to you is to think it over for a few days. Try to patch up your differences. Buying a new suit won’t save your marriage.”“Thank you very much,” the customer said coldly and left the store.“She’s angry with me now,” Miss Brampton told the dress shop owner, “but in a week she’ll be grateful I talked her out of it.”My friend who was the shop owner decided to let the incident pass;but that afternoon another customer came in, and Miss Brampton asked if she could be of help.The lady said, “I need something really exciting. I’m going to the Kennedy Center, and I want a dress that will knock everyone dead.”Miss Brampton said, “We have some lovely evening dresses over here for insecure people.”“Insecure people?”“Oh, yes. Didn’t you know that clothes are one of the main ways women compensate for insecurity?”“I’m not insecure,” the lady said angrily.“Then why do you want to knock them dead at the Kennedy Center? Why can’t you be accepted for yourself instead of what you wear? You are a very attractive person, and you have an inner beauty you try to disguise. I can sell you a new dress that will attract attention, but then you would never know if it was you or the dress that made people stop and stare.”By this time the dress shop owner decided to step in.“Miss Brampton, if the lady wants an evening dress, let her see our evening dresses.”“No,” the customer said.“Your girl is right. Why spend five hundred dollars to get a few compliments from people who really don’t care what I wear? Thank you for helping me, young lady. It’s true I’ve been insecure all these years and didn’t even know it.” The customer walked out of the store.The last straw for the dress store owner took place an hour later when a college student came in to buy a miniskirt, and Miss Brampton gave her thirty minutes on women’s lib and then said,“All you do when you buy miniskirts is to become a sex object.”That night the dress shop owner put a sign in the window:HELP WANTED — NO PSYCHOLOGY MAJORS NEED APPLY.",

    "body": "Coa must now do a real auditI APPLAUD President Duterte’s recent tirade against his predecessor Benigno S. Aquino 3rd and the latter’s budget secretary, Florencio Abad, over their Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP), which was really an unprecedented, mammoth hijacking of government funds.One of my biggest frustrations as a journalist, when I realized how puny the role of the press really is in this oligarch-ruled country, was during the previous administration when I wrote more than a dozen columns on the DAP, based not on opinion or haka-haka but on documents. Yet the Aquino government in its arrogance never commented or attempted to debunk a single one of my allegations.My columns mainly dealt with:• How DAP was thinly, stupidly disguised as an economic-stimulus program. Quite amazingly, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales swallowed this five-year-old lie in her recent decision acquitting Aquino of complicity over such hijacking of government funds. As the World Bank’s July 2012 update explained it, DAP was useless to the economy as it was a “mere realignment of funds”; and, while a huge loot for the Aquino camp’s purse, it was “minuscule (at less than 0.01 percentage points) relative to the size of the economy”.• How it threw the Constitution into the dustbin, since it is Congress that has the power of the purse;• How it was used to bribe senators to take out Chief Justice Renato Corona, which was a never-before-attempted attack on the judiciary; and• How this huge fund very likely ended up in the pockets of the Aquino’s Yellow Cult, his inner core of officials, Congress members, and even local government officials.It is understandable why Aquino could get away with such a crime when he was in power. The Senate was a recipient of the funds, so why would they investigate it. Our people had been brainwashed that the Yellow Cult would save the country, and of course the oligarchs had pending applications to build lucrative infrastructure projects, and supported Aquino.Slammed mediaDuterte slammed the media for not reporting on the DAP issue, scolding them: “Kayong mga media ngayon, ba’t gobyerno ko lang? Ba’t di nyo kalkalin si Abad? Anong nagawa ni Abad?” he said.Why? Because media, except for a handful of articles (as headlined in the image accompanying this column), had been Aquino’s cheering squad in his decapitation of the Supreme Court, which was possible only because of the bribes from the DAP. How could they have done investigative journalism on the DAP when they were part of Aquino’s lynch mob against Corona?Remember that screaming false, front-paged article claiming that Corona even got the University of Santo Tomas to give him a Ph. D. without his working for it reported by the PCIJ and the Philippine Daily Inquirer, intended to paint him as so thoroughly dishonest, which was the opening shot in his Senate trial? That was such a low point in Philippine journalism.If the Mamasapano SAF 44 massacre was the Aquino regime’s bloodiest crime, the DAP was its most lucrative one, and justice must be served on both of these, so we can strengthen our institutions, an imperative for our nation’s growth.The DAP was such a huge crime. Yet in the view of Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales there was really no perpetrator, and in her decision asked Abad to only pay a fine of about P120,000, or his basic salary for three months?Morales herself in her decision said Abad was guilty of the “usurpation of legislative powers”. You usurp the powers of the second branch of government and you’re just asked to pay a fine? No wonder our republic’s institutions are in such a mess.I hope that the post-Aquino Commission on Audit would have the integrity to investigate the simple question: Where did the DAP money go?The following is an example of one of the columns I wrote on the DAP issue (published July 9, 2012):DiscrepanciesConsider these discrepancies in the official reports from Abad on how much of the DAP funds were released:• According to the document “Frequently Asked Questions about the Disbursement Acceleration Program” posted on the websites of the DBM and the Official Gazette (www.gov.ph), DAP funds released from 2011 to 2013 totaled P157.4 billion.• According to “Evidence Packet No. 1,” which the DBM through the Solicitor General submitted to the Supreme Court during its hearings on the case, the DAP funds released totaled P149.2 billion (cited inpage 2 of Senior Justice Antonio Carpio’sconcurring opinion).• According to Abad’s memorandum to the President dated December 28, 2013 that recommended the termination of the scheme, DAP funds released in the same period amounted to P144.3 billion.• And finally, according to the DBM’s press statement issued July 4, the DAP amounted to only P136.8 billion.Did you notice how the funds kept getting smaller? But these aren’t just minor discrepancies due to some clerical error. The last three amounts mean P8 billion to P21 billion less than the amount in the first report.What happened to the money? Who pocketed this missing P8 to P21 billion? These discrepancies alone are reason enough to fire Abad, being the brains and creator of the DAP.Two of Abad’s memos to the President in fact were even sent to him through the President’s “Private Office”—as the “receipt” stamps on these show—and not to the Office of the President, obviously to bypass Ochoa. Documents sent to the “Private Office” since these are precisely considered “Private” are not recorded in Malacanang’s Records Office.Already there have been denials of receiving DAP funds as claimed by government. Senator Joker Arroyo, known for his probity and one of the few who didn’t accept pork barrel money, strongly denied that his office received P47 million in DAP funds. But the Aquino government claimed that the good senator received DAP money.Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council president Manuel Sanchez similarly denied that his agency, chaired by Vice President Jejomar Binay, received P2.2 billion in DAP funds, as Abad’s records claimed.DAP funds unreportedSeveral of the DAP funds supposedly released also were not reported in the recipient agencies’ annual audits by the Commission on Audit.Some P6.5 billion of DAP funds were purportedly released to the Department of Interior and Local Governments (DILG) in 2011 and 2012. However, there is no report of such huge infusion of funds in the COA’s annual audits of the DILG.The only reference to the DAP was in its 2012 audit which noted that out of the P1 billion funding for the department’s so-called Performance Challenge Fund (extra funds given to local governments), some P253 million were supposedly from “DBM’s Disbursement Allocation Fund.”Some P1.8 billion of DAP funds were, according to Abad, released to the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) for its funding of a rebel group’s “livelihood projects”.There is no record of such receipt of funds from the DAP in the COA’s audit reports of the OPAPP for 2011 and 2012. A huge amount of DAP money released to a government office, but no COA recognition or audit?Some P8.6 billion of DAP funds were released to the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) for the so-called “Transition Investment Support Plan.” Aquino even boasted about this funding in a public event in Cotabato City, and ARMM governor Mujiv Hataman was reported – even photographed – distributing P10 million checks from the DAP to local officials in the region in January 2013. (See my column July 1, 2014, “Aquino used P9B of DAP funds for his Nobel Prize fantasy”).“This year (2013), the government has committed P8.59 billion for the Transition Investment Support Plan on top of the P12.93 billion already allocated through our budget,” Aquino was quoted in several newspapers at the time.But the COA’s audit of the ARMM for 2011 to 2013 doesn’t have any reference to this money, and the regional government’s cash inflow do not reflect any increase in its funds from the national government.Nearly P9 billion in taxpayers’ money, and not audited by the COA? Was the DAP intended to fall between the cracks in the government’s accounting system? [source]Commentscomments",

The apparent victim did not let it slip and confronted the perpetrator by ripping his shirt and introducing her palms to his face repeatedly.The woman can be seen trying to drag the man outside of the train presumably because she do not want to cause further inconvenience other commuters than her confrontation with the man already did. \"Lumabas ka\", she demanded repeatedly but the man won't oblige and said \"Pumasok ka na lang\". The woman had the way of it though after other passengers added their voice to hers threatening the man that they would push him outside if he would go on his own accord.The security guard eventually stepped in leaving the alleged pervert no choice but to step off the train.We condemn all violence against women especially those done in public but what made this video more interesting is the boy with the cap on. During the commotion, the sneaky little man saw the opportunity to make a living and took it. He fished something out of the pocket of the man that was being slapped by the woman. It was crazy!

    "body": "The country will have a weak national police force if each policeman will listen to every statement and warning issued by human rights advocates from the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) or the United Nations (UN), the incoming Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief said yesterday.“If we are afraid of these investigating bodies, nothing will happen. All the policemen will become bayot (gay); nobody will already address this problem,” Chief Superintendent Ronald dela Rosa, President-elect Rodrigo R. Duterte’s handpicked national police chief, said over radio station DZ Dobol B.Dela Rosa said that what this country needs in going after violent criminals – like those involved in illegal drug activities – are extreme measures in which the government can display its might.“We need extreme measures but that are legal. We need violence to stop this because they (illegal drug lords) are very violent,” he said. “And we expect them (drug lords) not to easily give up because of the huge sum of money involved. They have been enjoying the good life for a very long time so we don’t expect them to easily give up.”Earlier, CHR officials declared that it will stand its ground in fighting for victims of human rights and these include criminals whom it said also deserve due process.The CHR was reacting to warnings made by both Dela Rosa and Duterte that shoot-to-kill orders will be issued against criminals.Recently, the United Nations Rapporteurs also hit the incoming Duterte administration for endorsement of extra-judicial killings in the country.The incoming PNP Chief said those advocating human rights must understand that they, too, will benefit when streets and the communities are purged of criminals.Unless the streets are rid of illegal drugs, drug lords will continue to wield power until this country eventually becomes a narcopolitical state, Dela Rosa said.Right now, Dela Rosa said it is the drug lords who seem to be powerful as revealed by the fact that they are still able to run their business even inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP), which is the state penitentiary.“They can bribe policemen; they can bribe fiscals; they can bribe judges and even prison officials. If we are not going to implement extreme measures, sila ang magiging siga-siga sa ating mga community (they will lord it over our communities),” said he said.source: manila bulletinCommentscomments",

To us?Ummm…every day we wait breathlessly for what I know will be another day of biting remarks, expletives and verbal ejaculations like that most recent wolf whistle.Some people say it is the product of a complex mastermind but you and I both know that you’re just being yourself – a bad boy. A very bad boy who gets excited by incensing people, annoying them and sparking discord in an already divided country.Oooh, Digong, you’re so bad you should be spanked.You are not even officially President yet, but you certainly don’t disappoint. Every day you give it to us, harder, deeper than the last time.You were annoyed that you, as Mayor, were not given first dibs to an Australian missionary. You cursed the Pope. And then admonished the United Nations, the multi-agency group that is one of the Philippines’s largest donors. My eyes cannot help but widen each time you brazenly show us that no one could possibly be bigger than you.Whenever you display your manhood like that, it makes me bite my lower lip in anticipation. I know you won’t stop. You will just keep it coming and coming.I know. I shouldn’t be talking like this to the highest elected official in the land, the one who will represent our country and stand alongside other world leaders. I know. You’re old enough to be a grandfather. But I can’t help it. This is what you bring out in me, what you bring out in every person you touch with your words. You are a madman, wild and drunk with power and you are unstoppable.You always need to be the man on top. Wolf-whistling a female journalist (would you do it to a male one, I wonder? C’mon, haven’t you ever wondered what it’s like to get it from behind?) to make a joke at her expense, to make her feel uncomfortable and unsafe? To annoy and insult her husband – just because you think you can. Just because you cannot pass up a chance to show that you’re the man.I imagine you watching from your throne as the country tears itself apart. Filipino against Filipino, all in the name of Digong. Some screaming, “Digong, yes!” Others chanting, “Digong, no!”You like that, don’t you? You like it rough. You like it dirty.You need to show that you’ve earned the nickname “The Punisher” even if, by your own admission, you need to pop a Viagra pill first to do it.Oh, have I insulted you? Or have I flattered you?",

    "body": "Antonio Fuentes Trillanes IV, or Sonny to his relatives and friends, was born and raised in Caloocan City. He traces his roots to Ligao, Albay in Bicol where his late father, Antonio Sr., grew up. His mother, Estelita, hails from the province of Capiz.Sonny is 35 years old; born on August 6, 1971. He is married to the former Arlene G. Orejana with two children namely: Francis Seth and Thea Estelle. Their third child, Alan Andrew, died of an illness while he was just twenty-one days old.He studied at De La Salle University in Manila where he took up BS ECE from 1987 to 1991.He formally entered into public service in 1991 as a cadet in the Philippine Military Academy where he graduated Cum Laude in 1995, while earning a degree in BS Naval System Engineering. Other awards he received while in PMA are the Mathematics Plaque, Physical Science Plaque, and the Tambuli Award for electrical/electronics engineering.In 2002, Sonny took up graduate studies at the University of the Philippines and got his masters degree in Public Administration major in Public Policy and Program Management. For the duration of the masteral program, he received two University Scholar Awards for obtaining two semestral GPAs of 1.0 to 1.25 and a College Scholar Award for obtaining a semestral GPA of 1.25 to 1.50.After graduating from PMA, Sonny went through all shipboard assignments starting from Mess & Supply Officer; Deck & Gunnery Officer; Engineering & Damage Control Officer; Executive Officer; and, ultimately as Acting Commanding Officer of a patrol gunboat.During his five-year sea duty experience, his unit apprehended dozens of smugglers, illegal loggers, poachers, human smugglers and illegal fishermen in numerous maritime law enforcement operations conducted in the waters off Batanes, Ilocos, Cagayan, Isabela, Zambales, Scarborough, Quezon, Bicol, Palawan, Mindoro, Romblon, Iloilo, Cebu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Davao and Maguindanao.Other shore positions he held were: Administrative/Personnel Officer of Philippine Fleet Patrol Force; and Procurement Officer/Instructor, Naval Education & Training Command.Among the highlights of his military profession, was the daring search and rescue operation for the survivors of the ill-fated M/V Princess of the Orient at the height of a super typhoon in 1998.

    "body": "The Tagean- Tallano gold started at 720,000 tons . 640,000 tons were transported to the Vatican and back, leaving 80,000 tons unaccounted from the outset.Out of 640,000 tons, 192,000 tons were paid in commission, which should be leave 448,000 tons- but somehow hat number as become 400,000 tons , leaving another 48,000 tons unaccounted.Following this story there are 128,000 (80,000 plus 48,000) tons of gold which somehow ” slipped through the cracks” in addition to 192,000 earned in commission, WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN.. Opppsss!!!Out of the remaining 400,000 tons we do not know how much remains. We know there was an effort to do a major ” disappearing act” when the old Central Bank morphed into the new Bangko Sentral Pilipinas- but a recent decision of the SUPREME COURT ( Banco Filipino versus BSP ) has upheld that BSP is responsible for the liabilities of the old Central Bank.The POINT is that ultimately , a complete accounting should show where ALL of the original 720, 000 tons WENT- not to mention estimated 1.2 MILLION tons of Yamashita treasure ( combined German and Japanese plunder) identified above ( that is very nearly TWO MILLION TONS OF GOLD worth more than $38 TRILLION at todays price 2006)The phony, CIA backed EDSA ” PEOPLE POWER ” exhibition of 1986 had one primary purpose and that was to take this vast QUANTITY OF GOLD from the Philippines and the FILIPINO PEOPLE for the benefit of the INTERNATIONAL BANKING CARTEL to enslave mankind.WHAT ABOUT FR. DIAZ COMMISSION SHARED WITH FERDINAND MARCOS?When Fr. Jose Antonio Diaz , died in 1974 all the 30% COMMISSION in gold became the legendary ” MARCOS GOLD” . After providing for his family in Marcos ‘ Letter of Instruction, the whole wealth derived from this was supposed to be given to the FILIPINO PEOPLE . This was the “MARCOS WEALTH” that some POLITICIAN and CHURCHMEN kept on saying was the:” ILL – GOTTEN ” Marcos Wealth..WHY THIS WEALTH HAS BEEN LABELED ” ILL – GOTTEN ” a little further along in our STUDY , that unti today is in MARCOS SECRET ACCOUNTS.– On April 9, 1973 Marcos said: “MY EARTHLY GOODS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE CUSTODY AND FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MARCOS FOUNDATION DEDICATED TO THE WELFARE OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE.”In his GRAND PLAN, MARCOS wanted to RE ESTABLISHED the former grandeur of MAHARLIKA and the whole region of SOUTHEAST ASIA , the former MALAYAN EMPIRE.In June 1983, Marcos appeared before the First World leaders in Toronto. He announced his plan to boost economy of the Southeast Asia Region by creating ASIAN DOLLAR. This would be backed up by the 400,000 metric tons of gold in Central Bank.The ASIAN DOLLAR , backed up by the two thirds of all gold in the world that was in the Maharlika. Would made the Maharlika money more valuable and stronger that the American dollar. This was his vision to raise Southeast Asia to be par with the rest of the first world countries.There is plenty of solid evidence of a program MARCOS worked on with American President Ronald Reagan, which referred to as the ABL ( ANG BAGONG LIPUNAN) program. Under this program some 250 sets of gold , documentation and related ABL currency were to be shipped to various countries around the world.—-WHAT BECAME OF THE REMAINING 400,000 metric TONS PERTAINING TO THE TAGEAN – TALLANO CLAN and where is it today?To this day, the 400,000 metric tons of GOLD are still in the CENTRAL BANK in East Avenue , Quezon City. NOBODY CAN MOVE it because Marcos insured it with the LLOYDS OF LONDON and its agents are guarding it.—-BUT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ITS EXISTENCE.—Not only have SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS of the Philippines failed to ACKNOWLEDGE the existence of the GOLD, they have CONSPIRED to keep this information from being KNOWN to the Filipino People.We assume this is because they have been working at ways to convert the GOLD for their own selfish gain, probably in conspiracy with the International Banking Cartel.Immediately after Ferdinand Marcos was REMOVED from the office by a U.S MILITARY helicopter , the NEWLY installed PRESIDENT CORAZON AQUINO , formed the PCGG- Presidential Commission on Good Government, PURPORTEDLY to go after the Marcos – ILL GOTTEN WEALTH.” IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CONSPIRATORS THAT THIS WEALTH SHOULD BE LABELLED ~~ILL – GOTTEN~~ even though, as has already been shown , MR MARCOS was in his OWN RIGHT the WEALTHIEST MAN on the face of the EARTH and had absolutely no need to take anything from anyone.A decision of the FEDERAL SUPREME COURT OF SWITZERLAND dated December 21,1990 said……”… By decision of May 29,1986 , the attorney general of District of Zurich accepted in principle to the legal assistance requested by the PHILIPPINES and invited all the banks of the City of Zurich to FREEZE IMMEDIATELY all the accounts, deposits or safes of the persons, companies or foundations ( of MARCOS) in the order….”THE ACCOUNTS WERE FROZEN at the request of the government of the Philippines and the PCGG has ensured they have remained FROZEN to this day.This is all a GRAND SCHEME OR SCAM. BLINDED Filipinos must keep repeating that MARCOS was a THEIF ( MAGNANAKAW) so that those HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of DOLLARS of Marcos Money will remain FROZEN and not be given to them for their use..Consequently, they MUST CONSTANTLY BORROW MONEY from International Monetary Fund( IMF) and World Bank ( WB) with SO MUCH INTEREST so that this COUNTRY WILL REMAIN A SLAVE and SHACKLED to the foreign powers.HISTORY will show that the money was not stashed away and inaccessible but AVAILABLE to truly deserving Filipinos.There was NOTHING SECRET about Marcos Accounts. These ACCOUNTS were ONLY MADE SECRET by some people in the government so that the PUBLIC would not know its REAL STORY.GOLD FOR GOLD , DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, this country , the Maharlika is the RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.During a talk show in U.S TV the week following the bombing of the New York Twin Towers, PRES BUSH was asked this question:WHICH IS THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TODAY ? With a smile he said : THE PHILIPPINES, Marcos knew it, but he could not talk.At the time they made sure that MARCOS would not longer talk. After kidnapping him from Malacanang , they put him in a golden prison in HawaiiAccording to Global Finance, the richest country in the world, based on gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing-power-parity (PPP) per capita, is Qatar, second Luxembourg, and third Singapore. The Philippines is ranked 118th.Watch the video below:",

Drilon, tinawag na ganti sa nakaraang administrasyon ang bantang kaso laban sa kanila kaugnay sa PDAF scam | via @ZandroDZMM pic.twitter.com/v1m8HKfq52 — DZMM TeleRadyo (@DZMMTeleRadyo) May 29, 2017“Nakausap ko na po actually ang kanyang lawyer. Ang sabi niya, in a few days, maglalabas na sila ng kaukulang habla at ifa-file ata nila iyun sa DOJ,” Aguirre said in a phone interview with “Umagang Kay Ganda.”“Mga ilang personalities po, talagang prominent personalities po na involved sa PDAF scam ang uunahin nila… Ang mga nabanggit niyang personalities noong nakaraang administrasyon ay sina Secretary Abad, parang kasama rin si Senator Trillanes, Senator De Lima at [former] Senate President Drilon.”(I have talked with her lawyer. He said, in a few days, they will file charges before the DOJ. They will prioritize several prominent personalities involved in the scam. Among those mentioned were Secretary Abad, as well as Senators Trillanes, de Lima and former Senate president Drilon.)Trillanes, for his part, denied any involvement in the scam and accused Aguirre of using his power to “persecute and harass” critics of President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration.“Aguirre has been using his office to persecute and harass members of the opposition by fabricating testimonies from dubious convicts or detainees such as the Bilibid drug lords, Kerwin Espinosa and now Napoles,” he said in a text message to ABS-CBN News.Trillanes also noted that he was never even mentioned in any of the Napoles’ list of lawmakers who abused their PDAF, which she provided during the height of the investigations in 2013.Drilon meanwhile said the allegation that he misused public funds was “a blatant lie.”“This is outright black propaganda and political harassment intended to silence the members of the opposition. If this is not revenge, I don’t know what it is,” said Drilon, a stalwart of the Liberal Party and head of the Senate minority bloc, where Trillanes and De Lima belong.However, in previous interviews, Abad denied dealing with Napoles and had said he found it “amusing” that he was being implicated in the anomaly.De Lima, meanwhile, earlier said speculated that Napoles was out to “persecute” opposition lawmakers like her.source: read more in abs-cbnCommentscomments",

I believe that opposition is a doorway to growth, di ba? Kasi kung wala namang kumukontra sa ‘yo, that just means na you’re not doing something right. So, with Duterte, he is the current president. I respect him and everything that he’s been doing,” sabi ni Gab.“Maski na there are some things na I’m not for, it doesn’t matter, e. Kasi, at the end of the day, he’s our leader and we have to respect him. And so, with everything that he’s been doing so far, I’m very, very happy. I’m very impressed,” dagdag nito.Natanong din si Gab kung may mga nais ba siyang gawin ng pangulo na para sa kanya ay magandang hakbang para sa bansa?“You know, I think that he has the most powerful and the biggest opportunity to change the Filipino mindset. And one thing na na-realize ko with the Philippines is medyo ang daming negative. And that’s the one thing I wish the Philippines would change, the negativity. Kasi siyempre, pag leader ka and you’re influential, a lot of people will follow you.”“So, my point is for Duterte, if he can be that voice of change, everybody else will follow. So, nakikita ko naman, slowly but surely he’s trying to create that change.”",

    "body": "The $1.5-trillion package to overhaul the U.S. tax system — a plan championed by Donald Trump as “a middle-class miracle” that’s polling at historically unpopular levels — is headed to the president’s desk to become law after Congress approved the reform along strict party lines.Republican legislators who pushed the most sweeping changes to the tax code in some 30 years envisioned sharp cuts to income tax rates. They also promised a new, more straightforward system — a simplification that would be so dramatic it would allow most Americans to file their tax returns on the back of a postcard.The truth is, well, more complicated.Tax policy analysts identified the winners and losers from the overhaul, and parsed how closely the new plan mirrors what congressional Republicans promised.On individual tax cutsThe good news is taxes will go down for most families, at least over the next year.About three-quarters of Americans are projected to pay less in taxes next year, while about five per cent of taxpayers will pay more, according to models by the Tax Policy Center , a non-partisan think-tank in Washington.But the good times won’t last long, said Len Burman, a former U.S. Treasury official and the co-founder of the Tax Policy Center.“All the individual tax cuts expire at the end of 2025,” he said.Taxpayers in 2026 will end up paying higher taxes than under the current law. And in 2027, Burman said, more than half of Americans will see an increase.A family of Donald Trump supporters on the campaign trail in Michigan. Tax cuts were a central plank of Trump’s successful presidential campaign and represent his first major legislative victory in office. The question is whether Americans will be pleased with the results. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)While the individual tax cuts are due to end in eight years, the corporate tax cuts will be permanent.“Advocates say don’t worry because Congress will extend all those individual tax cuts,” Burman said, but that’s an argument he has trouble buying, considering the $1.5 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years is expected to accelerate the growth of the debt from 77 per cent of gross domestic product today to about 91 per cent of GDP.“It’s a weird argument. If we couldn’t afford to extend them now with debt at 77 per cent of GDP, how will we afford to extend them in 2025?”A report last month from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a non-partisan congressional group, determined that households that earn six figures will likely pay less in taxes over the next decade. Lower- and middle-income households that make between $10,000 and $75,000 will likely end up paying more in taxes.And wealthy real estate investors like Trump get a special perk, as the bill gives real estate investors a 20 per cent tax rate.On corporate tax cutsThe tax bill lowers the corporate income tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent.That should make doing business and earning income in the U.S. more favourable than it was before, though whether large multinationals decide to relocate to the States remains to be seen.Michael Graetz, who served as a senior tax policy official in the Treasury Department during the George H.W. Bush administration, says there’s also a loophole involving so-called “pass-through businesses” that he expects will be exploited to its fullest extent by business owners.Pass-throughs are small unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S-corporations, which are taxed through their owners’ personal returns and don’t pay corporate income tax.A provision originally meant to help small businesses create jobs instead creates tax-sheltering opportunities, he said, as it allows for a deduction of 20 per cent on business income, with some limits, for pass-throughs.Graetz said savvy lawyers will likely advise their wealthy business clients to reorganize their affairs to become pass-throughs.On turbocharging the economyThe Trump plan relies on a trickle-down approach that believes less taxation on corporations will bring back American jobs and stimulate the economy.Burman’s projections show the plan would boost the economy in the short term, owing to individuals having more money to spend and businesses having more after-tax income.“But in the long run,” he said, “it’s going to be about a wash.”U.S. President Donald Trump has promised his tax bill will create ‘jobs, jobs, jobs.’ (Mike Segar/Reuters)He warned it may end up being a counterproductive approach if businesses have trouble meeting demand, leading to inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates, and in turn making it harder for consumers to afford big-ticket items like cars and homes.“So there’s certainly a risk that if interest rates responded significantly, the net effect could be negative,” he said. “This pro-growth tax plan could make the economy weaker than it would have been without it.”At a news conference Wednesday, Trump promised that passage of the tax plan “means jobs. Jobs, jobs jobs.”That, too, is a tough sell for Burman. He said the new plan is a shift to a “territorial” tax system. That means businesses would only be taxed on income earned inside the country. Most future foreign profits would be exempt.It’s meant to discourage companies from parking profits in tax havens and to reinvest at home. But Burman said it could actually end up pushing multinationals to move operations overseas.“This is supposed to bring jobs home, and it could have the exact opposite effect,” he said.On tax simplificationThere’s nothing new in politicians overpromising and under-delivering. But Graetz said the dream that most Americans’ tax returns will be so simple they could file them on a postcard remains out of reach.“It just doesn’t match up with the rhetoric,” he said.‘There are lots of opportunities in this legislation for tax breaks that were probably unintended.’ – Michael Graetz, former senior tax policy official in the Treasury DepartmentHe acknowledged that some people who currently take the standard deduction will have simpler tax filing.But the short answer to the postcard scenario is that the people who could soon, in theory, fill out taxes on a postcard under this new law could have done so previously anyway.Obvious winners, Graetz said, will be lawyers and accountants who will be navigating new and complex international tax provisions and informing people about how to reorganize their business affairs.“There are lots of opportunities in this legislation for tax breaks that were probably unintended,” Graetz said. “So the accountants and lawyers are certainly going to have a lot of time to work on this.”On ObamacareAn estimated 13 million fewer people will have health insurance, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.The tax bill repeals the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans have health insurance. The individual mandate includes a financial penalty for those lacking coverage, and is meant to ensure healthy Americans enrol, which helps to prop up the marketplace and offset the cost of covering people who are less healthy.The tax bill repeals the so-called individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Millions more Americans are expected to go without health insurance as a result. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)By scrapping the mandate, premiums could rise as those most likely to drop their coverage will be the healthiest individuals who don’t believe it’s of much worth to them, Burman said.“There are a bunch of people who would probably be worse off as a result, but don’t know it,” he said.Another concern, he said, is that those opting not to get health insurance might be people who could have discovered once they went to the Obamacare exchanges that they qualified for Medicaid, which is free health insurance for lower-income individuals.Obamacare advocates believe the mandate is a helpful nudge that encourages people who might at first be reluctant to consider health insurance due to the cost to realize that getting coverage is ultimately in their bests interest.“When people go to one of the [Obamacare] exchanges, and they’re told they’re eligible for free health insurance, presumably they’re pretty happy about that,” Burman said. “Without the mandate, a lot of people who become eligible for Medicaid wouldn’t be able to find out.”",

Based on the United Nations – World Drug Report in 2013, the Philippines has the highest abuse rate for methamphetamine hydrochloride, or shabu, in East Asia.The UN report was cited by the US Department of State in its 2012 International Drug Control Strategy Report, which is posted on the website of the US Embassy in Manila. The state department also disclosed that 2.1 percent of Filipinos aged 16 to 64 were using shabu, and “domestic consumption of methamphetamine and marijuana continued to be the main drug threats in the Philippines.”In 2012, the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) reported that there were approximately 1.3 million drug user.More than 8,000 barangays in the country are plagued with the drug menace, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) said. Metro Manila has the highest rate of being drug-affected with 92.10 percent of the region’s barangays affected, followed by Region 4A (Southern Tagalog) at 33.78 percent.Based on its consolidated data gathered from operational reports and other law enforcement agencies, the PDEA said around 20.51 percent or 8,629 villages out of the 42,065 barangays nationwide have drug-related cases.Curiously, no other DDB study has been made since then.excerpt from: http://aboutstuff-stuff.blogspot.co.il/2016/05/pdea-leader-stopped-arrest-of-drug.htmlCommentscomments",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Monday, August 29th, 2016Manila, Philippines – Tough-talking President Rodrigo Duterte commented in an interview yesterday regarding plans on what to do with the bodies of drug lords and drug pushers who have been executed for their crimes: he will sell them to fertilizer companies, grind the bodies to be mixed with compost to serve as fertilizer on government grounds and parks.Duterte said that these criminals deserve to meet that fate even in death, as notice to others who are involved in the drug trade. This is a message to everyone that he is serious in stamping out crime — especially the drug problem that has been plaguing the country for many decades.He also said that his people have contacted several fertilizer companies and are “excited” to offer their services for “the betterment” of the country.“We’ve contacted, I think four or five companies and proposed the idea, sabi nila, gusto nila tumulong at excited sila sa idea,” said Duterte.“Sama-sama na sila sa tae at mga bulok na bagay, p***ng ina nila,” he adds.We have contacted several fertilizer companies operating in the Philippines. Several have declined to comment, however, a representative from Crown Elifax, based in Pasay confirmed that they have already purchased several chipping machines from the United States to serve as grinding machines for the cadavers.The representative, who only agreed to comment if his name was withheld, said that the machines are used to grind trees into chips to be used as ground cover. To explain this, he suggested that we find a video clip from the 1996 Hollywood movie, “Fargo”.We did some research and this is what we found below.",

    "body": "In that article, I explained the steps involved in the processing an ethics complaint, namely:In seven-person Ethics Committee, I predicted that the Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will almost certainly vote for the complaint, so the vote of either Honasan or Poe is necessary.In the 22-person plenary, meanwhile, I predicted twelve “yes” senator-voters, namely: (1) Pimentel, (2) Ejercito, (3) Zubiri, (4) Pacquiao, (5) Sotto, (6) Lacson, (7) Honasan, (8) Villar, (9) Binay, (10) Angara, (11) Gordon, and (12) Legarda.I also predicted the five “no” senator-voters, namely: (1) Aquino the Ninoy Cosplayer, (2) Pangilinan-Cuneta, (3) Drilon, (4) Hontiveros, and (5) Trillanes.With this, I explained that it would be necessary for three of the remaining five “maybes” – (1) Gatchalian, (2) Villanueva, (3) Recto, (4) Poe, and (5) Escudero – to vote for the complaint if the Trillanes is to be expelled.Discovery No. 1: Trillanes will be forced to inhibitSotto Lacson Pacquiao Honasan Poe Hontiveros TrillanesDiscovery # 2: Trillanes may move to exclude Gordon from votingDiscovery # 3: A not-so-solid Liberal PartyDiscovery # 4: Escudero likely to vote “No”.The remaining “maybes” are Poe, Escudero, Gatchalian.Discovery # 5: Gatchalian’s and Poe's respective predicaments.The remaining “maybes” are Poe and Gatchalian and we still need one more vote to expel Trillanes from the senate.Discovery #6: Duterte will call KokoNow, let’s recall that we have 13 “expel” votes so far, and we need one more vote from either Gatchalian or Poe.“This Trillanes (is a) political ISIS. He has no talent. He will not… he does not even know (the difference) between a democrat and a member of a party. How can I expect (him to know)? He lacks… what he knows in life is not enough.”DLSU Political Science professor Antonio Contreras informed me today that the “defendant” in an ethics complaint is not allowed to vote on it, and this totally changes the ballgame.Let’s recall the members of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges:Trillanes is a part of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges. If he will not be allowed to vote, then the total number of members is six. Like what I’ve explained in the previous article, Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will almost certainly vote in favor of the complaint. Thus, even if Honasan, Poe, and Hontiveros vote to dismiss the complaint, the tally will still be 3-3.The committee chairman – in this case Sotto – usually provides the tie-breaker vote, but owing to the sensitivity of the issue, my senate insider-friends and I predict that Sotto will push for the convening of the “Committee of the Whole”, similar to what happened in 2010 when then Senator Maria Ana Consuelo “Jamby” Madrigal filed an ethics complaint against then Senator Manuel “Manny” Villar, Jr., over the C-5 controversy [ Senate ].The “Committee of the Whole” rule refers to the whole membership of a legislative house, in this case the Senate, sitting as a committee and operating under informal rules [ MW ]. Thus, even a 3-3 tie vote will result in a de facto endorsement to the Senate Plenary, as the members of the “Committee of the Whole” and the members of the Senate Plenary are, pretty much, one and the same.In short, Trillanes’ forcible inhibition inevitably results into a endorsement of Gordon’s ethics complaint to the Plenary.Now, Trillanes will also inhibit from voting at the “Committee of the Whole”, so the total number of voter-senators will thus be 21.But wait, there’s more!As the defendant, Trillanes may file a motion to exclude the complainant Gordon. Gordon may accede to Trillanes motion, although this will still be subject to voting by the Committee of the Whole. Thus, we are left with two scenarios: (A) Gordon votes, and (B) Gordon inhibits.If Gordon votes, the total number of senator-voters in the plenary will be 21, so that the required two-thirds majority vote to expel Trillanes is 14. If Gordon inhibits, the total number of senator-voters in the plenary will be 20, and two-thirds will still be 14.Truth be told, I believe it won’t matter much because Trillanes has made so many enemies in the Senate, it won’t be too difficult to find someone who’ll vote against him.Let me explain further.Let’s exclude Gordon and assume that only 11 will surely vote to expel Trillanes, so we need three more for 15 votes (2/3 majority), as only 20 will be voting on the ethics complaint.As you may recall, four (4) senators – (1) Aquino the Ninoy Cosplayer, (2) Pangilinan-Cuneta, (3) Hontiveros the Kidnapper , and (4) Drilon – have already issued a statement in support of Trillanes [ Star ]. All these four Senators are from the Liberal Party (LP). Well, Hontiveros is Akbayan, but we all know that Akbayan is “LP Lite”.Interestingly, the other two LP senators – Villanueva and Recto – did not sign the statement, and for good reason. Villanueva is technically from CIBAC but he ran under the LP ticket.Senate insiders told me that both Recto and Villanueva strongly dislike Trillanes and they will almost certainly vote against the coup plotter. For one, my senate sources told me that both have less than rosy words to say about Trillanes when speaking about the latter in the senate corridors.Yes, my senate sources are very confident that the two will vote against Trillanes, bringing the total of “yes” votes to 13.One more.Let’s face it: Escudero is a TraPo (traditional politician) in every sense of the word. He looks like one, talks like one, and acts like one. Despite that, Escudero, unlike Hontiveros, is not stupid. He is an astute politician, in the sense that he knows how to play “survival politics”.In that case, I am confident that he will vote “no” because of the prospective Andy Bautista impeachment case.In “ Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt ”, I explained that Escudero may be convinced to acquit embattled Comelec chair Andres Bautista, because Bautista’s removal may uncover Escudero’s reported maneuverings during the 2016 National Elections.According to my sources, Escudero gave the Comelec the go-signal to transfer votes for him to VP Leni Robredo, allowing the latter to overtake Bongbong Marcos by a hair's breadth [ FB ].Thus so far, we have 13 “expel” votes and 5 “retain” votes.Gatchalian has a pending graft case at the Sandiganbayan, as I’ve explained in a previous article . Thus, it may be in his political interest to side with Duterte, since that case will probably reach the Supreme Court. By the time it does, Duterte would have appointed at least ten SC associate justices [ TP: SC Math ] or even eleven, as Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno may be removed as her impeachment case gains major traction in the Lower House [ Star ].Poe, on the other hand, is part of Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel’s majority bloc. Poe’s term ends in 2019, and I am confident that she’s gunning for re-election. Even if she votes in favor of Trillanes (or abstains, which essentially has the same effect), she may still win in 2019.The problem, however, is whether that prospective 2019 senatorial win, despite being a win, may still turn out to be an embarrassment. Recall the Poe was on top of the senatorial winners in the 2013 elections. Her placing anywhere lower than 3rd will be politically humiliating because it will imply that the populace isn’t as confident in her as before. And I think this will happen if she doesn’t vote to expel Antonio, who is probably the most hated public figure right now, except possibly for… No, Trillanes really is the most hated today.Absolving Trillanes will also be disastrous for her long-term political ambitions. Remember that she ran for president in 2016 and lost, but the general consensus back then was that she’s still too young and inexperienced for the presidency. To be fair, many of those who didn’t vote for her, and even some who did, felt that she has better chances if she runs in 2022.But if she absolves Trillanes, she might as well kiss those dreams goodbye.Harsh? Yes, but true.President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly said that he doesn’t meddle with the affairs of the legislature. But I have reason to believe that this is just lip service. Duterte isn’t stupid: he will use backdoor channels to get things done.We all know that Duterte has publicly displayed his dislike of Trillanes, with him even announcing that he’d advise his son, Davao City vice-mayor Paolo Duterte, to remain silent at the senate hearings [ CNN ].Earlier today, Duterte even likened Trillanes to a terrorist group when he said in a mix of Cebuano and Tagalog [ Inq ]:The list goes on and on but what’s clear is that, if given the option, Duterte would probably rather have Trillanes become a private citizen.",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines — Noche Buena for Filipinos is not just about the delightful dishes served on the table, but also about the actual preparation and celebration. And in the meaningful spirit of Christmas, families are brought together — wherever they may be in the globe.This is true for Vanjo Merano, the writer behind food blog Panlasang Pinoy. Now based in Chicago, he and his family still celebrate Noche Buena the Filipino way, serving and surrounding themselves with flavors and memories back home.“Noche Buena is all about family, loved ones and good food perfect for the special occasion,” he says.With this in mind, he picks two recipes — both meaty classics— for fellow Pinoys to cook and share together. These are Pork Kaldereta and Chicken Embudito, which for him make the occasion even more special and festive.The season’s colors in Pork KalderetaFestive to both the eyes and palate, Merano began cooking his Special Pork Kalderata when the family was still in the Philippines. Since then, it has been a Noche Buena mainstay in the Merano household.He makes it special by adding Manzanilla olives and cheese. “The olives provide a bit of sour and salty taste, while the cheese gives it a bit of richness. These ingredients complimentthe dish and makeit taste even better,” he shares.Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:He also prefers pork shoulder that contains fat, the secret to moist meat. He further advises to cook the meat until it gets very tender for “a more pleasurable experience.”How do you achieve this? “This can be done by cooking the meat in low heat for 40 minutes to 1 hour (or so) depending on the quality of the meat,” he answers.One last ingredient — but definitely not the least — is added: the Knorr Pork Cubes, which according to Merano, bring out the real, meaty flavors of the pork. The result is an even meatier and tastier dish that will surely be a pleasant surprise.“Special Pork Kaldereta represents the colors of the season and it is simply delicious,” says Merano.Chicken Embutido made colorfulAnother dish that Merano would love Filipinos to cook for Noche Buena is the Chicken Embutido, our local meatloaf. The reason behind this is that meatloaf is associated with the holidays and it can be made more colorful.“It might look intimidating to prepare, but I am telling you that it is easy and quick,” he assures.Begin by preparing the ingredients that include ground chicken, bread crumbs, sweet relish, cheese, raisins, salt and pepper, and (raw and hard-boiled) eggs. Don’t forget the Knorr Chicken Cubes so that the chicken flavor stands out from the myriad of ingredients. The addition of this secret ingredient is sure to make the embutido more mouth-watering.Then mince the following: red bell pepper, green bell pepper and yellow onion to give embutido lots of colors! Merano advises everyone in the family to give a helping hand in the preparation of the ingredients.The next step is the easiest — mixing everything! He explains, “Combine the ingredients in a bowl (except for boiled eggs) and folded everything until well blended. Once the chicken embutido mixture is ready, I started wrapping it in foil. The boiled eggs that were sliced into wedges (or quartered) were placed in the middle of the mixture. It helps make the dish look pretty later on.”Once ready, steam the embutido for an hour and serve it warm, fried or chilled, depending on the family’s preference.‘ChristMAS Masarap’ with KnorrPanlasang Pinoy generously shares the recipes of his meaty Noche Buena dishes.

He only wanted to improve his nose line but it ballooned up instead.Neil Stephen Asunto shares on his Facebook account how he paid only 20 pesos (.39 cents) to a shady person that he didn't even know the name, to do a supposed enhancement procedure on his nose. He said that he wanted to look like South Korean star Lee Min Ho with sharp nose but instead of edges, he got a big rounded and awkward looking one in the middle of his face.He said that it was baking soda and petroleum jelly the anonymous 'surgeon injected' into to his nose. Perhaps his better judgement was clouded by his desire to look even better by that time, he did not find the surgeon and the procedure itself suspicious.Asunto also recounts on his social media posts that he often gets bullied by other people because of his now ruined nose but he is still holding up good and is optimistic that his nose can still be fixed.Here's the full text of Asunto's post:Although this story may offer a lesson of two for others to learn we must look at it with curious eyes. Stories like this proliferate the internet long before you stopped wearing baby bra. And more often than not such stories like thisare just hoaxes made for fun or otherwise.",

Pilipinas International Mariel De Leon,, narito ang mga opinion at bwelta ng mga netizens:His father, Christopher De Leon , was a DRUG ADDICT and very UNPROFESSIONAL. Ask Dina Bonnevie and she will share her experience with him.Her mother, Sandy Andolong, was just a STARLET. She wasn’t respected artist in the industry of showbiz. She didn’t do any memorable movie.Her cousin, the son of Pinky De Leon, is a convicted man involved in Visconde Massacre and rape. How is that for a background?Except for having a sexy image, Mocha doesn’t have those involvement in drugs, rape, homicide, etc. Mariel should be ashamed for carrying those baggage.Nowadays, when Mariel guests in show, she would be asked to sing opera. She would gladly give the audience a sample of her talent. I can say she is NOT EXCELLENT Opera singer. She is just a mediocre. No wonder she didn’t win the BEST IN TALENT.Regarding intelligence, remember she was asked, “What field do women excel more than men?” Mariel answered “In boxing. Because I box better than men.”Really? How many women are there in boxing? Is there any woman better than Pacquiao, Mayweather, Tyson, Ali, etc?Should we talk and analyze further about your intelligence? Even your physical beauty should be questioned. How much RETOKE? Remember we saw you in 2013 and, boy, you look different.Hindi masama ang isang opinion depende kapag destructive or constructive…@mariaangelicadl U r not as “respectful” as you think u r.

    "body": "Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan is not convinced with the report from the Philippine National Police on what happened during the bloody PNP-CIDG drug raid in Ozamiz City last Sunday.The President of the Liberal Party is suspicious about the timing of the raid that resulted in the huge death toll from the suspected drug suspects including Ozamiz Mayor Parojinog Sr. and a board member from Parojinog family.He questioned why the raiding team issued an arrest warrant at past 2 a.m as well as the disabling of the close circuit television cameras (CCTV) during the anti-drug operation against the Parojinog family.Pangilinan also became more suspicious when he knew that no one from the side of the raiding team got hurt or killed during the dangerous operation despite of the police report that the bodyguards of the Parojinog family were heavily armed.The senator said that the report from the raiding team is ‘unrealistic’.Pangilinan also worried that what the raiding team led by Ozamiz PNP chief Jovie Espinido can be also done to other people.“Hinatid ang warrant of arrest nang pasado alas dos ng madaling araw. Pinatay ang CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras bago pasukin ang bahay. Lahat ng 15 pinaghihinalaang mga drug lord at ang kanilang ‘armadong-armadong’ mga bodyguard ay nasa pinangyarihan ng krimen at pinatay. Walang mga sugatan o nasawi sa panig ng PNP. Hindi makatotohanan. Pwedeng gawin ito kaninuman.” He said.The bloody raid conducted by the members of PNP and CIDG resulted to the death of 15 people including the Mayor and Board member of Ozamiz City.They also arrested Vice Mayor Nova Parojinog Echavez and Councilor Reynaldo Parojinog Jr who’s being transferred to Camp Crame in Manila for inquest proceedings.According to the police report, when the serving officer entered the compound of the Parojinog family, the bodyguard of Mayor Aldong opened fire that made the authorities to retaliate.Chief Espinido also explained that the reason why they turned off the CCTV cameras was to protect the police officers during the operation.Philippine National Police Director General chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa also defended the timing of the serving warrant to the Parojinogs, saying that authorities can issue a warrant of arrest anytime.Because of the death of Mayor Aldong Parojinog and the arrest of Vice Mayor Nova Parojinog, the councilors of Ozamiz appointed to lead the City temporarily.Bato said that the death of the most powerful politician in Ozamiz is a warning to the other narco politicians who still not surrendering to the governement.",

Viewer discretion is advised.]A shocking scene roused the people of Malilipot, Albay after authorities discovered a 12-year-old girl who was assaulted and left unconscious in a private area at Brgy. Basud yesterday.Aside from the extreme beatings, the victim was found missing her underwear, leading the police to believe that she was also possibly raped. Having found her still alive despite her critical state, emergency responders rushed the girl to the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital.It was known that the youngster was supposed to attend evening mass or “simbang gabi”. According to the victim’s mother, her daughter left the house at 3:30AM.Initial police investigation reports that the 12-year-old girl may have been gang-r*ped as she made her way to the church. Further investigation is also currently underway.Authorities reminded other parents to be wary of the dangers waiting for their children if they let them out alone late at night.Meanwhile, a concerned netizen named Osang Borres spread the word on Facebook. Netizens were nothing but concerned about the 12-year-old girl. Here are some of their comments:“grade 6 poe2 so ni rape.comatose po so aki” “sana makarecover ang bktima ngane maituro nya ang nagibo kaan saiya grabe na talaga panahon ngunyan” “ “Sabi kung si Duterte na angPangulo mababawasan ang krmen saPinas garo lalong lumala ang ang kremen.” “Katakot nmn jan” “Naway gumaling ka kaagad ining at mabigayn ng hustisya ang gumawa sayo nyan” “grabe n mn ang nangyayari dito [sic] ,,bati papalapit na ang pasko [sic] ..mga walang hiya,mga hay*p!!

(Jorge Cabrera/Reuters)Nasralla, who was in Washington to rally international support, said he would file a new formal appeal of the results and was encouraged by the reaction of the U.S. government, which issued a statement Monday urging parties unhappy with the vote to take advantage of a five-day period to appeal it.But Honduras Vice-President Ricardo Alvarez insisted on Monday there would be no do-over.The election began in controversy over the mere fact Hernandez was seeking re-election. The country’s constitution explicitly bans it and another former president — now leader of Nasralla’s coalition — was ousted from office by the army, legislature and courts just for allegedly considering it.But a pro-Hernandez Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the ban violated his rights, paving the way for him to run.",

I hope you will find the maturity to focus on more alerting issues and not on a 17 year old girl. Try to be uselful.” Isabelle Duterte tweeted Photo: twitter.com/isabelleduterteIsabelle, who’s turning 18 on January 26, received criticisms from several netizens who were annoyed by her pre-debut photo shoot inside Malacañang Palace.Her photos were featured by several media outlets and quickly became the topic of the week.The critics cited that she violated the Executive Order signed by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2004 which ‘prescribing the design and use of the coat-of-arms, seal, and flag of the President and Vice President of the Philippines, and for other purposes’According to the section 3 of the E.O: “Permitted and Prohibited Uses of the Heraldic Symbols of the President and the Vice President of the Philippines. Except as otherwise provided by law or Presidential issuance, the Coat-of-Arms, Seal, and Flag of the President of the Philippines or of the Vice President of the Philippines shall be exclusively used to represent the President of the Philippines or the Vice President of the Philippines, respectively.”Several netizens even attacked the personal Facebook account of Isabelle who shared the photo of the silver wedding anniversary of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and former President Ferdinand Marcos.But, it seems that Isabelle didn’t choose to delete the hate comments on her Facebook.According to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, the members of the presidential family are entitled to have their pictures ‘taken’ inside the Palace.“Sa ’kin, wala namang masama doon. Nag-pose lang for birthday pictures yung apo ni Presidente sa Malacañang,” Roque said.“I don’t think it should be an issue. Kasi dapat nga nakatira sila sa Malacañang. Hindi naman sila tumitira sa Malacañang so gaya sila ng ordinaryong mamamayan na pwede ring magpicture-picture sa Malacañang,” he added.“Huwag na po nating ipagkait yung photo opportunity sa loob ng Palasyo,” Roque said.Meanwhile several bloggers and netizens who supported President Duterte said that they believed that the supporters of the former Aquino administration wanted the people to focus on Isabelle Duterte so the public would forget the more alarming issue like ‘Dengvaxia controversy’.Source: Philstar",

    "body": "The Liberal government has launched a $1-billion project to rehabilitate the crumbling Supreme Court building, though key systems are at risk of failure long before any repairs begin.A water-damaged section of the parking garage roof could collapse by the end of next year, and mechanical and electrical systems are predicted to fail by 2020 and 2021, says an internal document obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act.But the heritage building, officially opened in 1939, is not slated for rehabilitation until 2023, partly because the high-court offices and chambers must be relocated to a building across the street that also needs extensive rehabilitation.The West Memorial Building, vacant since 2008, will become the temporary home for the Supreme Court. (CBC)Officials at the department in charge of the work, Public Services and Procurement Canada, are “closely monitoring the building for potential failures,” spokesperson Nicolas Boucher said Wednesday.“As an example, the parking garage is inspected regularly and mitigating measures can be implemented should a need arise.”Spokespersons for the Supreme Court referred all questions back to Public Services.Temporary chambersThe project’s estimated $1-billion price tag includes a massive overhaul of a nearby building on Wellington Street, the West Memorial Building, which will be a temporary home for the high court chamber and justices’ offices while the Supreme Court building gets its five-year makeover through to 2028.Public Services awarded the first big contract for the project last week, to PCL Constructors Canada Ltd., for $6.2 million. The Nepean, Ont., firm will do demolition work and roof replacement at the West Memorial Building over the next year. (The contract requires “zero activity visible” on Wellington Street until Aug. 31, out of respect for Canada 150 celebrations.)Boucher said an architect is expected to be hired to design temporary chambers for the Supreme Court and the Federal Court somewhere inside the West Memorial Building.The West Block on Parliament Hill is nearing the end of an $863-million rehabilitation, which includes the creation of a temporary House of Commons in the courtyard. (Catherine Lanthier/Radio-Canada)The original Supreme Court building, almost 80 years old, is slated for steel-frame reinforcement to make it more earthquake resistant, as have all refurbished Parliament Hill buildings, because Ottawa is in an active earthquake zone.Heating, air-conditioning, electrical, plumbing and other systems will be replaced entirely, and the building wired for internet and other modern information technology systems.The parking garage will be repaired, and the escarpment at the back of the property, running down steeply to the Ottawa River, will be stabilized, Boucher said.Other projectsThe $1-billion project joins other expensive rehabs in and around Parliament Hill, including:The $863-million project to update the West Block, on Parliament Hill, where the House of Commons will meet starting in fall next year as the Centre Block gets a 10-year rehabilitation, beginning 2019. The West Block work included the removal of 2,400 tonnes of asbestos.The $425-million Wellington Building rehabilitation, a project nearly complete, fitted out with new offices and committee rooms for parliamentarians.The $460-million, three-year Bank of Canada renovation project, now nearing completion.The $219-million renovation of the Government Conference Centre, which includes a new Senate chamber that will operate while the Centre Block, which houses the Senate, is refurbished.At least $81 million for repairs so far to the East Block on Parliament Hill, with more work to come.The $100-million rehabilitation of the Sir John A. Macdonald Building on Wellington Street, formerly a Bank of Montreal branch, now complete.The $136-million rehabilitation of the Library of Parliament, completed in 2006.The Centre Block will get a major facelift, including the possible digging of a basement, starting in 2019 when “many of its major systems and components will be at risk of critical failure … with total failure predicted by 2025,” according to Public Services. The price tag has not been announced but is expected to be as much as $1 billion over 10 years.Public Services has said the total budget for the Parliamentary Precinct repairs is over $3 billion, but did not include the Supreme Court building or the Centre Block in the estimate.Follow @DeanBeeby on Twitter",

    "body": "Davao City Mayor and Presidential daughter Sara Duterte exposed on Thursday the alleged presidential ambitions of three senators who are part of the group “Tindig Pilipinas,” which she mocked as “Hunger Games Pilipinas.”“Lahat ito hindi chismis kasi personal knowledge ko at may corroborative witnesses ako. Matanong ko lang, nu’ng mga panahon na humingi kayo ng tulong, may isyu ba kayo sa governance ni PRD (President Rodrigo Duterte)? Wala,” Sara said in a Facebook post.(These are not rumors because I have personal knowledge and corroborative witnesses. If I may just ask, during your time of need, did you have any issue with the PRD’s governance? None.)“Ngayon na nanalo na siya? Meron. Hunger Games, Pilipinas: Plastic na, oportunista pa. Kayo 3 may ambisyon mag-Presidente, I grew up in politics, mas matagal pa ako sa pulitika kesa sa inyo 3 combined. I smell ambition a million miles away. Akala ninyo ‘yung circus ninyo ngayon magpapanalo sa inyo sa 2022? Hindi,” she added.(Now that he has won, you have. Hunger Games, Pilipinas: A group of plastic, opportunistic people. You three have presidential ambitions. I grew up in politics, and was in politics longer than the three of you combined. I smell ambition a million miles away. You think your circus will make you win in 2022? No.)The presidential daughter was referring to Senators Francis “Kiko” Panglinan, Risa Hontiveros, and Antonio Trillanes IV.Sara claimed that Pangilinan met her years ago to get her father’s endorsement.“Kiko Pangilinan- Several years ago nagkita tayo dito sa Davao, sa isang golf club, pinuntuhan mo si PRD. Gusto mo tumakbo Presidente, ansabe mo? ‘With Sharon’s [endorsement] and your (PRD) [endorsement] I’m sure I can make it.’ Dati pa-[endorse] ka sa kanya ngayon may pa Hunger Games salute effect ka,” Sara said.(Kiko Pangilinan—several years ago, we met at a golf club here in Davao when you met with PRD. You wanted to run for President, right? You said that with Sharon’s endorsement, and with PRD’s endorsement, you were sure you would make it. Before, you sought his endorsement, now you have younger Hunger Games salute.)She also said Hontiveros sought her help during her campaign.“Risa Hontiveros – Sa picture ikaw ang pinaka makapal ang foundation acheng. Habang tinutulungan ko si PRD at ang nanay ko mangampanya, nasa byaheng du30 ako, ilang beses mo ako inabala, kinulit at tinawagan para humingi ka ng tulong sa boto mo sa Davao City? I can remember your bored face listening to me in our law office just so you can get support for Davao,” Sara said.(Risa Hontiveros- In pictures, you have the thickest foundation. While I and my mother were helping PRD campaign, how many times did you approach me, bother me and call me so I would help you get votes in Davao City? I can remember your bored face listening to me in our law office just so you can get support for Davao.)The Davao mayor said that aside from the two, Trillanes requested for President Rodrigo Duterte’s help in his campaign as vice president.“Trillanes – Years ago, nagrequest ka makipag kita sa akin dito sa Davao,nasa Damosa ka, ano sabi ko sa emissary mo? No. You know why? I never liked your circus sa Manila Peninsula. Pero meron ako picture na nakipagkita ka kay PRD kasi humingi ka ng tulong niya sa VP campaign mo,” she said.Sara, meanwhile, said she would reserve her remarks on Vice President Leni Robredo since she said the latter claimed she was not part of the “Hunger Games Pilipinas” anyway.(Trillanes—years ago, you requested to meet me in Davao while you were in Damoso. What did I tell your emissary? No. You know why? I never liked your circus sa Manila Peninsula. But I have a picture of your meeting with PRD because you sought his help for your VP run.)Sara also slammed as “Paninindigang Trapo” the criticisms the three senators hurled against Duterte.“Mamuyboy ko? Yes. You don’t use PRD whenever convenient para sa pulitika ninyo (for your political ambitions). Kung wala ang boto ng Mindanao, mananalo kaya kayo (If you did not have Mindanao’s vote, would you win)?” the mayor added.",

    "body": "There are a few third world countries where a young girl’s safety is questionable in more rural areas – thanks in part to their outdated ways of thinking. Often these countries have a very narrow view when it comes to women and children. This could lead to a lot of dangerous situations for young girls, who simply wish to live their lives the way they see fit. Back in 2005, a young girl was kidnapped by a group of men in Ethiopia.The young girl was abducted and beaten by these men because they wanted to force her into a marriage. She was taken to an isolated place but what the men didn’t realize was that they weren’t alone. There were three unlikely heroes that watched the whole thing. Three lions were in the area where the kidnappers took the young girl.The fierce animals scared off the men and actually protected the little girl. Police found the victim one week after she was declared missing. When the authorities found her, they couldn’t believe the sight that greeted them. A little girl surrounded by three lions who didn’t look interested in eating her but were actually protecting her. When the police came, it was like the animals knew that she was finally safe so they left and went back to the forest.“They stood guard until we found her and then they just left her like a gift and went back into the forest,” Sgt. Wondimu Wedajo of the police said.These lions saved her life because usually when kidnappings like these would happen, the men would severely r*pe and beat the victim they take. So if the lions hadn’t scared the men off, then this would have been the likely scenario.People were astonished to note that these wild lions did not harm or eat the girl since they are carnivorous predators.Wildlife expert Stuart Williams has a theory for that: “A young girl whimpering could be mistaken for the mewing sound from a lion cub, which in turn could explain why they didn’t eat her.”According to a report by NBC News, authorities had apprehended four of the abductors while three were still at large.Here are some of the netizens’ comments on the story:What can you say about the story? Do you think she would have died if the lions did not come in and scared off the men? Why do you think she stayed alive for a half day more despite being surrounded by carnivorous animals?

    "body": "The Philippines has always been looking for effective leaders that will change how Filipino people live for the better. We have heard numerous cries for the ousting of corrupt politicians and the breaking of ineffective and profit-driven systems. Maybe this led to President Rodrigo Duterte stating that he now wants someone from the masses to lead a governmental position.He expressed his desire to place 2009’s CNN Hero of the Year Efren Peñaflorida in the position as the head of the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor. The country’s leaders have fired the commission’s top leaders after alleged claims of “misdeeds.”The president gave a speech during the Christmas party for the Davao media held at the presidential guest house there. He said:“Bigyan mo ako ng tao na galing sa hirap o mahirap, na marunong at i-appoint ko na chairman. Ang una kong i-consider ‘yung nagatulak bitaw, gawin kong chairman ‘yon.“Now he looks to the humble man who started an inspiring movement towards education using a wooden pushcart. Efren beat out nine other contenders for the CNN award when he gained the most number of online votes. But apart from him, President Duterte also looks to five farmers from Davao to head the commission.Duterte decided to sack Terry Ridon, the commission’s former chairman, for “failing to convene the commission as a collegial body and for attending unnecessary junkets.” The president felt like Ridon attended too many social events and seminars for his position.“I appointed him September. He has traveled 8 times (to) every gathering, conventions, seminar outside. And to think he was representing the urban poor. Kaya pinalayas ko lahat, wala akong tinira.“Ridon is known for his association with the Left and was confident that the commission, under his leadership, “had implemented with full integrity the presidential promise of no demolition without relocation.”What can you say about the president’s plans for the government? Do you think that Efren Peñaflorida is a good choice for the position? Share your thoughts, reactions, and opinions in the comments section below!",

Arroyo said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown awesome leadership and resolve in the many programs that he promised to do during his presidency.”“In his first year, he managed to institute various bold reforms against illegal drugs and corruption. His Build, Build, Build initiative is commendable and is a step in the right direction towards achieving inclusive growth.”Arroyo’s government was marred by numerous controversies in regard to electoral cheating and alleged cases of corruption. However, that did not stop her from once again being voted into a position of power. For the former president, President Duterte managed to inspire and unite the Filipino people. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo stated:“More than his accomplishments in his work as President, President Duterte has achieved to inspire and unite the Filipino people towards his goal of effecting real change for the country. I wish him success and the best of health for the rest of his term as he fulfills his mandate for the nation and for the people.”Shortly after winning the presidential election, Duterte began to develop a close relationship with former president Arroyo. He also appointed many of her former subordinates to office and occasionally seeks her counsel. He also often invites her to official gatherings.Meanwhile, Former Senator Bongbong Marcos, Jr., a known ally of the president, also lauded Duterte for being a “good leader” and establishing an “important position” of the country in the international community. He said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown one singular quality that is very clear and the reason why he is very popular–the quality of leadership. For example, he has redirected our foreign policy and that is the reason why we have regained once again a crucial and important position in the international community to the benefit of the Philippines. It is the same with various domestic policies.”The former senator also said that Filipinos recognize the president’s efforts. Bongbong stated:“Only a good leader can do that and he managed to do just that.”",

Despite apologizing for what she has done, she is still facing charges filed against him by Mr. Doctor. But while everyone who saw the video is mad at her, Senator Risa Hontiveros is willing to help her file cyberbullying cases against her bashers.“Naiintinidihan naman natin si Mang Virgilio, at hindi natin kinakampihan si Ms. Interior. Kaso sobra naman ang ilan sa atin kung makapag-bash. Mayroon pang nananakot na rerepyin sya at sasaktan siya pag nakita nila siya. Hindi naman tama yun. Nag-sorry na at handa naman daw niyang harapin yung kaso. Ano pa ba ang gusto nila?” Sen. Hontiveros told reporters on Tuesday, December 19.(We understand the situation of Mang Virgilio, and I’m not siding with Ms. Interior. However, some of her bashers are already going beyond the line. They are threatening her, saying that they will rape and hurt her if they see her. That is not right, anymore. She already apologized, and she’s willing to face the case. What else do they want?)According to Sen. Hontiveros, her office is willing to help anyone who has been a victim of cyberbullying, and that it includes those who have offended others. It can be recalled that in November 2016, the Akbayan senator filed the so-called “Tres Marias” bills, which seek to give women more protection against sexual harassment and violence, including attacks on social media.Must Read: * Woman Driver Who Slapped Taxi Driver Apologizes, Taxi Driver Files CaseHontiveros, who chairs the Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality, added that Ms. Interior contacted her office and asked for help. The Liberal Party (LP) ally senator said that the latter is now suffering from extreme trauma. And despite the fact that Cherish Sharmaine has already deactivated her Facebook account, some netizens created fake Facebook accounts of her, causing her to still receive threats.Last Monday, Virgilio Doctor said that Ms. Interior probably got mad at him when he honked at her and overtake her. According to him, he just did it because an FX behind him also did to him. The 52-year old taxi driver added that he already apologized to the woman, but still she went on cursing at him, and eventually slapped him. For this reason, he filed physical injury and damage to property cases against her.source: GMACommentscomments",

Wearing a black skullcap, he paused in front of the holiest site where Jews can pray, then placed what appeared to be a written prayer or note between its stones, as is custom.SPONSORTrump was not accompanied by any Israeli leaders during the hugely symbolic visit.Allowing them to do so could have led to accusations that Washington was implicitly recognizing Israel's unilateral claim of sovereignty over the site, which would break with years of US and international precedent.Security was tight, with the usually bustling Old City, where the Western Wall is located, essentially on lockdown and the plaza leading to the site cleared.As Trump's convoy of dozens of cars entered the square around 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), armed security forces were positioned on nearly every building nearby as well as on the outer wall of the Old City.In the nearby Jewish Quarter, barriers had been erected to make viewing the square impossible from ground level, and some residents said they had been told not to go onto their roofs overlooking the Western Wall.Simon, a 20-year-old American studying in a nearby Jewish seminary, said he was \"excited\" by Trump's visit but disappointed he would not see him.Around a dozen ultra-Orthodox Jewish men had crammed into a tiny terrace on top of one house looking over, seemingly having been granted permission.Share this story!Visit and follow our website: Duterte Hot News© Duterte Hot NewsSource: #http://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/05/23/17/trump-becomes-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-western-wall",

    "body": "In the battle for custody of a minor, parentage must be convincingly shown by the person claiming to be the real mother or father of the child. At present, parentage can be proven already not only by conventional method but also by the modern scientific method called DNA testing. But even if this new modern scientific method appears to be more reliable and definite to determine who is the real parent of the child, can the conventional method be still used and relied upon in determining parentage? If so, what is the proper remedy that should be filed in court? These are the issues to be resolved in this case of Anita and Ambo.Anita and Ambo are husband and wife with six children, the youngest being Sonny. When Sonny was only four months old Anita and Ambo became estranged and already separated thus forcing Anita to work as a laundry woman in the house of Levi and her common law husband, Jess. Usually, Levi would take care of Sonny while Anita is doing laundry.One time Levi went to Anita’s house to fetch her for an urgent laundry. Since Anita was on her way to do some marketing, she asked Levi to wait until she returned. She also left Sonny. under the care of Levi.When Anita returned from the market, Levi and Sonny were gone. So Anita rushed to the house of Levi but Levi’s maid told her that Levi went out for a stroll with Sonny and would come back later. Anita thus left and returned to Levi’s house three days later only to discover that Levi had moved to another place. So she complained to her Barangay Chairman and to the police who seemed unmoved by her pleas for assistance.The disappearance of Sonny somehow caused Anita and Ambo to be reconciled and reunited to look for their missing son in other places. But notwithstanding their serious efforts, they saw no traces of Sonny.Four years later Anita read in a tabloid about the death of Jess whose remains were lying in state in another province. Anita lost no time in going there and saw her son for the first time when the brother of Jess pointed him out to her who was then already named Jess Jr. But despite demands, Levi refused to return the boy to her.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1So Anita and Ambo already filed in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a Petition for Habeas Corpus to recover their son. They presented as witnesses the registered nurse who assisted in the delivery of Sonny at her clinic who submitted the clinical records of Sonny, and the brother of Jess who said that Jess was already sterile and could not bear a child, and that he boy named Jess Jr was only an adopted son.Levi on the other hand claimed that despite her ligation she still gave birth to Jess Jr at age 42 in a clinic of a midwife as evidenced by a birth certificate registered by Jess Sr., in the local Civil Registrar. But the RTC still ruled in favor of Anita and Ambo and ordered Levi to immediately release Sonny and turn him over to Anita and Ambo.Levi peacefully surrendered the child but still filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals (CA) which reversed and set aside the RTC decision on the ground that habeas corpus is not the proper remedy and that the evidence presented by Anita was not sufficient to establish that she was the mother of the minor. So Levi got back the minor forcing Anita and Ambo to file an appeal to the Supreme Court (SC).And according to the SC, the CA decision is wrong. The writ of habeas corpus extends to all cases in which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto. It is the proper remedy to enable parents to regain the custody of a minor child even if the latter be in the custody of another of his own free will.In the habeas corpus proceeding, the minor’s identity is relevant and material. It must be shown that Sonny is the same as Jess Jr. whom Levi insists to be her offspring.The SC ruled that a close scrutiny of the records of this case reveal that the evidence presented by Anita is sufficient to establish that Jess. Jr is actually Anita’s missing son Sonny.First, Levi herself admitted that after the birth of her second child, she underwent ligation before she cohabited with Jess Sr. The midwife who allegedly delivered Jess Jr. after the ligation, was not presented in court nor are the records, log book, or discharge order from the clinic submitted. Second, Jess Sr’s brother testified that Jess Sr. is already sterile because of an accident and he admitted to him that Jess Jr. is only an adopted son. Third, the birth certificate of Jess Jr. was filed by Jess Sr. himself, instead of the midwife or doctor as required by law. Furthermore the birth certificate stated that Jess Sr. and Levi were legally married which is false because even Levi herself admitted that she is only the common law wife. Fourth, when the child and Anita appeared in court, the two had strong similarities in their faces, eyes, eyebrows and head shapes which are competent and material to establish parentage. Fifth, the nurse who assisted Anita in giving birth, presented clinical records establishing Anita’s motherhood of Sonny.The SC further said that even if there is a new scientific method of definitely proving parentage of a child which is the DNA testing, parentage can still be resolved by using conventional method as in this case but eventually courts should apply and use the DNA methodSo the SC reversed the CA decision and reinstated the RTC decision granting the writ of habeas corpus in favor of Anita and Ambo Sr. and custody of their son Sonny (Tijing and Tijing vs/.

And if Converge truly becomes a significant competition, existing telcos might be forced to also improve their services. Or not, if they so choose to just eat up the challenger.",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Monday, February 17th, 2014ABS-CBN today announced that controversial TV host Willie Revillame is coming back to ABS-CBN to host a noontime show that will either take over “It’s Showtime”‘s time slot or the slot immediately after the popular show on Channel 2.ABS-CBN said that their management and Revillame have reached an amicable agreement and have basically ‘buried the hatchet’, referring to the well-publicized rift that happened between the company and the TV host several years back.Revillame’s new show, “Na WiWillie Na” will be based on previous shows hosted by Revillame, but will only include successful parts from these shows during his stint on ABS-CBN and the other network, TV5. This will include the popular children’s erotic dancing contest Revillame popularized on TV5, where children contestants are encouraged to dance erotic-themed numbers as the audience eggs them on, and scores the contestants according to how well they perform their gyrations.The show will also feature co-hosts that have been rumored to have ended their contracts with Revillame in a not-so-amicable fashion. This includes Valerie Concepcion, Janelle Jamer, Roxanne Guinoo and Ethel Booba.During a press conference at a restaurant on Timog Ave, Revillame said that he wanted the new show to mimic his previous show on ABS-CBN, Wowowee.“Ngayong babalik ako sa ABS-CBN, pareho ng ‘Wowowee’ pa rin ang gusto kong gawin kasi ‘yang ‘Wowowee’ na yan, iyan ang nagbigay sa akin ng lahat ng ito,” said the former Channel 2 host, referring his last successful noontime show on the ABS-CBN network. (Now that I’m going to return to ABS-CBN, I still would love to do something similar to ‘Wowowee’, because it was ‘Wowowee’ who gave all these things.)ABS-CBN did not comment during the press conference, however, an ABS-CBN advertising manager was heard after the conference that the bulk of the challenge will be acquiring sponsors, as most of their largest advertisers so far have not returned any of their calls, and weren’t too enthused with Revillame’s return.“Excited na excited na ako magsimula sa bago kong show, ‘Nawiwillie’. Marami na naman akong mahihirap na matutulungan.” Revillame said before driving off in his red Ferrari.",

This was part of the P650-million Naga River rehabilitation project funded from the community development fund (CDF) of VP Leni Robredo during the administration of Benigno “Noynoy”Aquino III.According to report by Bicol Standard last November 5, at least 55 meters of the Naga City Revetment Project collapsed at around 4:45 p.m., amid four days of continuous rains. The affected portion is located at the back of Sto. Nino Memorial Park. VP Robredo attended its inauguration on September 9, 2016, nearly 2 months before the said portion collapsed.“Oo kasi ito Naga River revetment, mayor pa ang asawa ko, panaginip na talaga ito. Kaya lang at that time napakahirap humingi sa national government. Kaya ilang decades panaginip lang talaga siya.” VP Robredo said in an ambush interview during the inauguration of the Naga River Revetment Project.“Pero noong nakaraang administrasyon, pinakinggan din ang ating panaginip. Binigyan tayo ng 375 million, at staggered sa pitongs projects. So halos ang buong portion ng Bicol river, ‘yong Naga River na tinatawag, naayos na.” She added, noting that the 5,670-meter project aims to provide convenience for the devotees of the annual Penafrancia Festival.Initially, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) blamed the incident to the 100-meter concrete fence construction on top of the revetment. In a statement, Sto. Niño Memorial Park owner Irene Mariano admitted that no permit was secured for the said fence. However, she categorically denied that it was not the cause of the collapse.",

Apo which Sara immediately thumbed down,” the President said.He said Sara would never allow anyone to get material from Mt. Apo only to be used in the reclamation project, no matter how small it is.“See, if you allow anyone to get material from Mt. Apo there will be landslide,” he added.In July 2011, Sara reportedly punched a court sheriff who refused to delay a demolition in Barangay Agdao. The mother of three was then on her first term as mayor.She asked the court sheriff earlier to delay the demolition of a property since she was still in another part of Davao City attending to the victims of a flash flood the night before.But when Sara arrived in Barangay Agdao, she got so mad at the sheriff for starting the demolition and for refusing to heed her call. She punched the sheriff not once, but thrice.",

The photographs were caught amid the recording of the up and coming fantasy series La Luna Sangre.In the photographs, Daniel is wearing a blue shirt with a towel on his shoulder, matched with his upset jeans while he was on a jeepney driver’s seat. His photographs circulated around the web via web-based networking media with subtitle: “Basta driver, sweet partner.

Take a look.Couple of different photographs were then highlighted in the Youtube video that additionally circled via web-based networking media before the current BTS takes.Transferred on Saturday, June 3, the video earned around 4,500 perspectives and blended responses from online clients.Loading...One commenter said: “Inggit lang kayo kasi malaki ang kanya. Haha! I love you, Dj.”Another one said: “Natural lang ‘yan. Magtaka kayo kung babae ang may bukol sa ganyan.”That one has a point. In the interim, his on-screen accomplice and reputed sweetheart, in actuality (IRL) Kathryn Bernardo was shooting in an alternate area. Instagram page @kdloves transferred the two youthful on-screen characters while on an alternate recording setting. Sadly, the record as of now went private.As a major aspect of their arrangement, the couple was likewise observed preparing in hand to hand fighting for the arrangement. La Luna Sangre will have activity filled scenes so they were apparently learning wushu and Pekiti-Tirsia Kali. Kathryn and Daniel cooperated in a few lighthearted comedy arrangement and motion pictures, however this is their first time to work in a dream appear.Loading...Anyway, La Luna Sangre is required to air at some point this year. It’s the third portion of the hit epic arrangement Lobo and Imortal. The primary trailer of the forthcoming dream arrangement was discharged last March 30, 2017, which made fans more energized.",

    "body": "Despite the ceasefire declared by both the Philippine government and the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army in August, the rebels are still extorting and kidnapping people in the areas of Sarangani and Davao, according to the Army.“We are calling the rebels in Sarangani province to stop kidnapping and extortion of the poor residents and elected officials as it would put in jeopardy the spirit of the ceasefire declared by the National Democratic Front in Norway which is to have an atmosphere of peace while peace talk is going on,” Lt. Col. Ronnie Babac, commanding officer of the Army’s 73rd Infantry Battalion, said in a statement.Barros said though progressive groups and the NPA somehow have similar demands, the former have been following the law while the latter opted to take up armed struggle.Peace talks between the Reds and the government started in 1986 after the ouster of Marcos, but successive governments have failed to convince the rebels to sign a final peace agreement. There were high expectations that a Duterte presidency could end the NPA rebellion since he had close ties with the Left when he was mayor of Davao City in the southern Philippines for more than two decades.Those hopes have quickly been dashed. Four rounds of talks that were briskly held between the government and the NDF in 2016 had further raised hopes about the prospect of finally achieving peace. But Duterte suspended the peace talks in February 2017 after the NPA ended its unilateral ceasefire.Peace advocates, for their part, had nonetheless continued to ask both sides to find a common ground in moving forward the negotiations, encouraged by the incremental progress made in some areas. For instance, prior to the suspension of the talks, the government and the NDF had agreed in principle to support the free distribution of land to small farmers, a significant move because majority of NPA members are farmers and indigenous peoples in remote villages.Apart from his occasional rants against the NPA, Duterte had never expressed interest in formally terminating the peace process altogether. But last week, he was outraged to learn that an infant was killed during an NPA ambush. That was apparently the last straw and led him to formally end the peace talks with his erstwhile allies which he now branded as terrorists.Before the announcement of the proclamation, the government’s chief negotiator had already indicated that all planned meetings with the NDF have been suspended already. This suggested that there were informal talks between the two parties on how to resume the peace process. Later, the NDF confirmed that the fifth round of talks was indeed already scheduled this month and that agreements on general amnesty for political prisoners, coordinated ceasefire, and substantive aspects of the social and economic agenda were ready for signing.The NDF, for its part, unsurprisingly accused Duterte of sabotaging the peace process with its move. It asserted that the group never threatened to terminate the peace process despite Duterte’s atrocious human rights record and his failure to uphold his campaign promise of fighting oligarchs. It vowed to resist Duterte’s order to launch a crackdown against suspected communist sympathizers.Beyond just the peace process itself, it remains to be seen whether Duterte’s proclamation could have broader implications. Could this, for instance, indicate his severance of ties with the Left? Will he expel the remaining Left-nominated members of his Cabinet?The termination of peace talks will also probably be used as a justification for the extension of martial law in Mindanao which is set to expire next month. Earlier, Duterte’s defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, said martial law was needed to defeat not just ISIS-backed terrorists in Marawi but also NPA rebels in the whole of Mindanao.In a blog post of Mr. Alon Calinao Dy,he said, “In order to have a progressive country, the problem with communist rebels should be settled immediately and the Filipinos like what President Duterte said Should have a strong AFP.”Will the end of the peace talks lead to the expansion of the all-out war policy of the government beyond Mindanao?After hosting the East Asia Summit, the Duterte government seemed to have clinched the support of several governments, notably China, Russia, and the United States, in strengthening the country’s military capabilities. Will this involve support for his counterinsurgency operations against the NPA?Beyond all this, what really worries many people in the Philippines is the repeated pronouncements of Duterte and his rabid supporters about the establishment of a so-called revolutionary government to solve the country’s problems. Some believe it is being peddled to implement Duterte’s vision of turning the Philippines into a federal state. But there is also the highly probable scenario of Duterte establishing a dictatorship similar to what Marcos did in the past. Seen from this perspective, the conflict with the NPA is something that any authoritarian leader would want to escalate to push the country nearer to a total war scenario and compel the use of extralegal powers of the state.",

Thanks to the vast number of active users on services like Facebook, acquiring new readers as a blogger or content provider has become easier than ever.In order to produce an effective digital campaign, you absolutely must take advantage of social media by doing things like integrating Facebook on Blogger . Email marketing can be useful, but it comes with restrictions that could limit your blog's potential. Perhaps the most significant problem is that emails don't come with a face or personality like Facebook does.Think of a time when you received an email in you inbox from someone you didn't know. Where you inclined to open it or did you send it right to the junk folder? If it's your first introduction to new consumer, they simply don't know who you are, what you want, and how you got their email. This sets off an initial breakdown of any type of trust that might have developed. The reputation of email marketing is further deteriorated with a study done by Kaspersky Lab, an Internet research firm. They estimate that around 70% of all the emails sent in the world are spam.Sharing site content using a Facebook Like Box is just one of many strategies that can generate a regular flow of traffic from a diverse demographic that might have been previously inaccessible. Adding a Facebook Like Box to your site helps to reduces your individual workload, and instead distributes that ability equally among your readers.When someone reads your content and appreciates the kind of work that you produce, they'll be willing to share that information to their followers and fans, setting off a viral reaction. The first step necessary to making this a reality is to make this change to your site. These next few steps will provide you with a quick and easy guide on how to add a 'Like Box' to your Blogger site so that you can began taking advantage of these great opportunities.1. Log into your Blogger account and select your blog > go to 'Layout' & click the 'Add a Gadget' link on the right side.2.

Duterte’s message was clear. He wanted to have peace with the rebels but the NPA seemed unapologetic and hard-headed. They continue to attack even the President Security Group vehicles while the peace talk in Netherlands was on-going. It was a clear manifestation that the rebels don’t want to end war with the government.What can you say about this?

Rodrigo Duterte and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe | Photo from GoogleIn a report, the Philippine’s incumbent president Rodrigo Roa Duterte is being considered by the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a member of his family.It can be recalled that the President recently visited Japan.The prime minister made the statement in a dinner that the latter hosted for Pres. Rodrigo Duterte and the rest of the Philippine delegation in the prime minister’s residence himself which wrapped up Pres. Duterte’s day 1 of visit on Japan, Monday night.According to the Japanese premier, “When I visited the Philippines January this year, both my wife Akie and I had a pleasure visiting President Duterte’s house in Davao City. I very much appreciate the gracious hospitality extended to me and to my wife”.“We have been like family in deepening our close ties over time and I am very pleased with such warm relationship,” he added.It was Mr. Shinzo Abe who was the first world leader to visit the home of Pres. Duterte in Davao City.Mr. Shinzo Abe said “So here is a message from me to those distinguished guests: I owe you so much and your dedication is what made possible for us to enjoy today’s wonderful ties between Japan and the Philippines. And taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation and ask for your continuous support as we further develop this special relationship”.With Pres. Rodrigo Duterte sharing the same sentiment that of Abe’s, the former said “I am truly honored and humbled to join you this evening. While this is my second official visit to Tokyo, I must tell you that my personal interest and excitement over this trip has not diminished. I thank Prime Minister Abe and Madame Akie Abe for hosting this evening’s reunion between friends”.The Philippine president added “Suffice it to say that this frequency of interaction is friendship that goes beyond official lines. It is a friendship that is held dearly and valued so much more than words can describe. I will strive to keep that friendship, amity and cooperation between us, our nations and our peoples going from strength to further strength”.In the upcoming Association of Southeast Nations Leaders’ Summit that will take place on November 10 to 15 where Manila will be the host country, Duterte and Abe will meet again.Source: The Manila Times",

    "body": "Senator Risa Hontiveros has had some trouble in her previous political performance when she sat as board member of Philhealth in 2013.The National Association of Lawyers for Justice and Peace (NALJP) challenged Hontiveros in April 2016 to initiate the return of Php1.761 billion unauthorized bonuses given to officers and employees of Philhealth in 2013 when she was still a board member.NALJP founding chairman Jesus Santos stressed that Philhealth funds are owned by the people, and not by the few officials in high ranks.He even elaborated that the Php 1.761 billion is a huge amount enough to cover medicines, medical needs, and medical services of several Philhealth beneficiaries.“Since PhilHealth funds are the people’s money, Ms. Hontiveros should show us that we can trust her with our welfare by leading efforts to get back the illegal bonuses. If she will not do anything about it, there’s no reason to be confident that she will indeed serve the people should she win,” Santos said.Hontiveros was still only a senatorial candidate that time when NALJP complained about the bonuses and Santos opined that her credibility as a public servant would only be established if she returned the illegal bonuses that were incurred during her term as Philheath board member.Even when Philhealth argued that the bonuses it gave to its employees were covered by board resolutions, Commission on Audit (COA) stated that the Office of the President did not receive those resolutions, thus were not approved, which illegalizes the transaction under Section 6 of the Presidential Decree 1597.Santos pointed out that Hontiveros is aware of this Presidential Decree, and yet did not pursue any legal action regarding the disbursement of bonuses.“It has never been reported that she [Hontiveros] has exerted any effort for the return of the illegal bonuses. Nobody knows if she had even opposed the unauthorized bonuses, or had just simply went along with those who allowed it,” Santos emphasized.As part of the board that time, Santos underlined that Hontiveros had a lot of explaining to do.sourceCommentscomments",

    "body": "Recently, ABS-CBN reporter Doris Bigornia was involved in a multiple car collision along Shaw, specifically at the EDSA-Shaw Boulevard tunnel in Mandaluyong City.According to Philippine Entertainment Portal, the accident happened during the afternoon of Dec. 21, 2017. She sustained injuries on the head after their crew vehicle collided with a Montero Sport.The reporter’s head was hit inside the car, hence the injuries. The driver and the cameraman also sustained injuries from the accident as well. The source cited that five vehicles were involved in the collision.Doris Bigornia was rushed to The Medical City in Pasig City after the incident. Fortunately, her injuries were not fatal or life-threatening.Facebook user Edison Bong Berija also shared videos that featured the accident.In an additional report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) stated that the accident occurred around 1:45 p.m. when the Montero Sport going towards the northbound side of the EDSA-Shaw tunnel “suddenly went wild” and crossed the center island.It hit a Toyota Vios that was originally going towards the south of the tunnel. The Vios, in turn, collided with another Montero Sport that flipped and hit the van where Doris Bigornia was riding.Bong Nebrija, the supervising officer for MMDA operations, said in an interview, “Nag-sudden unintended acceleration, talagang bumilis [‘yung Montero Sport with plate number], biglang umarangkada.”Meanwhile, the MMDA and the Eastern Police District – Traffic Management Office are both conducting investigations on the multiple car collision.The source said:“The accident led to the temporary closure of the Edsa-Shaw underpass and caused a traffic standstill along the stretch of Edsa from Ayala to Kamuning. The vehicles were cleared of the road at 3:28 p.m.”Based on News 5 Interaksyon’s report, Doris Bigornia and her crew were supposed to cover an event in Cubao, Quezon City prior to the accident.Meanwhile, here are the videos that were shared by Berija:WARNING: Some scenes below may contain graphic scenes. Discretion is advised.This is the dash cam shot of the Mitsubishi Mirage whose bumper was hit by the Montero that crossed over from southbound lane to northbound lane of Shaw Underpass. You will see in the video how the crew cab of ABS CBN was hit, that injured Mam Doris Bigornia and her cameraman Marco.

Danielo Bellezas, chief of the Bukidnon police’s community relations office, authorities recovered what remained of Ma in a banana plantation in Lantapan town.Some parts of the victim’s body – which had been chopped off – were found strewn on the ground while several parts were inside a cooking pot.It remains unclear as to why the suspect killed and cannibalized the old man.However, Senior Police Officer I Roy Yacapin said, as per an Inquirer reports, that Villegas upon arrest appeared “to be disconnected from reality.”“He was just smiling during interrogation. We need to have him examined,” Yacapin said.He also added that the suspect could be suffering from mental problem.Bellezas stated the incident needs a professional opinion from a psychiatrist in order to determine if the suspect was suffering from a psychological disorder.The police chief pointed out that only an expert can attest to his (Villegas) real mental condition in court, which will decide if he can be acquitted or penalized.He noted that the Lantapan police report had nothing on Villegas’ family history.However, there’s a possibility that the suspect could be an illegal drug user, he added.Bellezas also said that last September, depression also drove a Bukidnon mother to hack her three children. One of her children died in the attack.The difference with Villegas’ case was that the woman did not try to cannibalize her children but attempted to take her own life instead.Source: Visayan Daily StarCommentscomments",

Mr. Vinet Alforque Sr.'s honesty has been recognized by the board because it was not the first time the taxi driver did good to his passengers.Alforque's good deeds as a taxi driver came to the attention of LTFRB after a video posted by Raffy Tulfo In Action's Facebook page went viral. In that video, he appealed to singer Maegan Aguilar, daughter of Freddie Aguilar, to stop bashing him and his family on social media.Aguilar accused Alforque of stealing his valuables that she accidentally left on his taxi. Eventually, the guitar and a bunch of bowls was brought back to her with the help of the LTFRB and operator of Nimble taxi, the company where Alforque is a long time driver.Aguilar did not count herself fortunate enough for the safe return of her valuables and instead took to social media to post malicious messages on her account stating that the driver would not return her belongings if not for the LTFRB. She even said in one post that the taxi driver and his operator are having an affair.The said posts by the singer reached the family of Alforque prompting him and his wife to seek help from Raffy Tulfo's program on TV5 where both parties were given chance to talk via phone call. The actress would not retract her accusations against Alforque and even implied that she would continue to bash the taxi drive on social media unless Tulfo can make other netizens stop bashing her as well.The taxi driver and the singer did not come to an amicable settlement.Meanwhile, even before her dispute with the taxi driver reached Tulfo's program, the singer had already posted on social media that she's not afraid of Tulfo and that her father and the president Duterte are best friends.

    "body": "3771 SHARES Share TweetKamias or also known as blimbi are one of the most underestimated fruits in the world. It is similar to the star fruit, but the kamias fruit has a specific sour flavour, which makes an incredible addition to a large number of exotic cuisines around the world.The fruit is native to the Philippines and it the people there are highly aware of its beneficial properties.The fruit itself is packed with vitamins C and B as well as minerals such as iron, phosphorus and antioxidants. Kamias isn’t as popular as other tropical fruits, but its popularity has been rapidly growing thanks to its recently-discovered high nutritional value.It’s funny that while we Filipinos are so familiar with Kamias, we rarely look into their healing properties. Because of its complex nutritional compounds the mighty plant, from the stem to the flower to the fruit, can be used for these purposes:1. Treating CoughYou can easily relieve cough by mixing a few grains of fennel, 3 pieces of kamias, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil then steam for several hours. Divide the water in two. Drink the first half in the morning on an empty stomach, and the other half in the evening.2. Overcome DiabetesKamias is extremely beneficial for people suffering from diabetes. Prepare 6 pieces of Kamias and crush. Mix with water and boil the mixture. When ready, strain and drink twice a day.3. Overcome AcneKamias’ acid properties can help in treating acne. Just crush into fine powder and apply topically as needed.4. Overcome Thrush or SingawJust like in the previous number, crush the Kamias and apply topically. Be warned, this will sting.5. RheumatismAlleviating rheumatic pain can easily be done by crushing a few kamias leaves and one peice of kamias and mixing the two together until you end up with a smooth mixture. Mix this with water and apply it on the affected areas. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times a day.As usual with natural remedies, it is best to treat the problem with proper exercise, diet and a consultation with your doctor.",

But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.Commentscomments",

How easy it might be for some to acquire material things, like phones or bags, but sadly, the same couldn’t be said for others. We have families and individuals who work to the bone to be able to provide something that takes only a minute for some to have. But no matter how unfair this truth might be, it is always inspiring to see a hardworking man reap the fruits of his labor.Loading...This is what a shoe store owner witnessed one day. Caloy Pineda was at World Balance in SM Muntinlupa when an old man, probably in his late 30s or early 40s, went inside his store.Caloy said that this particular customer was wearing old clothes and a pair of used flip-flops but his staff immediately went to him for assistance. You could tell by looking at the man’s face that he was used to doing hard labor.But any sign of exhaustion was gone and replaced by excitement. Caloy guessed that maybe after working hard, the customer was excited that he can finally afford new shoes. While the staff was preparing the shoes he chose, the man opened his wallet and Caloy was surprised to see a bunch of PHP 20 bills.It was then that he realized that this hardworking man must have saved a lot so that he could buy new shoes. Fortunately, a lady was near him and happened to see the situation. This woman offered to add to the man’s money so he can choose something better. Although hesitant at first, he gladly accepted the woman’s generosity.Caloy couldn’t help but be thrilled about what he saw. He thanked the generous woman through a text message for being so selfless and making the man’s day complete. The kind-hearted woman, Lilliam Mateo Quiat, explained that she wanted to give more but was not able to bring her wallet with her which is why she was only able to give PHP 500.Let this story serve as an inspiration to do good and expect that people’s kindness will come through.What did you realize when you read this man’s story? Are you more grateful for the material things you have right now? Share your thoughts, reactions, and opinions in the comments section below!",

    "body": "Are we seeing something of a thaw in the Liberal Party of the Philippines’ coldness towards President Rodrigo Duterte, his administration and his policies? For the past six months, since Duterte was elected, the Liberal Party, largely through its mainstream media proxies and other mouthpieces, have conducted a campaign of vicious allegations, character assassination and doubt-sowing against this new government – and, in particular, against the person of Duterte himself. Innuendo has flowed like a river in spate from the Left elites in media and showbiz and from LP-supporter sites across the Net. But is that starting to have run its course?To some degree – possibly, maybe; at least as far as the Liberal Party itself is concerned. And here’s why we think that.Yesterday, Kris Aquino, sister of former president and Liberal Party grandee, Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino, was due to go on stage with Duterte at a the National Micro, Small, and Medium Entrepreneurs’ Summit in Davao City. Duterte who had returned home from a state visit to Malaysia in the early hours of the morning and was incapacitated by a minor illness, had to cancel his appearance at the event. But, evidently, Kris Aquino was a little upset at not meeting the president and said that she hoped they would be able to get together in the future. It was an impassioned plea; “Please give me a chance,” she implored.As a former talk-show host, Kris Aquino, the “Queen of All Media,” undoubtedly would love to interview Duterte. It would be an intriguing get together – the president taking questions from the sister of the leader of the party that has been after Duterte’s hide since the day he announced his candidacy for the presidency. Ratings would be high. It’s not entirely clear, however that such an interview was the intention – Kris Aquino isn’t working for any TV network right now. But such a meeting could have some other appeal.Although she’s the sister of the former president, Kris Aquino is not a died-in-the-wool Liberal Party apparatchik. In the election just passed, for example, she didn’t endorse the LP’s presidential candidate, Mar Roxas, she supported Independent challenger, Grace Poe; for the VP slot, she went with Independent Chiz Escudero, not the Liberal’s Leni Robredo. In the senatorial contest, she endorsed Nancy Binay of LP rival, the United Nationalists Alliance (UNA) and daughter of former VP, Jejomar Binay. She campaigned for other UNA candidates elsewhere. The point being that in any meeting with Duterte she is unlikely to be offering him any Liberal Party perspective.But she would be in a position to extend some form of détente on behalf of the Liberal Party. And that would be useful – not just to bring politics back to a better level of debate and, hopefully, get some cross-party consensus on the more difficult issues facing the country and thus waste less Congress time – but, particularly, for the LP itself. And her brother might well appreciate that.The fact is it’s getting increasingly more difficult for the Liberals to deny Duterte’s successes. His flurry of foreign trips around the region has been difficult to fault; as is the drop in the crime figures and the ever-expanding drug-rehabilitation programme. The media may choose to downplay all that, and although in time that will only work against the media – by continuing to expose themselves as the totally biased, out-of-touch, arrogant, ‘we-know-better-than-the-idiots-out there’ sham they are – Liberal Party politicians should by now be waking up to the fact that it could further harm them in terms of the electorate going forward.Sure, the TV networks and the online versions of Philippine dailies will ultimately pay a price as one-time audiences continue to desert them to get their news coverage and analysis from social media, but for the political class, ending up on the wrong side of a protracted political feud, can be a terminal experience. It’s a big graveyard.The cold hard fact is this: a successful Duterte term could see the Libs exiled to a political Sahara. Just two things: if Duterte gets the drugs pestilence in the Philippines under control, and if he boosts inward investment to the country with all that that implies – a booming infrastructure sector, millions of more new jobs – then the LP is really going to have its work cut out in getting voters to even recognise their party, much less vote for it.Political parties which fail in their bid for power start preparing for the next election virtually the day after their defeat. And so there’s likely to have been a lot of soul searching within the LP ranks over the past six months. And hopefully the realisation has been reached within the LP that if they want to remain a major force in Philippine politics – whether leading it or in opposition – they need to dispense with the childish self-righteous outrage with tears welling and the low point-scoring sniping with blood rushing and start debating like mature parliamentarians. And, above all, cutting the hissy-fit image and start displaying a little more gravitas.Similarly, the embittered sneering of Leftist Netizens with their brain-dead online posts of “FU30” and such like are never going to win any political debate; they’re never going to persuade members of the other camp to consider their arguments. Far from it, Internet garbage like that is only going to harden their resolve and reinforce the reasons why they didn’t vote Liberal last time and redouble their resolve not to do so next time. If you insult people for what they believe, don’t be surprised if they harden their stance.Which brings us to one person in the Liberal establishment who will look at that reasoning as if it was written in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics – Senator Leila De Lima. She, it seems, is pathologically incapable of understanding that the man who she attacks like a pit bull, is held in the highest esteems. 92% of her fellow countrymen and women love him. For them he is their guardian and their hope. Trying to get these people to her side – someone needs to tell her – is like King Canute sitting on the shore and commanding the waves and the tide to turn back. It’s not going to happen. Not even for this precious princess.Certainly, there’s been a tangible distancing of the LP’s leadership from De Lima’s vendetta politics. But for ordinary people – that majority of voters who swept Duterte to power and stand by him to a man – her tarnished crusade has the potential to drag the Liberal Party ship to the bottom. And once it starts taking on water and sinking it will be pretty well doomed.",

    "body": "When Amazon officially took over Whole Foods this week, the e-commerce giant immediately made changes. It drastically cut prices on some organic foods, by as much as 43 per cent, and set up in-store displays to sell its smart speaker, the Amazon Echo.But the biggest disruption may still be in the works: an expansion of its online grocery ordering and delivery service.“Consumers should be able to win because hopefully Amazon will bring to the grocery industry what they were able to bring in terms of online commerce,” said Marion Chan, a consumer analyst at TrendSpotter Consulting.Amazon Dash buttons let customers order a particular product with a single touch. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)Amazon first changed the way consumers buy books, then expanded to sell almost any product a consumer could want — and deliver it when they want it.Amazon has tried to make itself part of consumers’ everyday lives, from introducing its Dash button for the home that customers can press when they want to order more of a product, to Amazon Prime memberships that give access to online streaming and free shipping.Virtual shopping cartsBut grocery delivery is a relatively new and challenging sector. Shipping perishable, easy-to-bruise items requires a greater level of care than a book does. Plus, it requires consumers to change long-entrenched behaviour.“They actually go to the store,” Chan said. “That’s the way Canadians have learned to shop.”That’s not stopping Amazon from trying it out. It’s already testing the waters with AmazonFresh grocery delivery in 20 cities across the U.S., as well as in London, Berlin and Tokyo.The company wouldn’t confirm to CBC News whether it has plans to expand AmazonFresh to Canada.But in some parts of Canada, variations of online grocery delivery already exist, and Amazon’s interest in the space is a clear message to the industry.An InstaBuggy employee fills a customer’s online food order at a grocery store in Toronto. (Robert Parker/CBC)“It validates the fact that the online space is here to stay and there’s true demand from a consumer standpoint,” said Julian Gleizer, founder and CEO of grocery delivery startup InstaBuggy.Through InstaBuggy’s app, customers can order from a variety of different grocery stores. Their order is then hand-picked, packed and delivered by InstaBuggy in as little as an hour.“It makes sense for customers to place their order from their couch or from their office, as opposed to having to go to the store, spend that time, and carry stuff,” Gleizer said.Chains already move groceries onlineMajor grocery chains are also recognizing the potential in adding digital and delivery options.Longo’s operates an online delivery service called Grocery Gateway in the Toronto area; Metro, which has stores in Ontario and Quebec, just made a deal to buy a meal kit delivery service called MissFresh; and Loblaws introduced a “click and collect” program, where customers pick out their groceries online, then pick them up in person.Chan expects the threat from Amazon will spark even more innovation in the grocery business.“Just because this is happening between Amazon and Whole Foods — the Loblaws, the Sobeys, they are all going to have to respond,” she said. “I think that the grocery industry in Canada is ready for a change and in fact we need a change.”Buying into Amazon’s ecosystemGrocers could have a tough time competing with Amazon though. Some analysts say the company isn’t entering the grocery business for the money — it’s more interested in getting consumers to buy further into Amazon’s entire ecosystem.“They’re looking at increasing volume essentially, and that’s Amazon’s playbook. Looking at revenues and profitability is not as important,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a business professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax who specializes in food distribution.Charlebois sees Amazon’s latest move as a way to further disrupt how consumers shop, and move them from stores to online.“They’re trying to build that bridge between the two worlds, and Amazon is well positioned to do that because it is able to understand consumers better than consumers themselves,” Charlebois said.TrendSpotter’s Chan isn’t convinced Canadian consumers will have an appetite to do all of their grocery shopping online. But if Amazon enters the market and others innovate, she says consumers will win.“If [consumers] aren’t excited about this change, they should be excited.”",

    "body": "The National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, also called the Redemptorist Church or the “Baclaran Church”, is not new when it comes to making bold statements which condemn the government’s actions that the Church deems to be wrong. It is one of the most vocal and fearless parishes when it comes to condemning extra-judicial killings.Last year, as the tradition of “Simbang Gabi“ started, churchgoers of Baclaran stumbled upon an unexpected sight. Mounted outside the church were chilling photos of the killings linked to government’s war on drugs. Poster-sized and illuminated, the Redemptorist Church admitted that it was the one who spearheaded the said project to show its condemnation of the killings.According to Retired Archbishop Oscar Cruz, “Sampu lang naman ang utos ng Diyos eh. Isa nga po dyan ay huwag kang papatay. Ang estado ay hindi naman siya ang nagbigay ng buhay ng tao. Anong karapatan niyang kunin ito?”This year, the Baclaran Church again encouraged people to make a stand against extra-judicial killings. It covered the INRI sign of its crucifix with a cardboard that says “Stop the Killings”, mimicking the ones left on top of drug suspects in the vigilante-style killings. The covering of the crucifix was part of the weekend-long activities of the Church for Human Rights Day. The big reveal of the 700-foot long mural wall “Panagpo” depicting the parish’s seven missions, which include human rights protection, is also part of the said activities. It is the latest Baclaran church display in protest of the killings in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. The activities are intended to raise awareness and spark conversations on human rights.On Saturday, December 9, the “Kilusang Artikulo 13” movement was also launched in the Baclaran Church by Redemptorist priests and groups alike. “Artikulo 13” refers to Article XIII of the Philippine Constitution, where “Social Justice and Human Rights” can be found. This movement urges the government to respect life and human rights.Check out this video for more information:What can you say about the Baclaran Church’s latest display of its protest against the killings in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs?

Duterte reportedly bought the said townhouse for his son Sebastian in 2001, when the President was then Davao City congressman.Geez, Rapplerettes never learn.Rappler's 19 May 2017 article \" How Duterte's wealth in 1st 6 months compares with Aquino's \" is basically a one-thousand-word essay accusing President Rodrigo Duterte of amassing ill-gotten wealth while Rappler conveniently ignores publicly available facts.In that article, Ressa's minion Michael Bueza, the same guy who murdered PNP's crime stats, said compared changes in Duterte's SALN to that of Aquino.Aside from the really, really bad math, I cannot for the life of me understand why such an analysis is even relevant when Duterte himself said recently that the P3-million jump in his net worth is from amount ABS-CBN owes him after the latter did not air his campaign ads [ GMA ].But what's most striking in the entire tinapa-wrapper of an article is the mention of a certain alleged Duterte-owned San Juan property, which Rappler has extensively, though amateurishly, discussed in the May 2016 article \" Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra Property Let me quote that part of May 19 article:You see, I have already definitively debunked this theory last year, and let me show you what I wrote back then .",

I respect him and everything that he’s been doing.“Maski na there are some things na I’m not for, it doesn’t matter, e.“Kasi, at the end of the day, he’s our leader and we have to respect him.“And so, with everything that he’s been doing so far, I’m very, very happy.

However, the Yuletide season becomes extra special when we get to spend it with our family and all the people we love dearly. Unfortunately, not everyone gets to celebrate the holidays with their loved ones. This is why Juan Paulo Fermin, a Second Officer at the Philippine Airlines (PAL) considers being reunited with his parents after being away from them for 16 years his lifelong dream.To finally fulfil his desire, Juan Paulo did all that he could do to see his parents again and fly them back home – just in time for Christmas. The precious moment was captured on video and uploaded online. It instantly moved the hearts of a huge number of netizens.Loading...In the video, Juan Paulo was seen walking down the plane aisle with a pocketful of red roses. As he reached his mom’s seat, she was awestruck. John Paulo’s mom could only muster the words: “Hala! Anak ko!” The two then shared a tight, meaningful embrace.A few moments later, Juan Paulo’s father came into view and they also gave each other a warm hug. His dad’s eyes gleamed upon seeing his son again after so many years apart.Juan Paulo shared the footage of his tearful family reunion on Facebook. He wrote in the caption:“It’s interesting how dreams take form – like when a sick loved one prompts a young man to become a doctor, or being with kids who haven’t had the chance to read and write inspires one to teach; as a child, to me it was pretty simple: I wanted to fly my parents home.”“Today, after 16 Christmases apart – and unknown to my parents, I was actually part of the crew that was flying them home for Christmas. It’s been a wonderful year for me – a year of dreams turning into reality, and this is definitely the cherry on top. Thank you, Philippine Airlines, for this amazing opportunity.”The video has already amassed over 1 million views, around 36,000 reactions, and about 7,000 shares on Facebook as of this writing.Philippine Airlines re-posted the one-minute and 30-second clip on their official Facebook page. They captioned it with:“Sharing this wonderful experience from one of our pilots. Nothing warms our hearts more than reuniting families so that they can spend the holidays with the people they love the most. Happy holidays!”WATCH THE VIDEO FOOTAGE BELOWLoading...Commentscomments",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines – Nag-iingay si Sen. Leila de Lima upang malihis ang isyu sa kaniya sa pagkalat ng ilegal na droga sa loob ng New Bilibid Prison, ayon sa Palasyo ngayong Lunes.Sinabi ng Malacanang na ginagamit din ni De Lima ang kaniyang pagkababae upang pagtakpan ang mga ebidensya laban sa kaniya.“Senator Leila de Lima is apparently playing the gender card as a shield against mounting evidence of her ties with high-profile drug lords and the proliferation of drug trade in the Bilibid,” pahayag ni Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella.“By potraying herself as a victim she seeks to distance herself from the intimate relationships which were also intertwined with drug trafficking while she was DOJ Secretary,” dagdag niya.Sinabi ito ni Abella kasunod ng paghahain ni De Lima ng Writ of Habeas Data sa Korte Suprema laban kay Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte.“Senator De Lima’s filing of a petition before the Supreme Court is calculated to generate media noise to drown out the accusations against her,” patuloy ng tagapagsalita.Nakasaad sa 26-pahina na petisyon ni De Lima na ginamit ng Pangulo ang kaniyang kapangyarihan at opisina upang husgahan siya.\"Can a sitting President wage a personal vendetta against petitioner and use the resources of his powerful office to crucify her as a woman, a human being, and a duly elected senator in violation of her right to privacy in life, liberty and security?\" nakasaad sa petisyon.Isiniwalat ni Duterte noon na kalaguyo ng senadora ang kaniyang dating driver na si Ronnie Dayan. Si De Lima rin ang itinuturo ng Department of Justice (DOJ) na nasa likod ng pagkalat ng ilegal na droga sa Bilibid.Inakusahan din ng Pangulo at ng DOJ si De Lima na may sex video kasama si Dayan. Umabot pa sa puntong ipalalabas dapat ito sa pagdinig ng Kamara ngunit hindi ito natuloy dahil wala umanong kopyang hawak si DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II.\"He has accused her of 'screwing her driver,' 'pumping,' and playing with a man's genitals. He has likened her to an 'x-rated artist' and claimed that she has a 'propensity for sex,'\" wika ng kampo ni De Lima.\"He has threatened her that he 'will destroy her in public,' that she 'is finished' and has vowed that she 'will rot in jail,\" dagdag niya.Matapos ang imbestigasyon sa Kamara at pagharap ng mga high-profile inmates sa pagdinig ay hindi rin sinampahan ng kaso ng si De Lima.Hiniling naman ni De Lima na pigilan ng mataas na hukuman ang gobyerno sa paggamit ng kaniyang mga personal information upang siraan siya.",

It is God who will decide your fate.Since your job is to educate the faithful, my job is to eradicate those who are killing the faithful. How can one think about God, honor his father, mother, brothers, sisters and neighbors if he has been affected by drugs ? An addict only thinks of when to get the next fix and if he cannot afford it, he will steal, he will rob your home and even kill just to satisfy his addiction. That is my job – Cardinal, it is not for me, but for the next generation whom I want to see a truly “drug free society” in our country. Can you solve that problem Cardinal ?CARDINAL : No, I cannot solve the drug problem.PRESIDENT : Look at the squatters behind your comfort zone, go and try to examine the gravity of the drug problem in this nation caused by the previous government – a total neglect of the human being’s potential to grow and prosper. They destroyed our people – Cardinal, and you remained quiet on that. You should examine your conscience and try to fight this evil within.CARDINAL : Perhaps I will.PRESIDENT : You might look at me as a street educated person, a probinsyano, a lowly person who is not educated in Ateneo, but please be reminded that I am elected by more than 16 million Filipinos, while you are just appointed by the Vatican. Let it sink for a moment. Peace be with you Cardinal.",

    "body": "Facebook just made it harder for you to share fake newsFacebook has started to roll out a new tool in its war against fake news which facts check the stories you post, although it doesn’t yet appear for everyone.Mark Zuckerberg vowed to tackle the fake news controversy after the social media site was criticised for becoming a breeding ground for the spreading of misinformation.Some Facebook users in the United States have reported seeing a pop-up window appear when an article is disputed by third-party fact checkers.Media reporter John Ourand tweeted: “Facebook’s war on fake news starts with a pop up window for re-posters of bad info.”Facebook’s war on fake news starts with a pop up window for re-posters of bad info. pic.twitter.com/qpPXZjLL3u — John Ourand (@Ourand_SBJ) 19 de marzo de 2017The pop-up says: “Disputed by multiple, independent fact-checkers.“Before you share this content, you might want to know that the fact-checking sites, Snopes.com and Associated Press disputed its accuracy.”The five types of fake newsStories classified as fake news can generally be put into five categories, as experts try to develop a way of warning readers what they may be encountering.1. Intentionally deceptiveThese are news stories created entirely to deceive readers. The 2016 US election was rife with examples claiming that “x celebrity has endorsed Donald Trump”, when that was not the case.2. Jokes taken at face valueHumour sites such as the Onion or Daily Mash present fake news stories in order to satirise the media. Issues can arise when readers see the story out of context and share it with others.3. Large-scale hoaxesDeceptions that are then reported in good faith by reputable news sources. A recent example would be the story that the founder of Corona beer made everyone in his home village a millionaire in his will.4. Slanted reporting of real factsSelectively-chosen but truthful elements of a story put together to serve an agenda. One of the most prevalent examples of this is the PR-driven science or nutrition story, such as ‘x thing you thought was unhealthy is actually good for you’.5. Stories where the ‘truth’ is contentiousOn issues where ideologies or opinions clash – for example, territorial conflicts – there is sometimes no established baseline for truth. Reporters may be unconsciously partisan, or perceived as such.Reference: Deception Detection for News, University of Western OntarioIt pops up for some users, depending on their location, on a story about a debunked conspiracy theory about a so-called “Irish slave trade” – which never existed.According to Quartz, the AP link explains: “The false articles, trending on social media as Ireland’s national holiday approaches, typically reprint entire sections for a comprehensively debunked 2008 column posted on a website that promotes conspiracy theories.”However, it does not yet appear to have been rolled out to Facebook users in the UK.Facebook announced in December it would be flagging stories as disputed, with the aim of “providing more context [to] help people decide for themselves what to trust and what to share”.“We’ll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organisations,” Facebook said.“If the fact checking organisations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.” [source]Commentscomments",

While some people still prefer to make traditional houses into homes, more and more couples are looking to invest in condominiums instead. Why? Mostly for the convenient “packages” that these types of homes come in.In the feature with Pep.ph, Yasmien enumerated all the reasons why they felt living in a condo would be better for her adorable daughter, Ayesha Zara. According to Rey, everything is already inside the condo, even a playground for Ayesha! Yasmien agreed and added that the security was also a bonus since she and her husband have very busy schedules.Before ka makaakyat, iyong visitor or kung sinuman, they [security personnel] would call you up. And then, dahil sa CCTV cameras, nalalaman namin kung saan pumupunta si Ayesha. Security and safety talaga no’ng bata iyong iniisip namin,” the Starstruck finalist emphasized.Although relatively small, the tiny family has made many meaningful memories in their three-bedroom unit in Taguig– “Do’n na ako nagbuntis, do’n na lahat. So, a lot of memories na ang nangyari sa place na ito. Kaya love na love namin ang house na ito.”She also shares that one reason that the place was special to her was because she was the chief interior decorator! Rey and Yasmien really put their styles and ideas together to make the perfect charming home for their family. “Gusto kasi namin na sa bawat sulok ng house namin, iba-iba ‘yong theme na makikita mo,” the Kapuso actress enthused.",

China was absent throughout the proceedings, refusing to recognize the case.“The Tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line,” the statement released to the media said.“Having found that none of the features claimed by China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the Tribunal found that it could—without delimiting a boundary—declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China,” it added.The Tribunal also said that China has violated Philippine sovereign rights.“Having found that certain areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, the Tribunal found that China had violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by (a) interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration, (b) constructing artificial islands and (c) failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone,” the tribunal statement said.“The Tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line,”The Tribunal further held that Chinese law enforcement vessels had unlawfully created a serious risk of collision when they physically obstructed Philippine vessels,” it said.The Spratly Islands and its many reefs are being claimed by China under its “nine-dash line” claim that covers nearly the entire South China Sea including parts of the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).ALSO READ: Chinese President Orders People’s Liberation Army to “Prepare For Combat”China insists it has “historic rights” in asserting its ownership of the region believed to be rich in natural gas resources and also a vital trade route for international cargo ships.Philippines filed its case in January 2013 following a tense standoff between Chinese and Philippines ships at Scarborough shoal in April 2012.Since the initiation of the arbitration case, China has conducted several massive reclamation projects to turn submerged reefs into artificial islands capable of hosting military structures and equipment.China’s reclamation activities have alarmed other Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam, that also have competing claims in the South China Sea.

He is one among 23 lucky recruits out of more than 20,000 applicants, to fly into outer space on 2018.Daniel “Chino” Roque, a 24 year old psychology graduate from La Salle bested more than 20,000 applicants including two fellow Pinoys. He is scheduled to fly outer space next year, but the plan has changed after NASA released a report about a shocking discovery concerning Metro Manila.NASA on late October reported that half of Manila could be gone in 50 yearsClimate change, too much garbage, over population, and over industrialization are among the reasons why Metro Manila’s land couldn’t hold its heavy load anymore.AXE Apollo Space Academy, the private company that selected Roque was asked by NASA if the government agency can use Roque’s services instead of just touring the space.Loading…NASA said Roque will be included in the next batch of 8 who will be replacing the current astronauts assigned in International Space Station (ISS).Among 8 people are 2 Russian Cosmonauts, 3 American Astronauts, 1 British, 1 Israeli, and Roque – the first Philippine Astronaut.Roque’s mission is specific on gathering data about Philippines’ weather, atmosphere, and other factors that can affect Manila’s future disappearance.Roque will be guided by American Astronaut and Physicist Dr. Amanda Schroeder, former Professor and Scientist at MIT.Chino Roque is scheduled to stay at Kennedy Space Center for 4 full months of space training. Report said that the voyage is scheduled on June to August, 2018..“Filipinos are expecting what Roque can bring but regardless of the outcome, it is already a great Philippine pride to have our own Astronaut in space who is observing our country”, Dr. Ronald Borce, a Filipino-American Professor at University of Arizona – Dept. of Astronomy, told TPP. /Perfecto Claro/",

    "body": "I’ve heard blogging referred to a couple of times recently as a mixture between an art and a science. If this is true (and I think it is), there’s no ‘right way’ to approach blogging if you want to be successful. There are plenty of people who’ve done a great job of it though, and I thought it would be useful to learn from them.These 16 bloggers shared one important tip each for blogging beginners. No doubt, even if you’re not a beginner these tips will probably prove to be useful.1. Get ideas from your audienceCreate blog posts that answer the most interesting questions from people you engage with on social media. Dave Larson, founder of @tweetsmarterThis can be a great way to gather ideas of what topics people would most like to read about, which will help your blog grow! One of the best ways I’ve seen this in action is through blog comments or Tweets. In one example, here on FastCompany a lot of people requested a post that features more women entrepreneurs:Now, a few weeks later adding such an article where just women contributed and built great businesses was a big hit:2. Understand your audienceUnderstand your audience better than they understand themselves. It takes a lot of upfront research, and often means being a member of the very tribe you’re trying to lead – but it pays off. Brian Clark, founder and CEO, CopybloggerUnderstanding your audience better means you’ll have a better idea of what blog content will resonate with them, which is a good start when you get to writing blog posts.A great technique for doing this is to simply ask your readers first on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn with an engaging quote. If people respond well to it, than this is probably a great topic to write about. An example for this comes from Andrew Chen who famously “tests” his blogpost ideas on Twitter first.And so does Joel here at Buffer. Take this example from a recent Twitter post of his, where he simply tweeted one quote to see how well people liked a topic before he blogged about it:3. Write for yourself firstWrite for yourself first & foremost. Ignore the fact that anyone else will read what you write; just focus on your thoughts, ideas, opinions and figure out how to put those into words. Write it and they will come. Adii Pienaar, founder of PublicBetaAdii’s experience in writing for himself firstly has made a difference to his blog in ways he didn’t expect:Yes, since I’ve been writing for myself, I’ve found that I write more and I publish more often. I think though that the main reason for that is that I don’t decide whether to publishing something based on the traction / reception that the post will receive within my audience; instead if I want to publish something, I do so. For myself.4. Build your email listStart building your email list from day one. Even if you don’t plan on selling anything, having an email list allows you to promote your new content to your audience directly without worrying about search rankings, Facebook EdgeRank, or other online roadblocks in communications. Kristi Hines, freelance writer and professional bloggerWhen you’re asking readers to sign up for your email list, you might want to try experimenting with different language. Willy Franzen found that his subscription rate jumped 254% higher when he changed his call-to-action from “subscribe by email” to “get jobs by email”:Using this phrase more clearly tells Willy’s readers what they’re signing up for, which clearly worked well!5. Love your existing readersLove the readers you already have. A lot of bloggers get quite obsessed with finding new readers – to the point that they ignore the ones they already have. Yes – do try to find new readers but spend time each day showing your current readers that you value them too and you’ll find that they will help you grow your blog. Darren Rowse, founder of ProBloggerFocusing on your readers is a great way to get to know them better (see tip #2). I love the way Daniel Burstein describes blog readers’ expectations of you as a blogger:A blog is really two things. One, simply a piece of technology, a platform. But, two, it is a promise in the minds of most readers, who expect that the blog should have actual content with some elements of value that is hyper-targeted to their needs. Much like with a newspaper. Readers don’t just look at a newspaper as newsprint that is delivered on their driveway every morning. They look at it as valuable information about their city, where they live, and the things that they do.6. Focus on building an amazing call-to-actionI screwed up for years. I’d blog and blog. Some of my posts were doing very well on places like Hacker News, but I had such hard time getting return visitors. And very few people bothered to follow me on Twitter. Don’t rely on people to do the work to find your Twitter account. Don’t rely on them to do the work to find your details in a sidebar. People are blind to sidebars. Thanks banner ads! Finish your blog post with some kind of call to action to signup for an email list or follow you on Twitter. When I started doing this, I immediately increased my Twitter followers by 335% in the first 7 days. Nate Kontny, founder of DraftNate uses a simple call-to-action on his blog now, that looks like this:This particular technique we’ve also tested here on the Buffer blog and found it to work amazingly well to bring attention to other blog posts we’ve written, like this:or to Buffer product features, like this:7. Give stuff awayGive away free content that adds value to people’s lives “until it hurts” and they will love you and become loyal fans. Jeff Bullas, blogger and author of Blogging the Smart WayA great example of this is the research done by Incentivibe, who found that adding a giveaway contest pop-up to the bottom-right of their website led to 125% more email subscribers.8. Be consistentConsistency is one of the most important things that bloggers tend to forget. It’s much easier to lose your traffic than it is to build it up, so make sure you consistently blog. Neil Patel, founder of KISSmetricsA study by Hubspot showed that consistent blogging actually leads to higher subscriber growth rates:Over a two-month span, businesses that published blog entries on a regular basis (more than once a week) added subscribers over twice as fast as those companies that added content once a month.9. Give away your knowledgeDon’t be afraid to showcase what you know. Too many bloggers hold back the good stuff out of fear of giving away the “secret sauce.” There is no secret sauce in a world where everyone has high speed Internet access at all times. Today, you want to give away information snacks to sell knowledge meals. Jay Baer, author of YoutilityJay’s advice is to share the knowledge you have, rather than keeping it tucked away for a rainy day. Chris Guillebeau follows this advice by offering two free, downloadable PDFs to his readers. Chris also does what Jay calls giving away “information snacks to sell knowledge meals.” On both of the free PDF download pages, Chris markets his book on the right-hand side.10. Be true to your voiceStay true to yourself and your voice. People don’t care to follow sites so much as they care to follow people. Chris Pirillo, founder and CEO, LockerGnomeAnother blogger who advocates the importance of the writer’s voice is Jeff Goins. He says that your voice is the most important, yet over-looked part of blogging:Writing isn’t about picking the right topic; it’s about finding the right voice. What matters, what readers really resonate with, isn’t so much what you say, but how.11. Give it time – This is whyPlan to invest in blogging for a long time before you see a return. The web is a big, noisy place and unless you’re willing to invest more over a greater period of time than others, you’ll find success nearly impossible. If you’re seeking short-term ROI, or a quick path to recognition, blogging is the wrong path. But if you can stick it out for years without results and constantly learn, iterate, and improve, you can achieve something remarkable. Rand Fishkin, CEO of MozRand shared these great images with us from his wife’s travel blog, Everywhereist, which shows just how long it can take to see a return on your efforts:12. Give your email list priorityIf you’re blogging to create a business, a movement, or to support a cause, then you need to build an email list. It’s not an option. I don’t even consider my blog to be my community, my email list is my community. Caring about these people, writing for them, and delivering value to them should be your number one goal. James Clear, entrepreneur, weightlifter and travel photographerWhen the New York Public Library focused on growing email subscription rates, this simple home page design with information about what readers could expect to receive boosted numbers by 52.8% over a more complicated version with less information about the actual newsletter:13. Write catchy headlinesNo matter how great your content is, it won’t matter unless you have an amazing headline. People have a split second to decide if they should click on your post, and your headline will make them decide. The headline is also essential in making it easy and desirable for people to share your post. Keep your headlines SPUB: simple, powerful, useful and bold. Dave Kerpen, author and CEO of Likeable LocalSomething we do at Buffer is to test several different headlines for each of our blog posts to determine which ones works best. Here’s an example of what that might look like:You can read more about this particular approach in more depth here: A scientific guide to writing great headlines on Twitter, Facebook and your Blog14. Be YourselfThere isn’t one specific set of rules to be successful in blogging. When I started blogging, I had the opportunity to learn from experienced and successful bloggers in the industry. One of the best lessons I’ve learned from them is to simply be me. I didn’t have to be too “professional” or use “big words” to impress others. I had to simply be me. By being me, I enjoyed writing and the process more. It had me writing more than I usually would too. If you look at the the most successful writers like Seth Godin and Chris Brogan you’ll notice that they are different and unique in their own ways. Aaron Lee, social media manager, entrepreneur and bloggerMoz CEO Rand Fishkin agrees that telling your company’s story is important, as opposed to following a formula for successful blogging:Emotion and storytelling have been part of how we communicate with each other and inspire action for thousands of years.15. Keep it shortBiggest lesson I learned in my past year of blogging. Keep it in the 1–2 minutes read-time length. Derek Sivers, founder of Wood EggWorking out the best length for your blog posts can be tricky. You generally need about 300 words minimum to get indexed by search engines, but otherwise the length of your post is up to what you think feels best.Derek Sivers noticed recently that his shorter posts were much better received by readers and seemed to be shared more, unlike his longer posts:When I’ve written articles that were too long or had too many ideas, they didn’t get much of a reaction. When I read books, I often feel bad for the brilliant idea buried on page 217. Who will hear it? Stop the orchestra. Solo that motif. Repeat it. Let the other instruments build upon it. The web is such a great way to do this. Present a single idea, one at a time, and let others build upon it.According to this Chartbeat graph below, many visitors to your site won’t bother scrolling, and most visitors won’t read more than about 60% of what you’ve written. Keeping it short and sharp then, could be worthwhile.If you’re looking for a general guide to blog post length, Joe Pulizzi’s blog post, “A blog post is like a miniskirt” might be useful:A blog post is like a miniskirt. It has to be short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the subject.16. Make it worth referencing – here is how:One thing I always try to keep in mind before publishing a post is would anyone want to “cite” this for any reason? Just like interesting research is great because it leaves you with a fascinating finding or an idea, I like for my posts to be the same. That doesn’t mean relying on research, but simply making sure each post has an original lesson or actionable item, making it “citable” on the web. Gregory Ciotti, marketing strategist at Help ScoutOur very own Buffer co-founder Leo has written about a similar thing before:When writing a post, I get into a mindset to answer just this 1 question with a Yes: “Would anyone email this article to a friend?” It’s an extremely simple proposition. Yet, it has changed my writing completely. If I put myself into a reader’s head going through a post and seeing whether someone will say “Oh, this is interesting, John will really like this”, then I go ahead and publish it. It’s almost like an invisible threshold to pass. I need to improve the post until this level is reached. I will iterate, find more research, get more examples, until I can truly imagine this happening.I’m sure there are lots more great tips out there about building a blog.

    "body": "ORGANIZED labor will file a petition for a new wage increase because of supervening conditions that will arise from the implementation of the new Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) Act effective January next year.The Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) on Wednesday said they would push for an amendment to the new tax reform law to include forward programs that would alleviate the plight of the most affected sectors through skills training, competency improvement and job windows.“We still don’t have the figures for our wage petition. We are still in the process of consultation. We will also study the impact of the expected increase in the prices of basic commodities and services on the [current]take-home pay of workers,” ALU-TUCP spokesman Alan Tanjusay said.Under the the law, a wage petition can only be filed a year after the latest wage increase granted by a particular Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB).The wage board is also mandated to act motu propio or on its own to make the necessary salary adjustments for workers.Tanjusay noted though that the RTWPBs have the habit of approving salary adjustments that do not jibe with the economic situation on the ground.He cited as an example the P21 increase (P184 was the original petition) granted to minimum wage earners in the the National Capital Region (NCR or Metro Manila) that took effect last October.Tanjusay pointed out that the law allows the filing of new wage petitions even less than a year after the last wage increase if there are supervening events, like series of increases in the prices of commodities and basic services.The group opposes the government’s plan to provide discount vouchers to the poor impacted by Train, saying it would only teach people to be lazy and dependent on someone else.It said it would be better if the government provides the poor with cash-for-work program beginning with skills training and competency improvement and providing them with jobs.“Once millions of people become idle and lazy, it’s not sustainable, not good for our nation-building. But if we capacitate the poor to level up and give them the work opportunities, they become productive for our country, for themselves and for their families,” Tanjusay said.He added that there are already government institutions such as the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and the Department of Labor and Employment to provide the training needed and the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Public Works and Highways to provide the job opportunities.“We do not have to reinvent the wheel. We already have government institutions and experts in the bureaucracy who can provide the needed capacity-building and the work opportunities for the program,” Tanjusay said.According to the group, around 15.6 million most vulnerable underground economy workers will suffer more once the Train takes effect.Informal economy workers are those independent, self-employed, small-scale producers and distributors of goods and services. These are the jeepney drivers, tricycle drivers, pedicab drivers, taxi drivers, all kinds of vendors, sales attendants, barbers, cooks, waiters, dishwashers in carinderias (small restaurants) and canteens, tailors, sewers, porters and street sweepers.Though the Train widened the base of those exempted from income tax from minimum wage earners to mid-level wage earners by exempting those employees getting P250,000 a year or P21,000 a month and raised taxable bonuses from P82,000 to P90,000, these cannot mitigate the impact of Train on the underground workers.The Train will also collect excise taxes on coal, sweetened beverages and fuel and its by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas used in household cooking once enforced, increasing prices of basic commodities and cost of services including costs of electricity and water utilities.",

    "body": "A particular video earned extreme hate from netizens as it showed documented and detailed procedure of a lethal injection.The video was called \"#DeathPenaltyFail: A Lethal Injection,\" and it lived up to its title. Lethal injection is one of the most common methods used as the death penalty for prisoners deemed \"too evil\" for society. It is implemented with the belief that it is the easiest and the most humane way to kill the person as it will only stop the heart from beating. They usually inject three drugs into the bloodstream-- sodium thiopental to make the prisoner unconscious, pancuronium bromide to paralyze the muscle and the respiratory system , and lastly , potassium chloride to finally stop the heart from beating.However, this very method has accumulated the highest botched procedures in inmates as of 2014. In fact, 2014 has been hailed as the worst year in the whole history of Lethal Injection in America. Contrary to its claim of being easy and painless, many of the lethal injection executions went wrong in some way, and turned into rather gruesome deaths.This video is one of the worst execution recorded where it was revealed that most of the prisons that conduct lethal injections, obtain their drugs from shady sources. Furthermore, most of the people involved in doing the procedure aren't even medically trained!The curtains were eventually drawn at the end of the video after it turned too brutal. Many netizens were angered and wished to junk death penalty.",

Mamamayang mapangabuso sa bayan ni Juan! Yan ang bansag sa mga bagong kabataan ng Unibeesidad ng Pilipinas! Nakakahiya kayo sa bansang sinilangan!” Netizen Harly Bale remarked“Yan ba ang produkto ng tax na binabayad ng taong bayan? Imbes na kung ano anong kalokohan ang gawin nyo tumanaw kayo ng utang na loob sa mga nag papaaral sa inyo sa pamamagitan ng pag babahagi ng inyong natutunan sa kursong napili nyo at tulungan ang bayan na umunlad.” Netizen Paolo Cordero said.“Akala ko UP mga sobrang bait ng mga estudyante..mabuti pa mga pupils ko kahit larawan lang kahit sinong Presidente,respetuhin nila..bakit ganun..nasaan na ba ang tinuturong VALUES EDUCATION sa atin..lalo na kayong taga UP ang talino daw..”MABUTI PANG HINDI MASYADONG MATALINO BASTA MAY RESPETO SA KAPWA TAO”. Teacher Eb-eb Nah Quo said.“Such a disgrace. Never thought that these supposed intellectuals are capable of such a mockery of themselves. If this is the result of freedom, then a dictatorship is beginning to sound appealing to me.” Netizen Jupiter Nacario said.Charles Kevin Absalon said that the reaction of the public on the 2017 lampoon edition of the Philippine Collegian proves how gullible are the Filipinos when it comes on reading satirical and fictional writings.“he said.Last year, Philippine Collegian parodied Mocha Uson in their 2016 lampoon edition.In 2011, a former editor-in-chief of the UP Baguio Outcrop, the official publication of U.P Baguio was charged by libel for its supposedly libelous article against a UPB journalist professor. The Baguio City RTC Branch 6 junked the libel case against the U.P Student in 2016.",

I searched for a publicly listed contact number for Jecsons Medical Center and dialed it. The hospital answered and they confirmed it.]November 28th FeverDate of VaccinationsNo Consent, No Waiver, No ExplanationsNo preliminary screeningImportant NoteDONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:Health Secretary Francisco Duque earlier said Dengvaxia provides a 30-month protective period before risk of severe dengue for recipients with no prior history of dengue kicks in. However, an interview with a mother from Tarlac suggests that such a \"protective period\" may not be entirely true.Yesterday, Facebook user Von Dy posted two photos of a young girl in what appears to be a hospital’s Intensive Care Unit, and part of the accompanying caption reads:I am generally doubtful of claims made by random people on Facebook, so I called one of the phone numbers listed in that post, and I got to speak with a certain Lejani Pangalangan, who claims to be Tamayo’s mother.Pangalangan said the doctor fears her child may be suffering from dengue, just three months after receiving her third shot of Dengvaxia in August 2017.Pangalangan said the child started to become feverish on November 28th but she was still able to attend a school competition the 29th, although she has already become weak and frail by then.After the family got home, Aimy’s cousin told Pangalangan that dengue is detectable only after three days, so she brought her daughter to the hospital on December 2nd to get her blood tested.She said, “Mababa na po yung platelet. Sabi ng doktor, ipa-admit na kasi nakaka-alarma dun sa barangay niyo ay marami nang na-dengue [Her platelet count was already low. The doctor said she should be admitted to the hospital because of the high prevalence of dengue in her barangay].”Pangalangan said Aimy’s platelet count is falling. It was 61 two days ago, 38 today, and the results of the latest test are still pending.She said, ”Doon sa lugar namin, kung hindi po ako nagkakamali, 30 na po yung na-dengue. Then, dalawang estudyante po na kaklase po niya ngayon ay nilalagnat, so naalarma po sila (mga guro) [If I’m not mistaken, there have been 30 dengue cases in my village and two and her classmates currently have fever, so the teachers are alarmed at the situation].”There’s a dengue outbreak in their village right now.Pangalangan said her daughter received 3 shots of the dengue vaccine as part of the mass immunization program of Department of Health, and that her daughter has no history of contracting the dengue virus.Aked if her daughter received Dengvaxia, she said, “Grade 6 po siya ngayon. Na-inject po siya ng ganon noong Grade 4 siya… two years ago [She’s in 6th grade right now. She got her first injection when she was in 4th Grade… two years ago].”The said program was launched in early 2016, which is only about a year and a half ago.Asked on the specific date of Aimy’s first dose, she said Aimy’s teacher texted her the specific dates of vaccination. After checking her inbox, she said Aimy received shots on 30 March 2016, 13 October 2016, and 14 August 2017.Pangalangan noted that in reality, the first dengue vaccine shot may have been administered a few days later: on April 4th, 5th, or 6th.Aimy was injected with Dengvaxia, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi’s newly-launched anti-dengue vaccine.She said she wasn’t notified about the vaccination program. She said she wasn’t made to sign anything, and nothing was explained to her by any school official.“Actually po, noong sinasaksakan sila, hindi po namin alam (We actually didn’t know they got vaccinated until they did),” Pangalangan said.Pangalangan added, “Nagulat na lang po ako noong umuwi po iyong isang anak ko, sabi niya, ‘Ma, si Ate, nagpa-inject pero kami, hindi.’ (I was shocked when one of my kids came home and said, ‘Mom, my elder sister was vaccinated but we weren’t).”Pangalangan asked her younger child what was injected, and the child said it was an anti-dengue vaccine. “Natuwa pa po ako, anti-dengue pala, e di maganda siya… Sino ba naman po ang hindi matutuwa e anti-dengue po pala? (I was actually pleasantly surprised because it was anti-dengue, so it’s good for her… Who wouldn’t be glad that she got anti-dengue vaccine?),” Pangalangan said.She had no idea how the vaccine works because nothing was explained to her. That is, until her elder daughter Aimy was hospitalized a few days ago.Dengvaxia is effective on recipients who have had dengue. However, if injected on persons with no prior history of dengue, the vaccine may worsen the disease at the first natural infection, i.e. through a mosquito bite. Thus, preliminary testing for presence of dengue antibodies in a prospective recipient is key, as doing so would determine if Dengvaxia would be appropriate to administer.Aimy was never tested prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. Moreover, Pangalangan said there was no preliminary screening done to Aimy or any of her classmates.She said all of Aimy’s 4th grade batchmates were vaccinated.“Hindi ko naman po sinisisi ang mga teacher kasi iniisip nila kapakanan ng bata… unang-una po, utos ng DoH (I don’t blame the teachers because they only want what’s best for the kids… in the first place, it was an order from the Deparment of Health),“ Pangalangan added.With Ms. Pangalangan's permission, I published a recording of our entire phone call b elow:This entire article was largely based on the initial Facebook post and this phone call interview. Hence, I still need to visit the facility myself to more thoroughly verify the situation.And that’s what I will do. [ ",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Thursday, March 31st, 2016Manila, Philippines – In a surprising move, ‘Pork Barrel Queen’ Janet Lim-Napoles released a statement today endorsing presidential candidate Jejomar Binay, describing him as a ‘role model’ and deserving to be the next president of the Philippines.The statement and endorsement was released through Napoles’ public relations officer Atty Natalie Sod. In the statement, Napoles stated that she is endorsing and will be supporting the presidential bid of Vice President Jejomar Binay. She cited Binay’s exemplary accomplishments in finance, and expert ability to amass exorbitant amounts of untraceable fortune.Napoles also stated that she has always looked up to Binay’s leadership and example, and hope that when he wins the elections, that Binay would implement his financial system into congress and educated everyone on how it is done the right way. Napoles went on as far as offering her services as a consultant where her skills can be utilized, particularly in dealing with individuals in the Philippine congress.Meanwhile, Binay’s camp were ecstatic at this new development. Binay’s campaign manager Akoy Kasabuat said that they were not expecting someone like Napoles to come out and publicly endorse their candidate. “She is the epitome of a financial wizard, and we certainly welcome her huge endorsement and will look forward to her support in the coming months.”, Kasbuat said. Kasabuat also said that if Binay wins, then President Binay would certainly repay all his supporters and will consider appointing many of them into government positions. “Napoles would be a good fit with something that deals with finance or auditing”, he adds.Janet “Jenny” Luy Lim-Napoles (born January 15, 1964) is a businesswoman who have expertly managed the disbursement of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) for the Philippine Senators Juan Ponce Enrile, Bong Revilla, Jinggoy Estrada and certain members of the House of Representatives.The camps of Presidential aspirants Grace Poe, Mar Roxas, Rodrigo Duterte and Miriam Santiago declined to comment as of the writing of this article.",

The two became a thing after they were witnessed seeing the film “Wonder Woman” together earlier in the month. Since then, the two have outed their special relationship to the public, with the actor even inviting the young star as his date to the “Star Magic Ball 2017“.While they have yet to take their relationship to the next level, Janine’s mom Lotlot de Leon is excited with what’s to come for the two. In an interview with PEP, the seasoned actress admitted that she likes Rayver for her daughter.“Mabait si Rayver. I’ve known him since he was fourteen [years old]. “Matagal ko nang kakilala ang batang ‘yan, and I’ve worked with him already. “We had a show in ABS-CBN, and almost every day magkasama kami niyan. “So, kilala ko ‘yan.”Lotlot and Rayver worked together for the old fantasy TV series “Spirits”. Having known him for long, the actress was happy to know that it was Rayver who’s interested in her daughter.“Actually, natuwa ako, kasi kilala ko nga siya, e. “And I know he’s sincere. Sincere siyakung anuman ang pakay niya. “Hindi naman para bilugin pa ang ulo ko o ano. Hindi ganun, e.”The “Ipaglaban Mo!” star also jested that she hopes for Janine to accept the actor as her boyfriend.But on a lighter note, Lotlot said that while she’s open to her daughter having a love life, she doesn’t want to intervene with Janine’s decisions.“Pero, at the end of the day, it boils down to her decision. “Whatever she decides, nandito lang kami to support her decision.”What can you say about Lotlot de Leon being in favor of Rayver Cruz for her daughter Janine Gutierrez? Do you think that Rayver and Janine will soon take it to the next level? Let us know your thoughts and reactions down in the comments section!",

You’re old enough to be a grandfather. But I can’t help it. This is what you bring out in me, what you bring out in every person you touch with your words. You are a madman, wild and drunk with power and you are unstoppable.You always need to be the man on top. Wolf-whistling a female journalist (would you do it to a male one, I wonder? C’mon, haven’t you ever wondered what it’s like to get it from behind?) to make a joke at her expense, to make her feel uncomfortable and unsafe? To annoy and insult her husband – just because you think you can. Just because you cannot pass up a chance to show that you’re the man.I imagine you watching from your throne as the country tears itself apart. Filipino against Filipino, all in the name of Digong. Some screaming, “Digong, yes!” Others chanting, “Digong, no!”You like that, don’t you? You like it rough. You like it dirty.You need to show that you’ve earned the nickname “The Punisher” even if, by your own admission, you need to pop a Viagra pill first to do it.Oh, have I insulted you? Or have I flattered you?Like you, I won’t take back anything I’ve said. You shouldn’t take things too seriously. I’m just being playful, Digong. You already know how this game of mindfucking is played. You started it. But trust me when I say that you’re not the only one who’s good at it. – Rappler.comSource: RapplerCommentscomments",

    "body": "Metro Manila, like any major city, can be dangerous. As such, it is definitely prone to different kinds of scenarios and encounters. One such netizen claimed that a modus operandi has been allegedly gaining ground throughout the city.According to her, it is targetting Grab and Uber drivers. Apparently, even users of technology are not immune to syndicates and scams as well. As of this writing, her post has reached 10,000 likes, 6,287 shares, and 3,100 comments.Here is an excerpt of her post:“My driver informed me that last Monday, Oct 16, two passengers booked a ride in Cubao going to Otis. The pair declared a hijack by Nagtahan, and asked the driver to step out–taking the car, his earnings and his gadgets.” “Upon reporting the incident, it was found out that the pair has set up a fake account and are now untraceable.”She stated that some drivers of Grab and Uber are now asking valid identification cards (IDs) from their passengers to see if they were really the ones who booked the ride.They also believed that the ones behind the modus operandi may also plan to target users of Uber Pool and Grab Share since they have more passengers in the vehicle.The netizen claimed that this might make it a scenario of “hitting two birds with one stone” since all passengers in the ride would be affected, apart from the driver.According to her, people should look out for the welfare of the Grab and Uber drivers since they provide people with a clean, comfortable, and convenient type of transportation.As such, they should also be protected – so to speak – from ill-intentioned people behind the alleged modus operandi. The netizen ended with the following words:“As for the ride sharing platforms, hope they can find a way to update their product design to ensure the identification of both riders and drivers are valid.”One of the ways to prevent such modus is to ask riders to identify themselves to the driver once they board the vehicle. They could also show proof of this through their respective IDs, be it a company or a school ID.Read her full post below:Here are the netizens’ comments about the supposed modus:What do you think of this alleged modus operandi targeting Grab and Uber drivers? Do you use Grab or Uber regularly? If so, please be careful in your commute always! Let us know your thoughts and opinions about this story in the comments section below!SOURCE: Facebook/[REDACTED]",

Hostilities have intensified following the formal termination of government’s peace talks with the Communist group.According to the report, her name is Josephine Anne Lapira, a 22-years-old student in UP Manila, taking BS Biochemistry.Lapira is also a Deputy Secretary General of Gabriela in the said school. She died last November 28 in Batangas because of being an alleged member of communist group and a wrong belief about her group that they are fighting for their country.In a blog post of Mr. Alon Calinao Dy, he said, “I don’t understand why a famous school like University of the Philippines allowed students to be the members of the communist group. I think, in the first place, the school should have screened every student about their social activities.”How many more lives of students will be killed because they are members of a wrong organization like NPA? I think every rally that is going to be organized by Gabriela or other communist groups should not be allowed anymore since they are sympathizers of the NPA who are against government forces.",

Nieto stated that Avancena just finished watching Miss Saigon in Broadway when Tagala rudely questioned her purpose in visiting New York and even asked who paid for her trip!Not being used to media exposure, Avancena got rattled so her protocol officers tried to prevent Tagala from asking more questions. Seemed disappointed, this ABS CBN correspondent continued shouting at Avancena and stated that they are in the US and they could not stop them from filming her.This act has been questioned by Nieto and even asked if ABS CBN would have done this if it was Ming Ramos or Loi Ejercito.

Shortly after, the video garnered over 421,917 views on the site and drew flak from the netizens who saw what happened.At the beginning of said video, two Caucasian males were seen partying with two Chinese girls and another Chinese male. Later on we can see one of the girl on the space separating the Chinese boyfriend and foreigner, the latter being was seen already holding hands. The clip shifted then to the moment where the girl, while busy talking to her phone, was sitting on the lap of the foreigner and holding hands with the Chinese guy simultaneously.During this scene, the girl and the American was caught kissing in between while her Chinese boyfriend was looking away. After the Chinese guy saw what the girl was doing, he appeared dumbfounded and confused.Finally, the girl and her Chinese boyfriend were separated as the girl’s friend stepped in, leaving the Chinese more at a loss.The story ended with the Hong Kong girl and the American guy walking away hand-in-hand.According to Shanghai website Shanghaiist.com, the setting of the viral video was in the bar district of Lan Kwai Fong in Hong Kong.Netizens from the West were easy to ridicule this scenario with the Asians – saying that Hong Kong girls were “western-worshipping”, while guys were “impotent”.Not surprisingly, the infamous video led to discussions about race.In reference to Edward Said‘s Orientalism, a netizen claimed that the event stems from the West’s long-term sexual views on Asian women, saying that it “is not an individual choice nor an isolated case”.Another offended commentator laid down the facts.“Liking westerners is a personal choice but having westerners objectify Asian women is just colonialism.”In a discussion from the HK Golden Forum, a user was curious to know what would happen if the situation was reversed.“what if the roles were reversed and a Hong Kong guy picked up a western girl, what would everyone’s reaction be then?”You can watch the full video here.What are your thoughts and reactions to this unbelievable video?

A dark-skinned model named Nyakim Gatwech is here to tell you that such is not the case.She’s a model from Sudan who famously turned down $10,000 (approximately PHP 502,000) to make her skin whiter. According to Huffington Post, an Uber driver offered to give her the money to bleach her skin. The model laughed it off and said on Instagram:“Why on earth would I ever bleach this beautiful melanin God [blessed] me with. You won’t believe the kind of questions I get and the kind of looks I get for having this skin.”Ever since, Nyakim Gatwech has been called the “Queen of Dark” by her fans and supporters. She shared on the mentioned social media platform:“I actually like the name there is nothing wrong with darkness and [being called a] queen is just Cherry on the top.

Based on the report, Nyakim uses Instagram to share inspirational posts of self-acceptance and loving oneself.She has redefined the typical standards of beauty with her stunning shots, showing that black skin is just as beautiful as fair-skinned complexion.Nyakim wrote in one of her posts, “MY EBONY SKIN STAY GLOWING. I AM BLACK WITHOUT APOLOGY!!”In another of her posts, she said:“We’ve come a long way but we still have a long way to go. My hope is that this post can remind you everyday of why you should be proud of your melanin.” “Why you should be proud of your heritage regardless of how light or dark your skin is. Stop comparing your skin [to] anyone.” “Change can only happen once you can truthfully look in the mirror and love that Deep Chocolate, Cinnamon, Mocha, or Caramel complexion.”Nyakim emphasized that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and continued:“My chocolate is elegant. So is what I represent. I represent a nation of warriors. You can see it in my presentation. MaMa Africa. My roots run deep!”Way to go, Nyakim Gatwech!What do you think of her posts?

E bakit hindi nila ampunin lahat ng adik jan kung gusto nila?” Duterte said referring to the Catholic priests.The President also hit the Church over its comment on the 15 NPA rebels killed in Batangas during a military operation last week.Kung gusto nila e di sumama sila sa operation. Yan, sila ng CHR, magsama sama sila para pag tinamaan sila ng bala ng mga NPA e di sorry”, Duterte mocking both the CHR and CBCPito kasing mga paring ito, walang ibang alam kungdi ang maki-alam. E kung magbayad kaya sila ng tax sigurado pakikinggan ko pa sila;. Payag ba kayo singilin natin ng tax ang mga pari?” Duterte asked his audience who responded with big round of applause.“Pag hindi sila tumigil sa pakikialam talagang sisingilan ko ng tax ang mga abuloy nila”, he added.The CBCP is one of the staunchest critics of the President’s war on drugs that resulted to thousands of casualties since it was implemented right after he won as president last year.Since the anti-drug operation has been returned to the PNP, anti-Duterte groups are again saying that casualties will multiply any time soon.",

He then climbed the gate only to see his mother-in-law, wife, and children massacred in their home.On June 28 , one of the suspects of the Bulacan massacre, 26-year-old Carmelo Ibanez , was arrested. Following his apprehension, he confessed to committing the heinous crime.Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr. , Bulacan police director, asked him why he did such a thing. Ibañez, a construction worker, said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN:“Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok.”Of the 5 victims of the Bulacan massacre, 2 women were r*ped by Ibañez and his two other companions, Tony and Inggo .According to Ibañez, the three suspects collectively did P150 worth of shabu during their drinking session before they decided to go to the Carlos residence to murder the people living there. When asked why they also killed the children, he simply said he didn’t know that there were any. He said:“Hindi po namin alam na may bata doon, ano na po kasi sa droga… Iyung mga bata, nakaka-meet ko rin po iyun. Minsan po kasi, nanood iyun sa kabila, sa ano ng ate ko, bahay.”He then asked the family to forgive him for what he had done. Ibañez said:“Ako po ang pumatay sa kanilang lahat. Nagsisi po ako sa ginawa ko po. Sana po ay mapatawad po ako kasi po lulong po ako sa droga saka po sa alak po. Pasensya na po kayo.”Watch ABS-CBN’s full interview with the suspect below:",

Lopez said.ALSO READ: ‘Goodbye Bombay!’: ‘5-6’ lending scheme new focus of Duterte gov’tPriority beneficiaries include micro-enterprises and entrepreneurs that do not have easy access to credit, or are accessing credit at very high cost, such as, micro-entrepreneurs, market vendors, agri-businessmen and members of cooperatives, industry associationsand co-operators.Loanable amount per end-borrower can range from PhP 5,000.00 for start-ups to PhP 300,000.00, with maximum interest rate of 26% per annum with no collateral requirement. This rate is significantly below the 20% per day/ week/ month charged by “5-6” lenders. It is also lower than what is charged by most MFIs.MFIs may opt for portfolio guarantee cover of up to 15% of their P3 loan portfolio from SB Corp at a guarantee fee of 0.4%. The guarantee feature is seen to help MFIs address theP3 Program’s inherent risk. The guarantee fund will be sourced from the P3 fund.P3 allocates PhP 100 million for direct lending by SB Corp. Target loan beneficiaries are the small enterprises in priority and emerging industries, start-up businesses and technology innovators.Minimum loan amount will be PhP 300,000.00 with interest rate capped at 10% p.a., with or without collateral cover.ALSO READ: ‘Goodbye Bombay!’: ‘5-6’ lending scheme new focus of Duterte gov’t“This alternative funding dedicated for micro and small enterprises is meant to discourage the 5-6 money lending system in our country,” said Sec.

Children go to school just because they have to, not because they want to learn. Some teachers act the same way, without thinking of the impact they have on the students. But if we really think about it, there would be no professionals without teachers. Teachers do not merely teach us academics, but also guide and teach us the most important things in life. Without our teachers, how would our world function?Loading...23-year-old Maricris Llaguno is a teacher at the San Jose Elementary School, and she has inspired many teachers out there with her story. She wakes up very early in the morning just to drive her motorcycle for 20kms just to get to the said school. The long ride can be tiring, but seeing the faces of the little children waiting for her seems to liven up her day.At the end of the day, she has to travel the same distance and gets home just in time for sleep. According to her, she has to pass by 20 barangays and one light, wooden bridge spanning the water. Apparently, before there was the wooden bridge, she had to cross the river with a small boat.By showing the children how she sacrifices so many things just to give them a good education, the children understand that sacrifices has its rewards. While many students and teachers around the world have cozy classrooms and adequate facilities, Llaguno and her students enjoy the simplicity of reading books together.Llaguno is also a multi-grade teacher, even teaching two classes at simultaneously at times. She sometimes leaves one classroom to a “little teacher,” who is quite advanced than the other readers. According to the website Definitely Filipino, Teacher Maricris is almost on her third year of teaching—starting her career immediately after she graduated from Bicol University in 2014.WATCH THE STORY VIDEO BELOWLoading...Commentscomments",

    "body": "In long-term relationships, stories of couples eventually breaking up because of money matters are not unheard of. Unresolved conflicts over unequal expenses and earnings often result in bitter fights between couples, with their respective families taking sides in a marital spate. Not to mention the endless debate between the husband and wife in regards to whom is responsible for household expenses. But for celebrity couple Solenn Heussaff and Nico Bolzico, there’s a simple solution to any household financial woes: handle your own finances.Speaking to entertainment website PEP on the sidelines of Preview Best Dressed Ball, Solenn shared a pro-tip: “Our finances are separate since day one!”According to the Kapuso artist, their financial arrangement might be considered “very modern”, but admittedly works for the two of them.“I don’t know how much he owns. He doesn’t know how much I own,” she remarked.“Very separate, very individual… We have a joint bank account for house dues, just for me to pay like groceries or stuff like that,” Solenn explained.“But aside from that, I don’t know how much he earns. He doesn’t know how much I earn,” the model-actress quipped.While others may be surprised with this unusual agreement, Solenn thinks otherwise and explains the rationale behind their decision.“It’s none of my business. I mean, we both work. For me, it’s none of my business,” she said.But the former Encantadia star acknowledged the possibility that their arrangement could change if they have a baby.“When we have a kid, maybe it will change. But for now, it’s chill,” she shared.According to the KAMI report, the sexy actress and her businessman husband tied the knot in 2016 after they started dating back in 2012.However, the pair will not be together for Christmas since Nico will fly to Argentina to ring in the holidays with his immediate family. Although Solenn wanted to join him, the actress could only wish because of her showbiz engagements.“Dapat pupunta rin ako. It’s part of my duty rin as a wife,” Solenn Heussaff said.“Pero nu’ng makita ko yung mga gagawin ko for next year, sabi ko kay Nico na it’s not yet time. May one week off ako, pero papuntang Argentina, 30 hours na yung trip. Not worth it na nandu’n lang ako ng four days,” she was quoted as saying in an Inquirer Bandera report.What do you think of Solenn Heussaff and Nico Bolzico’s financial arrangement?

    "body": "For once, Vic Sotto is breaking ”tradition” for Talitha, his month-old daughter with wife Pauleen Luna.Usually, Vic and partner (this time Pauleen) would leave for abroad for a much-needed break from the holidays, especially now that he is back in running at the 2017 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) with Meant To Beh (with a new director for a change, Chris Martinez; co-produced by Vic’s own company M-Zet Productions with OctoArts Films and APT Entertainment), a feel-good domestic comedy that reunites him with Dawn Zulueta more than two decades after they starred in the fantasy TV series Okey Ka,Fairy Ko.“Pauleen and I cannot travel yet because Talitha is still an infant, masyado pang maliit,” Vic told Funfare in a one-on-more. “Hindi naman puwedeng kaming dalawa lang because Pauleen might suffer from separation anxiety. Last week when Eat, Bulaga! celebrated its Christmas party, Pauleen was there but she was in a hurry. Gusto nang umuwi kaagad dahil nami-miss daw niya si Talitha.”Being breastfed by Pauleen, Baby Talitha sleeps in a crib attached to her parents’ bed.“Mabait si Talitha,” said Vic. (The baby was named after a baby girlbrought back to life by Jesus. Talitha is an Aramaic word that means Little Girl.) Hindi siya iyakin pero maingay. When she wakes up, she stretches her body and makes a sound na parang naghihikab,ahhhhh!!! She has to be fed every two hours.”Asked who does the changing of the diaper, Vic said it had to be Pauleen.Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1“Ako lang taga-bili ng diapers,” he joked. “Actually, it’s easy to change the diapers. You just tape here and tape there, ayos na. What’s tricky is cleaning the baby when she makes poo-poo or makes wee-wee.”The couple wasn’t able to celebrate Pauleen’s 29th birthday last Nov. 9 because she was in the hospital recuperating from delivering Talitha by Caesarian section three days earlier (Nov. 6). Because Pauleen is a Marian devotee (and so is Vic), they added Maria as the baby’s second first name (Talitha Maria Luna Sotto). There’s also a Maria in Talitha’s parents’ names — Marvic Sotto and Marie Pauleen Luna.On Christmas Eve, Vic and Pauleen will celebrate with Vic’s other children and their families: Danica and husband Marc Pingris and their two children; Oyo Boy and wife Kristine Hermosa and their four children; Paulina and her husband; and Pasig City Councilor Vico. Christmas Day is reserved for the in-laws or with the other Sottos reuniting at the home of Sen. Tito Sotto and wife Helen Gamboa in White Plains, Quezon City.Asked how many more children did he and Pauleen plan (or hope) to have, Vic said, “It depends. If none, OK na rin. We leave it all to God kung ilan ang ibigay Niya sa amin.”…with Bae-by Baste, one of his co-stars in his 2017 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) entry, Meant To BehMeanwhile in Meant To Beh, chubby-cheeked five-year-old Bae-by Baste (born Sebastian Benedict Granfon) is out to prove that he’s more than just a cute little face on television and that his time has come to be in showbiz spotlight.“He delivered all his lines and gave us a very good performance. Baste will surprise everyone because in this movie, he was able to do everything — from singing, dancing, acting to comedy. He’s a natural born entertainer,” said direk Chris.Vic, who took the kid under his wing since the latter joined show business over two years ago, added that considering his age and that he is still learning to read, Baste was able to deliver what was asked of him. He said the five-year-old was able to grasp the concept of making a movie and is already conscious of what acting is all about.“At first, we were just thinking that he would just say a few lines and do minimal acting because he’s never had experience shooting a movie. He’s used to what we do in Eat, Bulaga! that we just let him sing. I was really surprised. We were all surprised that he has a talent in acting even if he still cannot read the script.”Credit also goes to Baste’s mother, Shiela, who tirelessly read the script and practiced her son on how to deliver and act his lines correctly. She said it was difficult at first, especially when Baste had a hard time pronouncing long Tagalog words, but everyone in the production had been patient about it.“I had to act the script myself because he cannot read yet and will just copy what I will do. I think the pressure was more on me than on him because we have limited time. He also doesn’t want to commit mistakes while filming it,” she said.Mommy Shiela and Baste have been inseparable since they moved to Manila from General Santos City almost three years ago.(E-mail reactions at entphilstar@yahoo.com.

The connection between having paved roads and peace was not yet clear for so many. But now it is very clear – without roads opportunities cannot get in. Without the Sulu Circumferential road majority of the 80 percent farmers and fishermen in Sulu are isolated from opportunities for economic development, social services and hope.But things are changing for the better in Sulu.

He’s also known as a vocal defender of the Aquino administration.The musician earlier admitted in interviews that he moved to Australia with his family in 1998—when then-President Joseph Estrada assumed office— because he had given up on the Philippines.But in a 2014 interview with Philippine Star columnist Ching Alano, Paredes said he’s living alone in the Philippines now while his family are still in Australia.“My two kids like it there, they’re already dual citizens.

The incident caused a major stir, but the senator failed to prove the validity of his accusations when he failed to name his source, and BPI denied his record, calling it “fake”.Supporters are urging the mayor not to trust Trillanes because he is “paid bounty hunter and an attack dog”.Sen.

    "body": "SUPREME Court Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-De Castro and Court administrator Midas Marquez testified at the justice committee hearing of the House of Representatives for almost seven hours. The said testimonies may have inflicted irreparable damage to Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno, and sealed Sereno’s fate in the impending impeachment.Justice de Castro’s testimony detailed how Sereno undermined not only the internal rules of the high court, but also the Constitution. Of course, the allies of CJ Sereno to the rescue and saying about the issue as a product of hearsay evidence.Today, it seems Sereno went to a church celebration and had a privilege to speak in front of his supporters and family members using a couple of verses from God. It seems that she’s telling about the Justice of love and speaking against the government’s war on drugs that result to violence.In a blog post of Mr. Alon Calinao Dy, he said, “ that’s the problem of people who have committed sins against the people. The only time they realize that they need God is the moment that they are in trouble. Let’s be honest here, many Filipinos have been raped and victimized by the criminals, but the due process that the victims’ families is ongoing for haven’t been given immediately because there’s a problem with our justice. I am not saying everyone, but some judges have been bribed already.”The defenders of CJ Sereno had been saying that Justice de Castro has a grudge against Sereno because she had been bypassed when President Noynoy Aquino appointed Sereno who was a more junior member as chief justice. They’ve been trying to put an image to the Filipino people that Castro is very jealous to the position of Sereno.Trying to ruin Justice de Castro’s reputation because she spoke up the truth is something below the belt and very unprofessional manner. The controversial issues here are Sereno’s earnings with a large amounts of US$745,000 from the government as legal fees for the PIATCO case. This amount was not reported in her SALN or to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.Second, Sereno “used public funds to finance her extravagant and lavish lifestyle” by having the SC purchase a 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser worth PHP5 million. She ordered its bullet-proofing but “withdrew when news of her impending impeachment broke out.”Third, she traveled with her “coterie of security” and two motorcycle escorts. She insists on flying herself, her security and “her clique of relatively new hired lawyers” on business class for domestic and international travel, and gives herself and her staff travel allowances from SC funds.Fourth, she stayed in the Presidential Villa of Shangri-la Boracay during a 2016 conference, allegedly worth PHP200,000 a night. She holds meetings in 5-star hotels and clubs.All these controversial issues that were leaked around social media should be answered by Sereno personally, and if these allegations are said to be true, then she is at risk of losing her position.Source: Inquirer.net",

Because at year’s end, the phenomenon of powerful men being knocked off their perches by allegations of sexual misconduct — in Hollywood, on morning television, in chic restaurant kitchens, in the U.S. Senate — showed no signs of slowing. Each morning, we awoke to ask: “Who’s next?”To that question, we should also add, “What next?” Because as the year drew to a close, many were also wondering just how deep and lasting the change would prove, going forward. Was this, indeed, the cultural earthquake many have called it? Or was there a chance it might all eventually slip away?“We can’t be sure,” says Gloria Steinem. “But what I CAN be sure of is that this is the first time I’ve seen women being believed.” And that, says the feminist author, “is profoundly different.”Whatever forces had been stirring under the surface, it all burst into the open with an October scoop in the New York Times, a story alleging shocking misconduct by Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but he has apologized for causing “a lot of pain” with “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past.” (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File)The powerful producer’s misbehavior had long been the subject of whispers, but it was actress Ashley Judd who finally gave a well-known name to the allegations—a crucial launching point for what followed.Her account of a hotel-room encounter in which Weinstein asked her to give him a massage or watch him shower sounded familiar to many others, who were inspired in the ensuing days to come forward with their own allegations against Weinstein, from harassment to assault to rape. To date, some 80 women have come forward; Weinstein still denies all nonconsensual sex.‘Me too’Then came the tweet heard round the world.Alyssa Milano arrives at the Sixth Biennial UNICEF Ball at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel on January 12, 2016 in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)“If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too’ as a status,” actress/activist Alyssa Milano tweeted on Oct. 15, “we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” Then she went to bed.“I couldn’t have been in bed more than eight hours because I’m a mom,” Milano says now.When she awoke, tens of thousands had taken up the #MeToo hashtag (a phrase introduced 10 years ago by social activist Tarana Burke.)Less than 10 days later, Milano tweeted that more than 1.7 million people in 85 countries had used the hashtag.“The thing that was so surprising was the sheer magnitude and the quickness of how it happened,” Milano says. But she feels conditions had been ripe for a good year.It began, she says, with the election of President Donald Trump, who had bragged openly about groping women. On top of that came some aggressive investigative reporting—she cites Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker—and the domino effect of women emboldening each other to come forward. Public fascination with anything Hollywood didn’t hurt either.“For this to have taken off the way it did, it had to be a perfect storm and we had to be ready,” she says.Even before #MeToo happened, and just a few days after the Weinstein story broke, Anita Hill was sure something significant was happening.“I think we need something to push the needle and I think this has done it,” said Hill, a symbol of the fight against sexual harassment ever since her 1991 Senate testimony against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.Still, she noted, it was a lot easier for Hollywood stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie to speak out than it was for ordinary women experiencing harassment from their bosses.But Hill, who for years has been living a quiet academic life at Brandeis University, stressed that the next step has to be more than just conversation: “We now have to start putting into place measures at schools and workplaces and the military … about how people should be treated, and we have to enforce them.” Hill has just been named to a new commission on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry.READ: Major Hollywood media players start commission for sexual misconductAs the weeks went on, the accusers multiplied, and so did the accused, from Hollywood (Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Brett Ratner, Dustin Hoffman) to the news business (top morning hosts Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer) to the music world (Russell Simmons) to politics (Sen. Al Franken, Alabama candidate Roy Moore) to the food world (Mario Batali).This combination photo shows, top row from left, Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner, Louis C.K., Distin Hoffman, and bottom row from left, former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., former “Today” morning co-host Matt Lauer and former “CBS This Morning” co-host Charlie Rose, all of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/file)The accused lost jobs, TV shows, book deals, a Senate seat — with dizzying speed (Spacey was even erased from a completed movie.)Some simply apologized, while others fought back — like Simmons, with his hashtag #NotMe.Some apologies were more effective than others. Spacey drew flak for deciding to come out as gay as he apologized for unwanted sexual advances; Batali was scorned for appending to his email-blast apology a recipe for Pizza Dough Cinnamon Rolls.READ: Mario Batali draws flak for placing holiday recipe in same email as apology on sexual misconduct allegationsA few voices called for differentiating between levels of sexual misconduct. It didn’t always go over well. When Matt Damon said “I just think we have to start delineating between what these behaviors are,” Milano replied on Twitter that there are various stages of cancer, “but it’s still cancer.”Not to be forgotten were the accusers who decided not to come forward with their names, many out of fear of retaliation.Attorney Gloria Allred, who held news conferences with some Weinstein accusers, said there were many more she’d spoken to who have not yet gone public.And what about the alleged abusers we’ve never heard of because they’re not famous?“There have been stunning accounts of farm workers harassed in the field, factory workers on lines, restaurant workers,” says law professor Catharine MacKinnon, who decades ago pioneered the legal claim that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination.“They don’t have the high-profile man … but I’m telling you, to the women he does it to, he’s plenty big.”Still, says MacKinnon, of the University of Michigan and Harvard law schools, “any time any victim is believed, it’s a miracle.”And that’s why the events of late 2017 have been unprecedented. “It’s amazing to me that people are being believed and listened to and responded to, and their accounts being acted on,” she says.“That’s never happened before in the history of the world.”And to those who might still doubt there is tangible change, MacKinnon points out the remarkable sight of “white upper-class men deserting white upper-class men, in droves. We’ve never seen that before, ever. They feel they can no longer afford to be associated with this. THIS is cultural change. THIS is real social change.” NVGRELATED STORIES:Time honors ‘Silence Breakers’‘#MeToo’: Yes, there are sexual predators everywhere—even in familiesWeinstein’s Impact: List of men accused of sexual misconduct in various industries",

(Derek Stoffel/CBC)This latest round of tensions began after two Israeli police officers were shot and killed in the early hours of July 14. Three Arab citizens of Israel smuggled the weapons used in the killings into the al-Aqsa compound. The three men were shot dead by Israeli security forces.New measures revive old tensionsIsraeli authorities responded by installing metal detectors and security cameras outside some of the gates to the religious site, located in Jerusalem’s Old City.But Palestinians — including East Jerusalemites, residents of the West Bank and those with Israeli citizenship — banded together to demonstrate against what they believed to be an attempt by Israel to change the status quo, the delicate set of rules that govern access to the site, which is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, and the Temple Mount to Jews.Israel erected metal detectors outside several entrances to the al-Aqsa/Temple Mount compound following the killing of two Israeli police officers near the site on July 14. (Reuters)“[Israel] think[s] they can take more control over the people. We are the people and we give our souls to God,” said Mohammad Rabiya, a resident of the Old City.“Israel should keep their hands off of us and leave us alone,” he said.Israel removed the cameras and metal detectors last week, after diplomatic efforts that involved the United Nations, the United States, Jordan and other Muslim Arab nations.Protests against the Israeli security measures at the al-Aqsa compound sometimes turned violent. This masked Palestinian man faced off against Israeli security forces in the West Bank. (Mohamad Torokman/Reuters)As tensions flared, violence broke out alongside many of the demonstrations. Four Palestinians died in clashes with the Israeli security forces, while three members of an Israeli family were, according to Israeli authorities, stabbed to death by an attacker who wrote on Facebook he was acting to protect the al-Aqsa mosque.Potent Palestinian symbolThe demonstrations were about much more than security equipment. The al-Aqsa mosque is a potent national symbol for Palestinians, signalled by the fact many Palestinian families hang pictures on their walls showing a visit to the famous golden Dome of the Rock.Palestinians gambled on a strategy of protests through prayer after Israel brought in the new measures.Israeli policemen stand guard as Palestinian men recently take part in Friday prayers outside Jerusalem’s Old City. (Ammar Awad/Reuters)Religious leaders urged worshippers to refuse to pass through the metal detectors and instead spread their prayer mats down on the stone streets of the Old City.They did, and what followed was the most successful popular protest by East Jerusalemites in decades.Life in limboEast Jerusalem has long been at the heart of Palestinian ambition, the city where they wish to establish the capital of their future state. But it’s become a place where national pride and passion has disintegrated after years of neglect.Jerusalem’s 320,000 Palestinians make up nearly 40 per cent of the city’s population. But most feel disenfranchised, caught in limbo between Israel and the West Bank, with many feeling ignored by the Palestinian Authority.East Jerusalem residents pay taxes, but they complain about the services — or lack thereof — they receive in return.Litter-strewn streets highlight the absence of garbage collection, which pales in comparison to waste disposal efforts in the western side of the city. There is also a severe shortage of classrooms.Israeli police officers stand outside of Jerusalem’s Old City during Friday prayers at the al-Aqsa compound recently. (Derek Stoffel/CBC)Living under Israeli occupation, many Palestinians in East Jerusalem, young men especially, must always be ready to show their ID cards to Israeli police who patrol the streets.The Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem reported that Israel demolished at least 73 homes in 2016, after asserting that the owners did not have proper building permits. The group estimates that 295 were made homeless last year.“These are deliberate policies on the part of the Israelis to keep this community marginalized,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former adviser to the negotiating team of the Palestine Liberation Organization.Abbas criticized“And coupled with that, you have the Palestinian political leadership that has been all too ready to give up on Jerusalem and has really done nothing to help people in Jerusalem,” Buttu told CBC News.Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was away on a visit to China when the tensions over security at al-Aqsa began, and some residents of East Jerusalem accused him of underestimating the al-Aqsa protests.Two Palestinian men wear T-shirts bearing the image of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ‘Scram, you collaborator,’ it reads in Arabic. (Facebook)Abbas severed security co-ordination with the Israeli authorities in the West Bank at the height of the crisis at the religious site, but Palestinian media report that the co-operation will be gradually restored.The Palestinian Authority is also reported to have offered East Jerusalem residents $25 million, some of which would be used to compensate business operators who suffered as a result of the demonstrations.‘We don’t want their money’But Khaled Shweiki, who owns a grocery shop in the Old City and recently participated in prayers outside of al-Aqsa, rejected the offer.“We don’t want want their money,” he told CBC News. “We have made our lives without the Palestinian Authority.”Muslim worshippers have now resumed prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque, and the protests have subsided.Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer, says she expects Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem to continue to press their demands, following what she calls their ‘victory’ over Israel’s security measures at al-Aqsa. (Derek Stoffel/CBC)But Diana Butto says the residents of East Jerusalem are now feeling “victorious” — and emboldened.“They’re also feeling that this is just the first round, and that there might be more along the way,” she said.“This is just Round 1, and there’s much more to come.”",

    "body": "Suarez asks: How come no LP members were charged by Ombudsman in six years?Minority Leader Danilo Suarez on Wednesday questioned the Office of the Ombudsman for allegedly not filing a case against members of the Liberty Party over the past years.During the plenary consideration for the Ombudsman’s P2.5-billion proposed budget for 2018, Suarez quizzed its sponsor, Oriental Mindoro Representative Salvador Leachon, on why the anti-graft office have seemingly turning a blind eye on LP officials who commit crimes.Suarez listed down senators and congressmen who were charged over their alleged involvement in the pork barrel scam, but pointed out that only one of them was from the Liberal Party.“Wala bang kasalanang ginawa for the last six years ang mga Liberal?” Suarez said.Leachon, however, said the Office of the Ombudsman does not consider the party in which a government official is a part of in filing cases.It can be recalled that Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales is an appointee of former President Benigno Aquino III, who is from the Liberal Party.“(The) Ombudsman would not look for any party involved. Under the law regardless of the position power, regardless of the memory you have imprinted on the minds of Filipinos, regardless of family affiliations, anything, when there is violation, corresponding charge, you will be dealt with in accordance with the law,” Leachon said.“Upon finding of probable cause, the case will be disposed and it is upon the Sandiganbayan to issue a warrant of arrest. That is the mandate of procedure,” he added.But Suarez insisted that only one member of the Liberal Party was charged over the past years, all others were “enemies” of the previous administration.“Bakit walang fina-file na kaso yung mga dating nakaupo ng nakaraang anim na taon? Alam namin na ang mga finile… marami pa nga plunder e,” he said.Leachon said Suarez’s comments will be noted and the cases within the office’s jurisdiction would be resolved.Suarez explained that he asked the question to assure Morales will not look at political parties in filing cases.“Maaari bang bigyan lang ako ng assurance ng Ombudsman na bago siya umalis sa kanyang opisina na mabigyan naman ng justice ang aming sinasabi na alisin na natin ang political color, gawin ang dapat gawin na yung mga may sala na may allegation ng criminal act, ay mai-file,” he said.In response, Leachon said, “We are definitely assured that they will dispose the cases without biases, without prejudice or referring to party affiliation. Rest assured that the cases will be resolved the soonest time possible before she retires.”Morales will end her term as Ombudsman in mid-2018 after serving for seven yearssource: GMA NewsCommentscomments",

Leila De Lima, vocal critic of President Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, was once again issued an arrest warrant that alleges she was involved in “the proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison during her term as Justice secretary.”According to Sen. De Lima’s legal counsel, Alexandra Padilla, the arrest warrant was issued on June 21, 2017 by Judge Amelia Fabros-Corpuz of the Muntinlupa RTC. The warrant also includes Jose Adrian Dera a.k.a. Jad De Vera.De Lima’s legal counsel is pushing for the arrest warrant to be dropped, seeing it as the weakest among the 3 drug cases that De Lima currently faces from the Department of Justice (DOJ).Senator De Lima is still currently under the custody of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in their custodial center located within Camp Crame. She was arrested and detained on February 23, 2017, also for drug charges. Judge Juanita Guerrero ordered her arrest.The DOJ accused De Lima and Dera of conspiring to extort money from Peter Co, an inmate in Bilibid. Co claims in an affidavit that Dera blackmailed him by detaining and threatening his niece, Sally. Co claims Dera received 2 out of the 5 million pesos that he extorted from the inmate. Dera also allegedly took 4 of Co’s vehicles and used them during Sen. De Lima’s 2016 campaign. Co adds that Dera received 3 million pesos from Co’s niece, which he used to finance Sen.

The healthy exchange of opposing views is crucial in a democracy,” Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a Liberal Party (LP) member, said.Zero allocations are projected to punish and silence opposition legislators even as it is their constituencies who are deprived of the benefits of infrastructure development,” Albay Representative Edcel Lagman said in a seperate statement.Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Representative Villarin condemned President Rodrigo Duterte for his ‘revenge’ against the opposition who criticized his policies including the war against illegal drugs.He said that President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent moves ‘speak much about the dictatorial tendencies of this administration,’.Caloocan Representative Egay Erice said that he would fight until the ‘last drop’ of his blood to protect the people who will be affected by the budget cut.“I will fight to the last drop of my blood before the courts and on the streets if necessary to protect the 8 million Filipinos who will be benefitting from the projects,” he said in a statement.Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno clarified that the lawmakers will not get zero budgets, however the supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte will given more funds for their projects.“If you’re with us then you get something. If you’re not with us then you don’t get something… Allies will get more. More projects,” Diokno saidPresident Rodrigo Duterte is not yet giving any comments on the slash budget for the opposition members.It’s not the first time that the congress used the ‘zero budget’ against the critics of the government.Several months ago, Commission on Human Rights were nearly given a zero budget by the congress, however it was reversed after receiving criticisms from the public.Commentscomments",

Lourdes San Juan as the officer-in-control. It used to be the old city lobby working of Pasay however in 1976, it was remodeled to wind up plainly a 100-bed healing facility.Loading...As per the site of Practo, the multi-claim to fame healing facility has 18 specialists. A portion of the administrations that are given by Pasay City General Hospital are the accompanying: Pediatric, Pulmonology, Ent Section, Thoraectal, and Infertility.Most of the esteemed doctors in the hospital are Dr. Putera (dentist), Dra. Cabrera (pediatrician), Dr. Pidlaoan (internal medicine), and Dra. Galicia-Sy (dermatologist/internal medicine), among others.However, two of the doctors of Pasay City General Hospital are under fire after a Facebook user named Khim Vedana posted her sentiments about physicians Dr. Tanyag and Dr. Susa. According to her, Dr. Tanyag allegedly killed her son named Blake Sebastian.Loading...She said that the doctor knew she was having difficulty breathing and yet, continued to “enormal” her when her oxygen levels decreased.

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines.Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy.First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here.If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor.In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you.Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can’t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat.Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. “Barya lang po sa umaga!” No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please.Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know.If you don’t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant.The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. “God knows who doesn’t pay,” says one jeepney sign.There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: “Bayad po” (here’s my fare) and “Para po” (this is my stop).If you don’t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney’s roof. It also means “please stop.”There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say “one senior” or “one student” when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare.Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn’t that nice?As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.Advertisements",

    "body": "Dear Manileños and privileged city kids everywhere else,I grew up seeing military checkpoints dotting our route from Cagayan de Oro to Surigao. We learned early on to associate the presence of the military with safety because our local news too often would report of this armed group or that terrorist faction making some sort of mess. Although these skirmishes were often not covered by your national media, we Mindanaoans learned early on that our Northern counterparts didn’t really care about us and our government only gave us perfunctory handouts. We learned to be tough and to survive.But we are also tired of having to deal with these armed groups. We want a real end to this. That’s why we voted for the President.So if we have to sacrifice a little of our personal freedom, if we have to adhere to a curfew, if we have to cooperate with the military, WE ARE PREPARED. We’ve done this a million times before.You think your complaints are saving us? They’re not. You only want to feel validated for supposedly “caring” but I bet that before all of this, you knew next to nothing about Mindanao and its people.Kaya don’t us. We’re tired and your complaints are pissing us off.No love,Maia (GenSan-born, raised in Cagayan de Oro; daughter of Mindanao)PS: I still have family and friends in Mindanao. Despite the threat, they know exactly what to do at this point. Unlike you whiners, they’re as tough as reinforced steel. No complaints and fear-mongering from them, just the same old refusal to be intimidated by terrorists.Last week, President Rodrigo Duterte decided to declare Martial Law in Mindanao after the terrorist group Maute attacked Marawi City.As of writing, 61 terrorist already declared killed and the AFP is still continuing their operation against the group.",

    "body": "Recently, Julia Barretto and her siblings decided to bond with their father Dennis Padilla at a Japanese restaurant located in Tomas Morato, Quezon City.Based on Philippine Entertainment Portal’s report, Dennis had an early Christmas dinner with his ex-wife Marjorie Barretto, his current partner Linda Gorton, and his children. Julia and Leon were in the picture but Claudia was not in attendance.Dennis simply captioned the picture with “xmas dinner with the kids.”Also in attendance was Gavin, who is his eldest with Linda. The source cited that in June 2017, Julia Barretto also had dinner with Dennis to celebrate Father’s Day.The patriarch also confirmed that Joshua Garcia was included in the celebration, who is his daughter’s rumored boyfriend. According to ABS-CBN Push, Dennis believed that Julia really wanted him to meet the young man.He said in the interview:“Nung Father’s Day kasi, sabi ni Julia, magdi-dinner daw kami. Tapos, nung pagdating niya, nakita ko nga, may kasama siya, yun nga, si Joshua, and without explaining, ibig sabihin, gusto niyang ipakilala sa akin.”He added that he did a background check on Joshua. Dennis shared:“Nung tinanong ko kay Joshua, sabi ko, ‘Okay ka, bago pa kita makilala, bini-I (BI or background investigation) na kita.’ Yes, inalam ko ang pamilya niya, mabait na bata and I’m sure na magiging mabait siya na maging partner ni Julia.” “Sabi ko lang kay Joshua, ‘Ang mahalaga lang naman, mamahalin mo ‘yung anak ko, wag mo lang sasaktan, wag mo lang lolokohin. Ako naman, komedyante naman ako, pero pagka sinaktan mo ‘yan, niloko mo ‘yan, magiging action star ako.”Meanwhile, his pictures on Instagram indicate that he’s in good terms with Julia Barretto, despite all the controversies they have been facing. If the actress already introduced Joshua to him, then it might be safe to say that she really wanted to be close to him as much as possible.What do you think about Julia Barretto having an early Christmas dinner with her dad? Are you also that close to your father? Share your thoughts and stories in the comments section below!",

    "body": "It’s not easy to be an ice cream vendor, particularly given our country’s hot climate. Aside from the obvious difficulties of hawking your wares in the street, you also have to consider that your product can easily perish under the heat.However, one Facebook user named Abbey Ann Hernandez shared unbelievable pictures of an old man selling ice cream in the middle of an ocean.At first, she revealed that he was merely swimming but apparently, he was carrying a styrofoam container. According to her, it was filled with ice cream products.As of this writing, her post has received a whopping 11,000 likes and reactions, 12,326 shares, and around 2,600 comments from the netizens.Most of them tagged “#KMJS,” which is the official hashtag of the lifestyle magazine program “Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho.” They probably wanted the ice cream vendor to be featured in the mentioned show.The program usually features various stories and lives of interesting people who have gained popularity, even through the internet.However, as of press time, there have been no current episodes about the particular ice cream vendor, hence the netizens’ tag on the program.The uploader, Hernandez, bought a popsicle stick from the vendor and took a picture of it as evidence. Hernandez, along with her family, seemed to be on a makeshift boat that enabled them to float on the sea.It’s not known if the old man was actually selling his frozen goods in the ocean or if he was merely passing by. It might be possible that he was just swimming to reach the other side and happened to pass by the netizen and her family.Meanwhile, here are the netizens’ comments about it:What do you think about this certain ice cream vendor? Are you in awe of him? Let us know your opinions about him in the comments section below!",

    "body": "MANILA, Philippines — There is no escaping the towering Christ the Redeemer with both arms outstretched as it rests on a gigantic ridge.No, it’s not the iconic Cristo Redentor of Rio de Janeiro, but the Christ the Redeemer statue perched on a soaring seacliff at Mount Tao Phùng in the city of Vung Tau.Though partially blocked from public view by surrounding lush vegetation, it stands at 32 meters tall, even higher than Rio’s 30-meter icon.The impressive concrete figure – which welcomes all visitors, for lack of a better term, with its outstretched arms – gazes across the East Sea’s crowning peninsula, situated some 90 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.As construction is on-going, a temporary pathway of a bit over a thousand stone steps may be trod for a little less than an hour to reach a large platform.The wide base is a gilded interpretation of Leonardo Da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” and nearby stands a replica of “The Pieta” by Michelangelo.Lifestyle Feature – Travel ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1According to our knowledgeable and amiable tour guide Trinh Hoang Hanh Nguyen, or Wen as we called him, the surprisingly hollow interior hosts a shop with religious items. A spiral staircase with some hundred levels leads to the statue’s neck.“This connects to the arms, which are balconies that can accommodate up to six persons at a time to enjoy the breathtaking view of the mountains, the city and ultimately the sea,” he continues.Historically, this has been a significant busy port with a continuous stream of oil tankers. The constant shipping activities have likewise influenced its name Vung Tau, which translates to “anchorage.”Today, the city still plays a role in Vietnam’s offshore oil industry – often considered as the crude oil extraction center of the country – and, in fact, dominates the locale’s economy.In recent years, it has successfully transformed into a trendy weekend escape mainly for its convenient proximity from Ho Chi Minh City, frequented by locals and foreigners primarily for the bright sun, the clear sea and the fine sand.We headed to the Vung Tau Lighthouse on Small Mount. This porcelain-white watchtower initially burned kerosene in its lamps, projected beacon light as far as 65 kilometers away and is equipped with telescopes to track ships at sea.Four mounted 10-meter-long French colonial cannons of cast iron and steel were utilized as defense from enemy naval attacks in olden times and today stand proudly as sentry.The Emperor Bao Dai’s rather modest Summer Palace sits on a hill in Da Lat City, dubbed as the City of Love, a must, must see for couples on honeymoon. Built in the 1930s, the art deco styled summer getaway right in the middle of a pine forest was designed both as a place of work and relaxation.It was eventually used as the monarch’s residence during the end of the French colonization era as Bao Dai, the 13th and last ruling member of Vietnam’s royal family, was forced into exile.The ground floor reception area for guests is adorned with mementos of hunting – the emperor’s hobby – such as animal horns on the walls, while guns were on display.Several royal memorabilia were likewise preserved in the pocket museum, to include a 1:1 scale bust of Bao Dai, a golden miniature sculpture of his father Khai Dinh and an image of Angkor Wat, a gift from King Sihanouk of Cambodia.For its novelty in true-to-life aristocratic milieu, do not miss the playroom, where you can don costumes of royal garb, while one may sit on a fake throne for photo-ops.Of particular interest was an exhibit of salvaged relics and artifacts from a shipwreck of a destructive typhoon which eventually washed up on the shores of Hon Cau. The collection of porcelain, pottery, stone, earthen and bronze ware, all with never-seen-before patterns and motifs, date back to the reign of Kang Xi of the Qing Dynasty of China of the 17th to 18th Century.The second floor was dedicated to the living quarters of Emperor Bao Dai and his family – obviously identifiable by their very own quirks and preferences. The son’s room was washed in luxury yellow, the Queen’s space was more feminine highlighted by the presence of several mirrors and lace beddings, while the king’s quarters boasted of a balcony where he could gaze out onto the starry night sky.A short walk to the nearby overgrown garden revealed a hidden bomb shelter, possibly constructed for security of its valued and revered residents.Our midday meal was at Ganh Hao, a popular suggestion from more-than-happy customers on previous trips. An open-air restaurant by the sea with several aquariums of fresh fish and other seafood, it was a rustic, dampa-type establishment filled with discerning locals who all looked like returning regulars.On the terrace, we savored a degustation of what they had to offer: lobsters, prawns, crabs, mantis shrimps, fish to name a few, with some options for preparation – but ultimately, cooked the way we desired.Our itinerary brought us to the Duc Me Bai Dau, a hidden sanctuary far and away from the tourist spots. Immediately of note was the huge statue of the Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus, overlooking a sprawling Catholic complex which boasted of well-constructed walkways amidst blooms and blossoms, dotted by other statues such as one of Saint Peter.The new cathedral by a hill, built on the site of an old place of worship, regularly attracts pilgrims. My personal favorite spot was the centuries old and utterly quaint Sacred Sacrament Chapel – now relocated to its present quiet, cool location – still visited by a devoted, talk-to-no-one lady, who for many years pays daily homage at the adoration.Our final stop was less of an immersion, and more of a lesson, as Wen pointed out Hon Ba, a curious little island which can only be accessed by boat during high tide, or on foot during the low tide. But our timing was off. We were reminded of the at-times isolated Mont Saint Michél in Northern France, which when the seas subside reveals a highway accessible by cars.We soon learned the charming island is home to a mysterious Mieu Ba Temple with several images of deities, faithfully venerated by sailors and fishermen alike.On our return to Ho Chi Minh City, we contemplated a revisit, just so we could visit Hon Ba – either by boat or by foot.",

    "body": "Kevin Spacey. (Photo by JORDAN STRAUSS / Invision/AP)LOS ANGELES (AP) — Director Ridley Scott says he hasn’t heard from Kevin Spacey since the decision was made to cut the actor from “All the Money in the World.”“I don’t know where he is,” Scott said in a recent interview. “He’s gone down underground.”“All the Money in the World” is about the kidnapping of the teenage grandson of wealthy American industrialist J. Paul Getty.The film was completed in October, with Spacey cast as Getty. After sexual misconduct allegations were made against the actor, Spacey was cut from the movie. Christopher Plummer stepped into the role. Reshoots began almost immediately.While promoting the movie over the weekend, Scott said “it would have been nice to have some kind of call, even if it was from his (Spacey’s) representative.”Now, he said, “It’s just too late.”Plummer agreed—”I was very anxious to work with Ridley anyway,” he said. “I took the script home. The next morning, I called, said, ‘Yes. Absolutely. Let’s go.’”To get the movie ready for its Dec. 25 release date, Scott had to raise additional funds and rearrange cast and crew members for reshoots.After that, Scott recalls spending the next 36 hours on the phone figuring out the logistics needed to get the reshoots done. Scott said Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg, the other stars of the film, responded quickly.“They were all ready. Michelle said, ‘I’ll do it.’ She might have been in the middle of a film,’” Scott said. “Mark was needed for a day and a half.”The entire reshoot took nine days.“Obviously, the most important thing was respecting the victims in this case. You know, whether there are allegations or not—there were many—and it’s important to make sure that was dealt with with the respect and sensitivity that it deserved.“Many people have been replaced in films many times, including films that I’ve been involved with on both sides of the spectrum. So those kind of things happen, but it was a decision that Ridley made and we all certainly supported him in that decision,” said Wahlberg, who also attended the film’s premiere.Part of the rush to finish the film was self-imposed: Danny Boyle’s FX series “Trust,” also about the Getty kidnapping, debuts next month, so Scott felt the original release date had to be met.Plummer credits Scott’s sense of humor with getting everyone through the mad dash.“He has a delicious sense of humor and that’s what kept me—gave me such confidence and calmed everything down on the set. It was wonderful,” Plummer said.Plummer also showed he could poke fun at the situation. During the promotional interviews for the movie, he brought a cake that depicted him playing all the roles behind the camera.Plummer’s version of Getty will be the only one anyone ever sees. At the film’s premiere Monday night, Ridley told The Associated Press that he wouldn’t release a director’s cut with Spacey’s work.“Over my dead body. No,” Scott said. “I don’t think that would be very graceful. There’s a great word called grace, right? So I wouldn’t do that, no.” NVGRELATED STORIES:Ridley replaces Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer and delivers a winnerKevin Spacey written off from upcoming movie ‘All the Money in the World’",

    "body": "The grade 11 student Kian Loyd delos Santos who was killed during a drug raid at Caloocan City was recently found out to be the drug courier for his father and uncles, police reports claim.\"Si Kian ay ginagamit ng kanyang ama. Ang ama niya mismo ang user, mga uncle ang mga pusher diyan at ginagamit si Kian na courier. Kaya nag-surface ang pangalan niya sa area mismo,\" Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Ronald dela Rosa said.Dela Rosa disclosed that information from intelligence community and the Caloocan City police claims that Saldy delos Santos, Kian’s father, was notorious for being the neighborhood ruffian which kept witnesses and residents from speaking up about the family.\"Pati ang intelligence community natin na nagko-conduct ng operation plan sa Caloocan mismo, ang mga kapitbahay doon takot mismo na magsalita ng against sa kanila dahil kilalang siga ang ama pati mga uncle niyan, siga sa lugar. Yan ang nasasagap ng ating mga intel operatives diyan sa area,\" dela Rosa said.Kian is viewed as the victim of his family’s illegal drug trade involvement, and dela Rosa acknowledges that there would have been room for change for the young man.\"Biktima lang ang bata at ginagamit ng ama. Bigyan siya ng pagkakataon na magbagong-buhay at matuto na mali ang ginagawa niya. Sumusunod siya sa utos ng kanyang pusher na ama. Bata pa, magbago pa yan,\" he said.The untoward circumstances that happened to Kian is currently being investigated. Dela Rosa has already issued an order to the PNP-Internal Affairs Service (PNP-IAS) lest the “isolated case” affects the whole reputation of the police force.\"I want to reiterate I do not tolerate abuses from my personnel, from my men. So much so that our internal cleansing program having breakthrough, na masisira naman dito kung talagang ma-establish na may pang-aabusong ginawa ang pulis Caloocan,\" he said.In the wake of these controversies, the PNP Chief ordered the relief of Caloocan City Police Chief Senior Superintendent Chito Bersaluna and three other police personnel present during the botched drug raid.While the death of Kian merited the PNP Chief’s dismay, he admits that the drug operation was legitimate due to the drug syndicates involved.\"Dismayed ako sa outcome ng operation, bakit napatay ang bata, pero hindi ako dismayed sa operation itself dahil meron naman talagang basehan ang operation na itinuturo talaga si Kian ay source ng droga doon sa area,\" he said.",

Miguel Zubiri, Dick Gordon, Manny Pacquiao, Risa Hontiveros – all of whom have been ranking high in the surverys, were also backed by the INC.Some of the unexpected additions were Joel Villanueva, Francis Tolentino, Sherwin Gatchalian, Martin Romualdez – as these candidates are circling the 10th to 16th positions in the recent survey.The sample ballots are currently being distributed to members of the church, while the announcement was made in the Wednesday church worship in the Visayas region, May 4.The said endorsement of Duterte was finally decided due to his popularity and lead in the surveys. According to reports, his decision was already made up prior to PNoy’s visit last Monday to make political appeal.For senatorial candidates, the influential religious group throws its support behind the following:former TESDA chief Joel Villanueva,former senator Dick Gordon,Senate President Franklin Drilon,former Akbayan Rep.

    "body": "One of the most common forms of bullying is fat-shaming or mocking a person’s size and weight. Fat-shaming comes from the societal pressure forced especially upon young women to have the ideal “thin” body type. Fat-shaming is bad not only because it is a form of bullying, but also because it pushes people of all body types to conform to a single ideal look.However, some cases of fat-shaming have interesting twists. Looking back in 2011, Breanna Bond hit an overweight index as she weighed a hefty 185 pounds. This put a strain on her breathing, even more so her daily physical activities such as walking.To make it worse, the youngster was bullied due to her huge size. In the talk show “Good Morning America“, Breanna recalled how she was targetted by bullies for her body.“Everybody at school would call me names. They would call me fatty, they would call me fat head.”The constant pushing around drove the girl to experience emotional distress. Having witnessed the suffering of her daughter, Breanna’s mom decided to step in and help her shed weight.Determined to change the life of her daughter, the mom drew up a what she called “zero-tolerance” weight-loss program. Breanna was set to limit her fat intake in food to no more than 20 grams. She was also trained to do intense cardio such as running, swimming, and daily walking.“There was nothing that stopped us. We went at night, in the rain, in the hail, in the fog, nothing. We had a zero-tolerance policy. We’re doing the walk, no matter what.”Thanks to the combined effort of the mom and the daughter, Breanna shocked the world after a fitter version of her was unveiled at the show.“The best thing is that now I can play with my friends and keep up. I can just move more.”While it’s a sad fact that children as young as Brenna are being pressured to conform to societal beauty standards, the 9-year-old girl deserves a pat on the back for her amazing improvement.What can you say about this shocking transformation by the Breanna Bond? How about on the societal pressure affecting youngsters such as the 9-year-old girl? Let us know what you think and feel about this story by leaving your comment in the section below!",

However, some appear to stay anonymous, not to evade the limelight, but to evade accountability.A few days ago, SilentNoMore PH called majority bloc senators “Malacanang Dogs” for not signing the Senate Resolution calling for an investigation on alleged extrajudicial killings in the country [ TV5 ].The senators named by SilentNoMorePH are:Referring to these seven senators, SilentNoMore PH said:“Their loyalty is to the palace, not to Filipino people whose votes gave them mandate to begin with… These senators’ votes are reflective of their stance: They don’t care about lives. They don’t want to hold this government accountable. They only care about their alliance with Malacanang… These are the senators who will block any action that would investigate the sins of the government. These are the senators whose silence lead(s) to continuous murder of poor and innocent children”Silent No More PHDomain PrivacyGoogle AdSenseSo let’s ask: who’s earning money from SNM’s website?SilentNoMorePHOpen Google Chrome.

DOES BAM AQUINO HAVE A HAND IN ALL THESE?Cocoy controls even more anonymous sitesChangeScammingBackroom PoliticsPinoy Ako BlogLeveling-up the ResearchFirst and just for kicks,SecondThird and most interestinglyWhat to do with Cocoy DayaoDONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:The problem? These seven senators were not even notified that there was such a senate resolution to begin with. That is, they cannot possibly say no to a question that was never asked to them in the first place.All seven senators are visibly incensed over SilentNoMore PH’s irresponsible post, with Senator Sotto even planning to file cyber libel cases against those behind the social media entity.But there’s a problem: Who are behind Silent No More PH?And that’s what I’ll try to answer, and more.In April 2016, I published “ #BangkoSerye: Sonny Trillanes and his Hacker-Friend ”, where I successfully uncovered self-proclaimed hacker and Magdalo member Bem Pontejos as the administrator behind EllenTordesillas.com I did that using a simple WhoIs lookup, which basically shows the contact information of a website’s registrant, administrator, and tech contacts.WhoIs lookups, however, do not always work because of domain privacy services, or paid services that allow website owners to hide their identity by using third-party contact information in lieu of their own. In the BangkoSerye issue, Bem Pontejos immediately subscribed to domain privacy services from WHOISGUARD to hide his details, even if it was already late.Unfortunately, SilentNoMore PH also has domain privacy protection, with its registrant, admin, and tech contacts showing as “Contact Privacy Inc.”, which is obviously a domain privacy services provider.Hence, WhoIs won’t be very useful in unmasking SilentNoMore PH (SNM PH).But wait, there’s more!Serving Google Adsense advertisements, such as the one seen below, is the most popular way to earn money from a website. SNM PH’s website silentnomore.ph has such advertisements.The funny thing about Google Ads is that Google requires site administrators to verify their identity and physical addresses before they are even allowed to insert ads in their websites.Google verifies addresses by sending snail mail containing a passcode to administrators. Upon receiving the letter, the administrators use these passcodes to activate their respective accounts. This makes the process very tedious for residents of countries like the Philippines since the letters are usually mailed from the United States. For example, it took me three months before I received my Google Adsense letter, and only then was I able to serve ads on .net Thus, it’s not impossible for ads served on SNM’s website to originate from a Adsense account that’s also used by other websites.Now, Google Adsense source codes, when inserted into a web page, show the ad’s Google AdSense Publisher ID. The Google Adsense Publisher ID is a unique numeric identifier for a Google AdSense Account. Thus, knowing who’s behind SNM is just a matter of getting the Publisher ID in SNM’s ads and comparing it to the publisher IDs of sites whose owners are already known.Why? Because it’s the owner of the AdSense Account who financially benefits from all the Google ads served using that account, regardless of what website those ads are served. Surely, no moron will allow others to steal earnings from his own website.If I were a website owner, why would I let my site’s ad earnings go to somebody else?SNM PH’s desktop version has an advertisement field at the top of the home page and we can get the Google Adsense Publisher ID through the following steps:After performing these steps, you will see something similar to the following image:The number immediately succeeding “ca-pub”, which is “pub-8283971809912134”, is the Google AdSense publisher ID of whoever owns or controls SilentNoMorePH.At this point, the question would be “So what other sites serve ads with the same publisher ID?”With the publisher ID already known, it’s now just a matter of finding other websites whose administrators are already known and whose Google Ads feature the same publisher ID.Using the same process of finding publisher IDs, we found out that the ads served on ProPinoy.net also feature the same publisher ID “pub-8283971809912134”, as shown below.But it doesn’t end there. Madam Claudia’s site ads also use the the publisher ID “pub-8283971809912134”, as shown below.In short, Cocoy Dayao, the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of ProPinoy.net , also owns or controls the websites of SilentNoMore PH and Madam Claudia, websites whose content are shared in their respective Facebook Pages.There are also three other sites that share the same publisher ID “pub-8283971809912134”, as shown below:These sites are:1: WeSupportBamAquino.com - pro-Bam website that attacks critics of Bam Aquino.2: ThinkingMillenialsPH.com - a site that focuses on attacking pro-Duterte bloggers, all are anti-Duterte posts.3: PulisPatola.com - a fake news site that focuses on attacks against the credibility of the police force.We’re already here anyway, so we might as well check other anonymous websites and see if they’re also owned or controlled by Cocoy Dayao.I also checked the publisher ID used in the ads served in the following sites:As it turns out, all three sites use the Google Adsense Publisher ID “pub-1068157602481996”. Below is a screen recording showing how I extracted the publisher IDs of all six sites:Now, Sass Rogando Sasot has earlier shown that Cocoy Dayao is the administrator contact of Pinoy Ako Blog (PAB), which PAB later acknowledged in a blog post [ PAB ], though PAB claims that Dayao is just a webmaster (administrator) and not the actual content creator behind PAB.Regardless, what’s clear here is that Cocoy Dayao is the administrator not only of PAB, but also of Backroom Politics and ChangeScamming. If Dayao sees nothing wrong in being a potential accessory to a crime, then that’s his problem, not ours.But wait... there’s more, a lot more!It appears that Cocoy Dayao owns or controls six sites so far, but a more comprehensive search shows that Dayao owns or controls many other fake news sites.Using a paid TCPIPUtils.com subscription, I checked for sites using the two Google Adsense Publisher IDs linked to Dayao. TCPIPUtils is a “freemium service”, or a service that can be used for free, but whose features are limited unless a user has a paid subscription.I did a reverse Adsense lookup on my own Google Adsense Publisher ID “pub-2492942939032867” and it shows only two sites:.com and .net , domains that I actually own, as shown below:, I did the same on the ID “pub-8283971809912134”, as shown below:Aside from ProPinoy, Madam Claudia, and Silent No More, three other websites with one being twentyeightfourteen.com , where the [ about page ] is a writeup about Cocoy Dayao, suggesting that Dayao owns or controls this site., I did a reverse Adsense lookup on “pub-1068157602481996”, as shown below:Aside from PinoyAkoBlog, ChangeScamming, and BackroomPolitics, Dayao also owns or controls the other smaller news or opinion sites such as:Yeah, that’s a lot, and I am only talking about those websites that I was able to find.How many more does Cocoy Dayao own or control?Dayao, in his LinkedIn and [ UpWork ] profiles, calls himself the “Chief Technical Officer” of a certain “Lab Rats Technica Digital Consulting”, a Lipa-based single-proprietorship IT services firm and at this point, it is clear that Cocoy Dayao is involved in these sites in a significant capacity.We still have to verify if he himself creates some or all of the content for these sites, or if he has associates who help him with it. However, I am inclined to believe the latter because the sheer number of these websites and their varying tones of writing suggest an organization behind the effort as opposed to just one martyr.Does Dayao do this for love of country, or does he have other motivations? According to his linkedin account, he was a PCOO consultant from 2012 until PNoy stepped down in June 2016. Besides, he does web programming and development for a living.Dayao is not that smart, as evidenced by his monumental carelessness that led to the creation of this article. Thus, it’s not unlikely that there’s someone behind him who’s calling the shots, who’s providing the funds.Being the administrator of several fake news sites, Dayao should be invited to the October 4th Senate Hearing on Fake News so the Senate can find out who the brains and the money behind this Liberal Party Propaganda Machine.Who knows, this might actually be the well-oiled, well-funded propaganda machinery that Maria Ressa has been talking about?Has Ressa been barking up the wrong tree the entire time?At the rate things are going, apparently so.

Aside from the significant expenses, such as placement fees and miscellaneous costs, an OFW has to risk facing possible maltreatment from abusive employers. It is a story often heard of, especially from those working in the Middle East.Recently, a Facebook post of a certain Neleh Asan Elegino went viral after sharing the heartbreaking story of her sister-in-law, Maria Jingge Antipuesto Elejeno, who is currently recuperating in a hospital in Saudi Arabia.According to Neleh, Maria was reportedly pushed out of a window by her employer, causing her to fall and sustain severe injuries. She supposedly underwent operation for the bodily damage resulting from the second floor drop.As of writing, the post already amassed 7,100 reactions and has been shared 34,606 times, in the hopes that a government agency will take notice of their pitiful plight. Likewise, the website Kwentong OFW also picked up the distressing story.Based on Neleh’s account, Maria suffered much from her abusive employer. Her post partly read:“Minaltrato po siya ng kanyang amo hinulog po siya s second floor sa bintana. Nabali po yong paa at spinal cord. At naoperahan na po siya.”In a series of photos, Maria looked like she was in pain. She was lying on the hospital bed with her left leg and right foot in a cast. According to Neleh, the woman is admitted at the King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh.In the short video clip included in Neleh’s post, Maria, in a small voice and near tears, was recounting the horrors she experienced from her boss, such as not getting paid on time and physical harm.Through the social media post, Maria and her family are seeking help from the Philippine government and channels for her immediate repatriation.Read the whole Facebook post here:Here are some of the netizens’ reaction on this matter:Watch her heartbreaking appeal here:Posted by Neleh Asna Elegino on Tuesday, December 12, 2017Do you know the OFW seeking for help?

Si De Lima rin ang itinuturo ng Department of Justice (DOJ) na nasa likod ng pagkalat ng ilegal na droga sa Bilibid.Inakusahan din ng Pangulo at ng DOJ si De Lima na may sex video kasama si Dayan. Umabot pa sa puntong ipalalabas dapat ito sa pagdinig ng Kamara ngunit hindi ito natuloy dahil wala umanong kopyang hawak si DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II.\"He has accused her of 'screwing her driver,' 'pumping,' and playing with a man's genitals. He has likened her to an 'x-rated artist' and claimed that she has a 'propensity for sex,'\" wika ng kampo ni De Lima.\"He has threatened her that he 'will destroy her in public,' that she 'is finished' and has vowed that she 'will rot in jail,\" dagdag niya.Matapos ang imbestigasyon sa Kamara at pagharap ng mga high-profile inmates sa pagdinig ay hindi rin sinampahan ng kaso ng si De Lima.Hiniling naman ni De Lima na pigilan ng mataas na hukuman ang gobyerno sa paggamit ng kaniyang mga personal information upang siraan siya.",

His challenge was never taken on by his colleagues.According to Canda, his intentions with a public debate was to raise public awareness of the current state of Brgy. Marulas' budget which its council apparently failed to approve since 2014.Canda's challenge to a public debate did not come into fruition but Viray, one of his co-barangay councilmen took to social media and posted his thought about it.Here's Viray's Facebook post dated August 16, 2017 at 4:23 p.m.:\"Kakabalik ko lang ng coop ng salubungin ako ng napakaraming PM, aysus... bottomline may naghahamon sa amin (hindi lang sa akin) ng debate...Hindi sana kita papatulan kaso yung isang post mo, nandun yung name ko kaya sasagutin kita kahit minsan 'TOL...Una, pasensya na kayong nagsasabing kasahan ko at wala namang panama sa kin yan... tama po kayo... kaya bat ko papatulan... sayang lang oras ko... di pag pinatulan ko dagdag yun sa pagpapalipas oras nya kasi wala namang ginagawa yan bukod sa shooting nya bilang extra sa home sweetie home na malapit na yatang matsugi sa ABS CBN..Mga kasama, kung lagi pong pambungad ng aking kaibigan na isa po syang artista, ako po wag na nating sabihing MD o MELO po ako... dun na lang po kami magharap sa PAREHAS PO KAMING KAGAWAD... may proper venue tayo ng pagtatalunan... ng pagde DEBATIHAN... hindi sa PLAZA...

Viray said he was asleep at the time his opponent issued the challenge and found out about it a little bit later.So as not to look like he backed out of an expressed challenge to a fist fight by his fellow people elected public official, he set his own schedule for their brawl and chose SM Valenzuela appliance center, ground floor.As was expected ofthat was scheduled in two different times and venues, Canda and Viray's social media war and talk of 'suntukan' did not come into blows.Here are some photos from Kagawad Ivan Viray proving that he came to the supposed battlefield:Meanwhile, Canda posted this message on his Facebook account:While we would so much like to see two elected officials beat the crap out of each other and see them tear each other's flesh with their teeth like crocodiles (buwaya in Tagalog), the people of Marulas no doubt prefer to know the truth of the issue instead.What the eff happened to the budget? Who's playing who? Where did the people's taxes go? The people's taxes. And most importantly, when and where will Danny Canda and Ivan Viray's fistfight match be rescheduled and held?",

And then super dark. E ‘di ba ‘pag rock and roll, head bang? Hindi ko nakita na may mic pala in front of me. And ‘pag nag-head bang kasi ako, pak, ganun. Nung tumama ako, nag-blackout na ako, e,\" she told PEP.She also said, “I’m still singing ‘tapos duguan na raw ako. So they had to carry me out of stage to the hospital. They had to rush me to the hospital. Nagising ako tinatahi na yung mata ko. Sabi ko, ‘Anong ginagawa niyo? Is it bad?’ Hindi sila sumasagot, yung mga friends ko. ‘No, no.’\"“Mahirap kasi talagang grabe, para akong binugbog ni Pacquiao, yung first few days. So tinahi yung eyelid ko, talagang wide open. They don’t have to stitch the nose naman, pero talagang malala, so dinikit nila iyan. Yun ang worry ng mga doktor, na parang, ‘You really need a very good cosmetic surgeon,\" she added.Meanwhile, some netizens said they could not even recognize her now and cast doubts of the photos' authenticity.I'm pretty sure this one's edited.What do you think? Do you think Arci Muñoz had plastic surgery nose lift and horribly failed?",

On the other hand, the Church leaders have shown support for the anti-drug campaign but stated they are against the killings associated with it.President Duterte also asked Church leaders to talk to village chiefs. Village chairs, he said, were not in the frontline of this war on drugs because “40 percent of them are involved in drugs. You see? That’s how serious the problem is.”“We are now a narcostate. You ask why I did not tap the barangay captains (village chiefs)? I cannot trust the idiots anymore,” the President said.He stated he had to tap the military’s help in destroying drug factories and running after all drug suspects. He’s no longer trust the village chiefs because of the involvement of many village officials in drugs. But he emphasized that his order did not include killing the suspects.“You can ask the military or the police in Manila if I ordered them to (kill drug suspects). If anyone of them stands up and say I ordered them to kill the poor and the children, I would resign because that would make me a liar.”“That’s the truth,” he added.He said the Church would always find fault in his antidrug campaign because of what he said were irreconcilable positions on how to deal with the drug menace.“For them, it’s pity and not hatred,” the President said. “No response. But the law is not like that. It takes pity on you but at the same time punishes you by jailing you,” he said.He also said the war on drugs did not target the poor.“I am here to enforce the law,” the President saidsource inquirerIn the Philippines, the Church holds a strong power over the nation that their opinions and beliefs matter. They have been part in ruling the country. When Rodrigo Duterte became the President, the Church seemed to be on the opposite side. They questioned the President’s capacity especially now that the war on drugs is a top issue.The President is now challenging the Church to help him on his war on drugs by taking the “preemptive move” of convincing drug suspects to reform.During a dinner with reporters, President Duterte said he would provide the list of drug suspects to the priest and they, together with the Church Leaders could reach out to those who were on his list of drug suspects and talk them out of the drug trade.",

According to her, the photographer touched her private parts and 'ate' her.She said that he forced himself on to her inside a motel room where the supposed photo shoot took place. The photographer also allegedly took pictures of her in a compromising position as he was taking advantage of her.She also said she was reluctant to come forward and report the incident at first because Hilario blackmailed her, threatening to spread her photos if she tells anyone of what he did to her.Maris eventually decided to come forward and asked Raffy Tulfo In Action for help. Tulfo made contact with the photographer in question and allowed him to air his side. During their phone conversation, Hilario admitted doing the things he was being accused of.This prompted Tulfo and the victim to proceed to file a case at Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. According to Tulfo, several other women who were also models and past subjects for photo shoots with Hilario, also came forward adding their own complaint against him.One other victim claims that she was penetrated by Hilario against her will during a photo shoot with him.Raffy Tulfo In Action obtained a screenshot from of Hilario's chat conversation where he admits 'eating' the complainant for 10 minutes:He also claims that there is no proof that he forced himself on the model and that she wanted it too:Apparently, Hyson Hilario uses his profession in photography as a way to get women. He would promise aspiring models that they will get exposure on social media and be added to his portfolio. He would then make advances on the models during the photoshoot often held in motel rooms. Because of this, the internet now dubs him as \"TuhogGrapher\". A play on words photographer and tuhog, a Tagalog word for 'pierce'.",

So nakakabawas pa sa mga possible abuses na mako-commit (People’s consciousness and awareness that there’s martial law will allow them to pay attention to our security forces. It could even reduce the possible abuses committed),” he said.Lacson said that the reason why majority of lawmakers voted for the extension was because they saw that it was nothing like the martial law imposed during the term of former President Ferdinand Marcos.“Kaya nga siguro yan din ang tinitingnan ng mga bumoto na wala naman peligro na maabuso ito (Perhaps the reason those who voted for the extension saw that it was no longer prone to abuse),” he added.He also said that he expected that the one-year martial law extension would provide a “psychological boost” which would allow them to better combat terrorist forces.",

But did you know that a real Italian family possesses a superhuman quality that most of us would have wished for? Yes, this wonder family has a rare genetic condition that causes them to have an “extremely low sensitivity to pain.”This means that this family can experience broken bones and drink scalding hot beverages and not even flinch due to the pain. The Marsilis could even down a whole pepper and still be unaffected, all because of the ZFHX2 gene.Dr. James Cox of the University College London is one of the lead authors of the study analyzing the Marsili family and their rare quality. Dr. Cox gave us a summary of what is really going on inside the bodies of this wonder family.“The members of this family can burn themselves or experience pain-free bone fractures without feeling any pain. But they have a normal intraepidermal nerve fibre density, which means their nerves are all there, they’re just not working how they should be.“Although the team is not sure how the genetic mutation functions, they hypothesized that “the variant disrupts how ZFHX2 regulates other genes that have been linked to pain signaling.” The disruption results in the amazing pain tolerance of the Marsili family.Being known as the only ones to have this genetic condition, the scientists have named it as the “Marsili syndrome.” But it’s not all daisies and butterflies, some family members sustained injuries that have not healed properly because they didn’t even know it happened in the first place.Despite such a dangerous consequence, sensory neurobiologist John Wood asked the Marsilis if they would like to give this “special power” up and all of them said no.“I asked them if they would like to normally sense pain and they said no.“Do you envy the Marsili family for not being able to feel that much physical pain? What do you think are some of the major consequences of this condition? Share your thoughts, reactions, and opinions in the comments section below!",

Amirite? Whatever it is, we can only hope that it will be revealed in the future.When she was asked by the netizen about her “evidence”, she answered with this:One thing’s without a doubt however, individuals are favoring Pia and Sarah on this one. They are stating that they are pleased with the glamorous lady and that they will dependably cherish Pia. They are stating that Alexander ought to simply keep his mouth close in the event that he doesn’t need this to explode to amazing magnitude, something that could most likely happen.In spite of the fact that, there are other individuals who are stating that they should’ve quite recently kept their lives in private so things like this won’t occur in any case. There were even other people who said this is Pia Wurtzbach’s blame for bringing the story up!Loading...However, hold up, there’s additional! There are a few people who are stating that the blame lies with the journalists who they’re blaming for including components in the story!",

    "body": "Metro Manila traffic supposedly costs P2 billion a day in actual and opportunity losses. That’s been going on for ten years now. Meaning, P7.3 trillion has been wasted in the 3,650-day mess. Most of it stems from EDSA, the capital region’s main artery; any gridlock on EDSA, which is everyday, jams the entire metropolis.It’s time the government unclog EDSA. A drastic way is to expand both sides by one five-meter-wide lane each. That would give buses extra lanes. More important, the two old center lanes can be used for bus rapid transport.That would necessitate expensive expropriation and paving. But the total cost won’t be as much as the trillion-peso losses. In fact, it would be a smart investment.Do the numbers. EDSA is nearly 25 km or 25,000 meters long. If expropriation is at P200,000 per square meter for prime EDSA property, it would cost P2 million for every ten-meter width. Multiply that by 25,000 meters, and the entire property buyout would cost P50 billion. Demolition of structures and 10-meter-wide concreting, at P1 billion per km, would cost P25 billion. So the total EDSA widening would cost P75 billion, or about one-percent of the P7.3 trillion lost in a decade.A private company can then operate the bus rapid transport, like a train with no tracks. It would pay the government a yearly franchise fee. Running with the MRT-3 and regular buses, EDSA can then better move people.Of course, only a tough President, partnering with a visionary constructor, would be able to do that. The alternative is unthinkable: daylong traffic standstill. Uber, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the World Bank, and local traffic experts separately forecast that.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1* * *The plan is to extend Gen. Bato dela Rosa’s PNP director generalship by two months, then to make him Prisons Bureau chief. His mission there would be to stop the thriving narco-trade from behind bars. But the question is, haven’t they already done that?The eight prison narco-lords are supposed to be incommunicado. The Justice department had moved them from the National Penitentiary in Muntinlupa to the Intelligence Service-AFP compound in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City. That supposedly was meant not only to “secure” them from assassination in prison while testifying against Sen. Leila de Lima. More important, it was to cut them off from their narco-syndicates outside. Meanwhile the PNP’s Special Action Force was supposed to replace all the prison guards at the Penitentiary’s maximum security zone. They were tasked to conduct frequent surprise raids of prison cells to confiscate drugs and mobile phones. If those did not happen after all, then somebody goofed. Dela Rosa’s first task there should be to find out who, and report to President Rodrigo Duterte.At any rate, dela Rosa would have two months to plan his new drug war at the prisons while winding down from the PNP. “Tok-hang” – knocking on doors cell by cell and pleading with hardened criminals to please stop using and pushing “shabu” – won’t work there. The inmates won’t fight back either – “nanlaban” – with rusty .38-caliber revolvers; firearms supposedly should be confiscated. Drug syndicates behind bars have their own way of fighting back – with huge piles of cash instead of bullets. Those are their ways, as the prison narco-lords purported in Congress. Those allegedly are the evidence against de Lima for narco-trafficking while she was justice secretary.The measure of dela Rosa’s success is whether he is able to stop the flow of drug money from the rich prisoners.* * *Catch Sapol radio show, Saturdays, 8-10 a.m., DWIZ (882-AM).Gotcha archives on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jarius-Bondoc/1376602159218459, or The STAR website http://www.philstar.com/author/Jarius%20Bondoc/GOTCHA",

    "body": "Manila Times writer Rigoberto Tiglao broke down how the Rufino-Prieto family owes almost Php 3 billion to the Filipinos in taxes from their Mile Long prime property in Makati and Dunkin’ Donuts enterprise.“If government’s claims are valid, and its figures accurate, the Rufino/Prietos’ liabilities through their firm Sunvar Realty and Development Corp. would be this P1.8 billion, plus the P1.5 billion alleged tax evasion by another firm they own, Dunkin’ Donuts,” Tiglao explainedWith the amount of almost Php 3 billion, Rufino-Prieto are just like any other Chinese-Filipino tycoons “notorious for being tax evaders”.President Arroyo’s Solicitor General Agnes Devanadera in 2009 revealed that the elite family owed Php 1.8 billion for Sunvar. This was based on the Php 630 million the family owes from illegal and unauthorized use of the property from 2003 to March 21, 2009 and the Php 10.4 million monthly rent from April 2008 until it was given over to the government.Rufino-Prieto dismissed their debts after maneuvering through several court cases and continued to charge rentals from over 400 stores for 14 years after its lease expired in 2002.The Sunvar debt is a “measly rent of P360 per square meter per month government is asking Sunvar to pay—a give-away price in a prime area where rents are at least P50,000 per sq. m. per month.”Supreme Court (SC) issued a decision on 2012 that urged the elite family to pay ASAP the debts that they owe to the State.In the SC’s court ruling, it said:“The Court notes that respondent Sunvar has continued to occupy the subject property since the expiration of its sublease on 31 December 2002. The factual issue of whether respondent has paid rentals to petitioners from the expiration of the sublease to the present was never raised or sufficiently argued before this Court. Nevertheless, it has not escaped the Court’s attention that almost a decade has passed without any resolution of this controversy regarding respondent’s possession of the subject property.”Despite the intervention of the SC, the lower court took three years to issue a decision. Metropolitan Trial Court Judge Barbara Aleli Briones in July 2015 ordered Sunvar to pay only P555 million, a mere 30% of what they owe.It was until the case reached Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 141 Maryann Corpus-Manalac and MRTC Branch 59 Judge Winlove Dumayas that the Rufino-Prieto family had their way and was granted control of the property.Tiglao pointed out that when the Mile Long property was being guarded over by former President Macapagal-Arroyo, their news arm, Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) “demonized” Arroyo and continuously publicized alleged corruption scandals.However, when former President Benigno Aquino III took seat and suspended the case on the questionable lease of their properties, PDI “unabashedly idolized and supported” his administration.President Rodrigo Duterte swore to look into these property deals of the Rufino-Prieto firm as he also lambasts their news arm for criticizing and demonizing his administration when the elite family owes up to billion to the Flipinos.Tiglao challenges the status quo and questioned, “what would the hundreds of thousands of urban poor squatters in the metropolis say when riot police try to eject them? ‘Why us poor, not the rich squatting on prime government land?’”",

Let us and other netizens know your thoughts by commenting below!Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you. As difficult as it may seem, you can always choose to let go, move on, and start over. What little strength you think you may have can bring you wonders and blessings if you only let it. This is exactly the story of a certain Brian Laurence, who was originally from New Zealand. At the age of 61, he runs a small business selling vegetables in Kidapawan that he himself grows. Things, however, were not always so good for the old man. He shared his story with a netizen, Joy Dondan, who posted it on Facebook. The post has since garnered 39,000 reactions and 44,477 shares.In her post, Joy told the story of Brian. Brian first came to the Philippines eight years ago to meet a friend whom he met through social media. After a while, their friendship blossomed into a relationship. However, Brian noticed that his lover wanted something else from him. Little by little, she siphoned his money. She told him that she was investing in a business for them, and that the house they were living in was also bought with his money. Brian found out a little too late that none of this was true. They had no investment in any business, and the house they were staying in was apparently only being leased to them. He was soon evicted for failure to pay rent. Brian also found out that his girlfriend was not really a woman, but rather, a man. By that time, he could no longer locate her. With no friends or relatives here in the Philippines, Brian’s future seemed bleak.However, the New Zealand citizen did not let his misfortunes get the better of him. Instead, he chose to live here and start anew. With the help of some friends that he has made in Kidapawan, Brian Laurence started his own small business of growing crops and selling them. He usually goes door to door to sell them, and always makes friends with his new customers. The netizen who posted his story encouraged everyone to buy vegetables from Brian as they are guaranteed fresh and organic. In a video that accompanied the post, a woman can be seen buying a lot of ginger from Brian.When asked why he did not go to his embassy to ask for help so he could return home, Brian Laurence said that he does not want to leave the Philippines yet.As a final note, the netizen then reminded everyone that no matter how big one’s problems may be, one can always overcome it as long as one chooses to.Read the full post below:Read the full post below:",

Footage of the newly-minted Mrs. Heussaff decorating a Christmas tree has gone viral online.The Christmas tree is perhaps the quintessential symbol of the Yuletide season. There truly is a satisfying and comforting feeling that comes with being able to finish putting up one’s own tree, which is probably the reason why people give a lot of their time and effort in doing so.Not one to be outdone, Anne Curtis made sure that her first Christmas tree as Mrs. Heussaff is something worth remembering.In a video posted by Youtube Channel “Pinas Idols”, a very serious-looking Anne Curtis can be seen unwrapping Christmas ornaments for their Christmas tree.The video was taken by her husband, Erwan Heussaff, who seems to like documenting his wife a lot.In the video, Erwan can be heard saying, “Anne gets really OC (obsessive-compulsive) with her Christmas tree.” He then focuses the camera on Anne’s face, then on the Christmas tree, then back to Anne. The tree looks almost finished, but judging by the number of decors still unopened, it seems as if it’s only halfway done.Anne then looks at Erwann, pretending to be unamused, and says, “Help me nalang.” She can be seen cutting the bubble wraps individually to take out the other ornaments.Anne Curtis and Erwan Heussaff officially tied the knot on November 12 in Queenstown, New Zealand. This is their first Christmas together as Mr. and Mrs. Heussaff.What do you think of Anne Curtis decorating her very first Christmas tree as Mrs. Heussaff? Sound off in the comments section below!",

    "body": "When former Hasht5 member Marlou Arizala – a.k.a. Xander Ford – stated that he would undergo a cosmetic surgery to enhance his look for a “new him,” the public had varied opinions.Some fully supported him while there were others who stated that it was purely an act of vanity meant to boost his career, which they said he would never have.Despite the protestations, Xander Ford soldiered on and went ahead with the surgeries anyway. He underwent an operation that enhanced his facial features and skin tone.Previously, he was bashed for his acne-marked face but now, people are admiring him – so to speak – for his flawless complexion and “movie star” looks.The social media sensation first appeared in public post-surgery in October 2017.According to Philippine Daily Inquirer, “His skin looked lighter and clearer, his nose sharper, and his jawline is now more defined. Gone were his braces as he flashed a set of perfect teeth. His hair was no longer accessorized with a bandana; he now sports a fade haircut.”Xander’s mother admitted that she initially disapproved of the young man’s undergoing the operations since he might experience complications.However, she supported her son and embraced him as he appeared for the first time in public. Mrs. Arizala shared, “Salamat sa Panginoon kasi po ay naging successful ang pagawa sa kanyang ilong.”Now, months after Xander Ford changed his look, a video of him has started to gain attention. It was shared by the YouTube channel “Pinoy Showbiz Latest,” where it has received 68,446 views, 27 likes, and around 25 comments as of this writing.According to the comments section, netizens have begun to notice that his old appearance is starting to show once again.The clip, based on the title, was taken from Xander’s Instagram live updates. Most of them stated that the “medicine” of the cosmetic surgery is now losing its streak.The video featured Xander Ford in sunglasses, where he was being styled and made up by his assistants. Nothing seemed extraordinary, except perhaps the fact that his complexion might not appear as flawless as before.Or is it?Watch the video below:Here are some of the comments from the netizens:What do you think? Do you think the old appearance of Xander Ford is starting to show? Let us know your thoughts and opinions about this in the comments section below!source: phfeed",

I have no quarrel with religion because religion will not save you. It is God who will decide your fate.Since your job is to educate the faithful, my job is to eradicate those who are killing the faithful. How can one think about God, honor his father, mother, brothers, sisters and neighbors if he has been affected by drugs ? An addict only thinks of when to get the next fix and if he cannot afford it, he will steal, he will rob your home and even kill just to satisfy his addiction. That is my job – Cardinal, it is not for me, but for the next generation whom I want to see a truly “drug free society” in our country. Can you solve that problem Cardinal ?CARDINAL : No, I cannot solve the drug problem.PRESIDENT : Look at the squatters behind your comfort zone, go and try to examine the gravity of the drug problem in this nation caused by the previous government – a total neglect of the human being’s potential to grow and prosper. They destroyed our people – Cardinal, and you remained quiet on that. You should examine your conscience and try to fight this evil within.CARDINAL : Perhaps I will.PRESIDENT : You might look at me as a street educated person, a probinsyano, a lowly person who is not educated in Ateneo, but please be reminded that I am elected by more than 16 million Filipinos, while you are just appointed by the Vatican. Let it sink for a moment. Peace be with you Cardinal.",

I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn’t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.

It was built by the Spaniards as a settlement for Catholic Chinese, and was positioned across the Pasig River so that the colonial rulers could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects. To this day, it continues to be a center of commerce and trade in Manila where all types of businesses are run by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry.Almost a quarter of the Philippines’ 100 Million population are of Chinese descent, and China is demanding loyalty from them.The administration of Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino immediately protested the Chinese announcement, saying “China cannot just kidnap 25 percent of our population. What are they planning to do? Build a wall around Binondo and make our Chinatown their overseas seat of government?”Aquino called U.S. President Barack Obama at 3 a.m. Monday morning (U.S. East Coast time) to report the latest move by the Chinese government.The U.S. and the Philippines have a mutual defense agreement which provides for the use of Philippine bases by American military forces. In exchange, the Americans are training the Filipinos on military combat and providing military equipment to help the Philippines defend itself against foreign aggressors.Unfortunately, Obama was out of the country attending a summit meeting of the G7 nations.Advertisements",

Get in my boat and I will save you.”At which time the religious man said,“I have total faith in my God. He will not let me drown.”As the water neared his head, another boat came by.The man stopped and said the same thing.To which the near drowning man stated, “I have total faith in my God. He will not let me drown.”So, the boat went away.A third boat came by. This boater was frantic, being that the water was lapping at the man’s nose.

Why would You let me down like that? You made no effort to stop the tide!”At which time God stated,“Holy Cow, man, what more did you want from Me? I sent you three boats!!!”",

But what if inside a surprise comes another surprise? Isn’t it romantic? One man has done a very unique birthday surprise in Singapore with a romantic twist at the end.A loving boyfriend named Jensen wanted to surprise her girlfriend Evelyn on her birthday so he secretly arranged a vehicle to pick up Evelyn at her workplace on June 30th, 2014.Inside the vehicle was her boyfriend’s 1st surprise- a box with a stuffed toy inside and a sweet note from him.He wrote, “Hi Princess Evelyn, remember me? The Stitch you have always been hugging while in the car? I’m back for you! Your journey has just begun. Sit tight, relax, and have fun!”Evelyn was then brought to a salon. She had no idea that she will be given a complete makeover for free.After the makeover, Evelyn received another box with a note.“Take a look into our love journey. All the countries and memories we had been through. I want to walk on with you again to many countries and to fill our album with more love!”, Jensen wrote.This time, the box was filled with photos from their trips together.But it seems like Jensen’s surprises were endless. The lucky girlfriend was brought to a boutique full of decorations and personal mementos of the couple.Jensen recalled how he met Evelyn again in school. They started dating and after their exams, he took her to Taiwan because she said that she hasn’t been on an overseas trip. He also said that Evelyn has been showing her videos of unique proposals and kept asking when he will do it. Lucky for her, the moment she has been waiting for is finally here.As Evelyn walked towards the middle of the store, she found a note on the seat that reads, “Dearest Princess, Please take a seat. I will be with you shortly.”At this point Evelyn knew what was going on. Jensen’s final surprise was indeed a romantic proposal!Jensen emerged from the dressing room with a bouquet and knelt in front of Evelyn to pop the question.Of course she said ,”Yes!” With a proposal like this who would say no?CLICK PAGE 2 TO WATCH THE VIDEO",

However, the rich girl derisively rejected him and said, ” Your monthly salary is equivalent to my daily expenses. How do you expect me to marry someone like you? I can never love you so forget about me. Go find and marry someone else of your level.”Despite being rejected so hurtfully, for some reason, the boy could not forget her easily.Roughly 10 years later, they ran into each other accidentally in a shopping mall.She immediately recognized the man and said, “Hey, how are you? I’m now married to a very smart man, and his salary is $15,700 per month! Can you beat that?”The man, hearing those painful words from the woman he used to care for, held back his tears and said nothing.Not a few moments passed when the woman’s husband came back to her side. But before the lady could say a word, her husband immediately recognized the man she was talking to and said, “Sir? G-good afternoon! I see you’ve met my wife!”“Good afternoon too, Mr…?”, said the man.“Mr. Carter, Sir!”The husband then turned to his wife and said, “Dear, I’d like you to meet my boss. He owns the $100 million project I’ve been working on!”The woman, left flabbergasted by the turn of events, was not able to say anything back.The man just smiled and said, “Well, Mr. Carter. I’ve got to get going. I have important things to attend to. It was splendid seeing you today. Have a great day!”For a minute, the couple just stared at the man as he walked away.<imageanchor=”1″> </imageanchor=”1″>Having been over her initial shock, the woman asked her husband in disbelief, “That was your boss?”“Yes, dear. He’s a very humble person but his life is quite a sad story. They said he once loved a lady but she dumped him because he was just a poor boy back then. Because of that, he worked really hard. And because he’s smart, he became successful. Now he’s a multimillionaire who earns millions of dollars a month. Unfortunately though, he couldn’t move on from that heartbreak and remains unmarried still.”The husband went on and said, “How lucky would that lady have been if she had married that man?”",

    "body": "Christmas brings out the best in people. It is indeed the season of giving, making everyone a tad bit more generous than usual. One particular local government unit did its best to make sure that every kid within its jurisdiction gets a merry Christmas. The local government of Laguna, like they always do, decided to hold a gift-giving and feeding program for malnourished children on December 18. As is the way with local government units, the Laguna government had a tarpaulin made to announce the charity event. To everyone’s delight, the announcement immediately went trending on social media, but not for the well-meaning reasons behind it.Take a look at their hilariously-worded tarpaulin below!According to a report by GMA News Online, the network reached out to Governor Ramil Hernandez whose name appears on the tarp to ask about the announcement. However, it was his social media manager who replied to the network, explaining the intended meaning of the hilarious word that made the tarp trending. “Ang ibig sabihin ng cum dito ay ‘comes with’,” his manager explained.The news website was then referred to Ms. Arlet Estrosa, the Laguna government’s head of its Gender and Development Program.In the same report, the sweet 44 year-old lady was said to have quickly clarified what they meant when they had the word printed on the tarp: “Together with’ ang ibig sabihin namin duon sa ‘cum’.” She also shared that their government has been using that particular word for their previous programs too, but this is the first time that an announcement from them went trending because of it.She explained:“Wala talagang malisya, kasi ‘together with’ naman talaga ang ibig [sabihin] ng salita. Talagang nagulat na lang kami – hindi pa ako nakakapag-check ng Facebook, may tumawag na lang sa akin.”The word ‘cum’ is actually a preposition which has roots from the Latin language. Its use gained popularity in the 19th century. In Latin, it literally means ‘with’ or ‘together with’. This explains why the word is often used in giving out academic honors such as ‘cum laude’ – which means ‘with praise’ or ‘with honor’.A variant of the meaning of the word became more popular than its original, and for good reason. The word ‘cum’ as a noun that means ‘semen or other product of orgasm’ officially went on record in the 1920s. Nowadays, it has become a slang term for when men ejaculate during sexual intercourse.When Estrosa was asked if she knew the sexual meaning of the word, she vehemently denied it, saying, “Hindi po talaga. Hindi po talaga. Wala po talaga sa amin ang may alam.” In fact, she even asked the news website who reached out to her for help with their local government unit to clarify the meaning of the word for everyone!“Tulungan niyo po kami ma-clarify kung ano talaga ang ibig sabihin namin.”Estrosa also said that moving forward, she will never use the word for her programs again. Isn’t she just the cutest?What can you say about this hilarious announcement by the government of Laguna? Sound off in the comments section below!",

Mouth stuffed with money.Rappler was also targeted by the ire of netizens for allegedly protecting the senator.One netizen said, “ladies and gentlemen, mga kababayan, this is what spinning to condition the minds of the people is all about.

This online new entity has taken the role of fault-finder in the Duterte presidency to the point of neglecting critical thinking, which is a very important aspect of Thought Leadership. I am amused.”As Rappler’s founder, Maria Ressa was bashed for her editorial choices that have led to Rappler seemingly trying to protect a staunch Duterte critic.Netizen Mike Acebedo Lopez posted Rappler’s article on Trillens’ BBC interview and wrote a caption saying, “most of us have seen the BBC interview, a grand display of feeblemindedness and a much-deserved paring down of the senate stooge, yet this is Maria’s Rappler’s takeaway.

    "body": "A plan by President Rodrigo Duterte to declare a nationwide martial law received overwhelming support from filipino's around the world and urges him to protect the country from leftlist and communist.In a statement, the CPP said Duterte was becoming “increasingly desperate amid broad rising calls for his ouster” and “seeks to prop himself up as a fascist dictator in his despair to cling to power.”Duterte earlier said he would be forced to impose martial law nationwide if the Left stage massive protests that might turn unruly.However, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Friday allayed fears of another nationwide martial law saying it was a “remote possibility”.But the CPP said the president “deserves the strongest condemnation for threatening to make full use of the military and police to carry out armed repression against mass demonstrations by conjuring a scenario of ‘rebels taking to the streets’ and ‘fighting on the streets’.””Having imposed martial law in Mindanao, Duterte believes he can get away with nationwide martial law. The Filipino people are determined to prove him wrong. Under the slogan ‘Never again to martial law!’, various forces are bound to rapidly come together against the Duterte regime as it carries out increasingly tyrannical measures,” the underground group said.The president declared martial law in Mindanao on May 23, the same day the Islamic State-inspired Maute group started a siege in Marawi City which has entered its fourth month.The CPP accused Duterte of establishing himself as a dictator “by silencing the political opposition,” among other moves.It noted that his allies in Congress have “railroaded” the National ID system, canceled the scheduled barangay elections to enable him to “supplant tens of thousands of village officials with his loyalists” and “acted swiftly to impeach the chief justice as an overt threat to make the Supreme Court and judiciary bow to Malacañang’s whims.”The CPP said “Duterte is presently carrying out a mind-conditioning campaign to justify his plan to impose martial law.”“Through mostly foul means, he has silenced critical opinion in mass media. He employs his horde of paid trolls to flood social media with Duterte adulation and to vilify the Left and political opposition,” it said.“He uses government money to build his Kilusang Pagbabago propaganda machinery and Masa Masid (now renamed Community Mobilization Project, comparable to the Alsa Masa movement in Davao City) spy network. The police and military control the flow of information. In the guise of stopping ‘fake news,’ the regime is set to clamp down on media freedom and the right to free expression,” it added.The CPP said Duterte and his security officials will try to “suppress the protest actions and prevent these from swelling into large demonstrations.”“In the face of his desperation, it is not remote that Duterte and his dirty tricks department will resort to creating bloody trouble in the streets to serve as pretext for the declaration of martial law,” it warned.The CPP statement on Thursday was the strongest so far against Duterte after the president declared on July 21 that he was abandoning peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front.He also ordered the arrest of NDF peace consultants who were freed on bail so they could give inputs during the talks.“No more talk. Let us fight. I’ll save enough money for the arms, I’ll buy the new ones, the precision guided missiles,” he said.Duterte made the declaration shortly after New People’s Army rebels ambushed a convoy of the Presidential Security Group along the Davao-Bukidnon highway.A day before Duterte’s announcement, the CPP said the declaration of martial law in Mindanao has made the talks unnecessary.“It is a strongman’s act of bad faith aimed at bullying the NDFP to bow to his terms of surrender,” it said.“Having failed to inveigle the NDFP to capitulate in the peace negotiations, he is offering so-called local peace talks in the vain attempt to entice revolutionary forces with deceptive offers,” the CPP said in the statement Thursday.Presidential daughter and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio has said she will pursue localized talks with the NPA.The NPA, armed wing of the CPP, has been waging an armed struggle since 1969.Ferdinand E. Marcos was the first president to place the entire country under martial law, from Sept. 21, 1972 until his ouster via a civilian-backed military mutiny in February 1986.Marcos abolished Congress and ruled by decree, in effect, arrogating unto himself the powers of the executive, legislature and judiciary.",

    "body": "With all the negative noise being created by critics of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and his government – much of it from the Western media and more than enough of it from local media – it’s easy to lose sight of the positive changes taking place across the Philippines. And there are many.Below, is a snapshot of just 50 of them. What they show is that the Philippines is not in some eternal night of the Goths, as many would have the world believe. These developments improve, in some way, the daily lives of millions of people.The government’s socio-economic plan, designed to provide a fair and equitable society, address the problems of poverty and boost the middle class, is being put into action. This involves a major shake-up of the public sector and the introduction of a new work culture by which public employees – from immigration officers to municipal clerks – serve the people, rather than exploit or harass them as has hitherto been the practice.At the same time, real progress is being made to create a safe and stable environment – not just for Filipinos but also for those who want to do business there. This cannot be faithfully delivered if the deeply entrenched problems of illegal drugs, crime and insurgency are not first tackled head on. For the same reason, corruption, monopolies and other protectionist practices in the corporate arena are also being dealt with. This battle will be stepped up in due course.In effect, what Duterte and his colleagues are engaged in here is a programme of national reconstruction. Their intention is to do away with the stubborn remnants of a feudal system that dates back to Spanish colonisation and usher in a modern era.A vibrant economy cannot be delivered, however, while between 3 and 4 million people are using crystal meth; while illegal-drug lords seek to turn the Philippines into another Colombian cash cow; while terror fanatics are left to hold, not just individuals, but the economy, its tourism, and the country’s image to ransom; while oligarchs and influential clans treat Philippine commerce as their own private fiefdom; while economic disparity is allowed to exist as if its just some fact of life; while civil servants treat departments of government like their own private businesses; while corruption and waste continue to permeate the public sector, rewarding indolence and cheating and hobbling all hopes of efficiency and transparency.These are all big items, but there is no question that Duterte and his team are fully committed to these efforts. And they’re not wasting any time. The contents of this snapshot have been achieved in less than 90 days.Drugs War: 1. Some 700,000 illegal-drug workers and addicts have surrendered. 2. Drugs worth billions of dollars seized. 3. Drug labs dismantled across the country. 4. Crackdown of the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) natcotics trade. 5. Private sector pledges cash for drug-rehabilitation centres. 6. Drugs-war effort, Oplan Tokhang (approach and talk), launched in gated communities.Employment related: 7. Companies told to end contractualisation. 8. Age-limit requirements for jobs stopped. 9. Employment rate rises.Increased transparency/efficiency: 10. Signing of Freedom of Information Act. 11. Corrupt government, military, police and corporate officials publicly named. 12. Installation of CCTV across Customs Department facilities. 13. Services by government agencies speeded up; respect for the public improved. 14. Centralised complaint and action hotlines (911 and 8888) introduced.Land/rural workers: 15. Long-overdue distribution of Hacienda Luisita land to local farmers. 16. Agricultural equipment, purchased by previous government, finally distributed. 17. Provisions of irrigation projects for farmers/boats for fishermen started nationwide. 18. Removal of fishing fences in Manila Bay to help small fishermen’s livelihoods. 19. Gates to Department of Agrarian Reform in Quezon City removed after 18 years of preventing farmers’ access. 20. Shutdown/closure of environment-damaging mining companies.Overseas Foreign Workers (OFWs): 21. Overseas Employment Certificate exemption for OFWs returning to same employer. 22. Immediate repatriation of stranded OFWs in Saudi Arabia. 23. First one-stop-shop for OFWs at Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. 24. Balikbayan boxes (overseas packages) no longer mishandled and stolen from.Peace/ law and order: 25. Indefinite ceasefire with Muslim groups (MNLF, MILF) and communist groups (CPP, NDF). 26. Government peace talks with Muslim and communist groups held in Norway. 27. Mindanao peace process resumed in Malaysia. 28. Bilateral talks with China over disputed sea territories. 29. Relations with Indonesia put back on track. 30. Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police replaces ineffective Bureau of Correction guards at NBP. 31. Drop in the number of street crimes. 32. Curfew hours imposed for minors.Servicemen/police: 33. Proposed salary increase for servicemen. 34. Proposed state-of-the-art hospital for servicemen. 35. Benefit claims by families of fallen servicemen speeded up. 36. Pay rates for members of the Philippine National Police raised.Taxation: 37. Crackdown on tax evaders. 38. Tax-avoiding online gambling stopped. 39. Standard 10% income tax rate to be introduced.Travel: 40. Dept. of Foreign Affairs speeds-up passport processing. 41. Passport validity extended to 10 years. 42. Removal of processing fee for travel-tax exemptions. 43. Tanim bala (planting bullets in airport luggage) stopped once Duterte took office. 44. New Manila airport buses to major hubs in nearby cities. 45. VIP treatment at airports for government officials ended. 46. Improvements to MRT/LRT services.Welfare/assistance: 47. Twelve government agencies to focus on poverty, centralised under Cabinet Secretary, Leoncio Evasco Jr. 48. Social Security System pension raised by PHP2,000. 49. One sack of rice added to government “4Ps” poverty-alleviation programme. 50. Increased allowances for Olympic delegates.There is a long way to go and the current administration is the first to admit it. But the government is also pledged to see this work through – with of without the consent and approval of CNN, CNBC, the BBC and their fraternity. After all, this is not their country; irrespective of the outcome, their lives will not be affected. The lives of the Filipino people, however, will and that’s what is driving this government to cure the ills of the past. And for investors, that knowledge should be very reassuring. Certainly one thing they already know is that the success of their investment portfolios is of no interest to CNN, CNBC, the BBC and their fraternity.",

    "body": "Posted by Courtney JesterPosted on Saturday, February 15th, 2014A high-ranking general of the Armed Forces of the Philippines today said that an invasion of Hong Kong, if so ordered by the President, can be successful given the current equipment the Philippines has.The military official spoke to Eritas Times today, under condition of anonymity, during a courtesy call at the Philippine Military’s General Headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City.The unnamed General said that the Philippines is capable of launching a surprise attack on Hong Kong since it is only a few hundred miles away, and can be executed in a such a way that personnel are not detected until the moment of attack, achieving complete surprise.The General said that the Philippines has thousands of rubber and pump boats at its disposal, and can be deployed in fairly short notice. He also said that Philippine soldiers are trained well on the use of these boats for modern warfare since it has been the primary mode of sea transport used by the military in its campaign against insurgent elements in the southern provinces.“The morale is high, and Philippine soldiers are ready,” the General said.At the lower ranks, Col. Pacifico Palayfay, commander of the 306th Marine “Fighting Boatmen” Division said that his men are ready for any challenge given to them by the President.“We have been training with the aid of scenes from the US Navy SEALs movie ‘Act of Valor’ and the recent ‘Lone Survivor’ to get some tips and pointers on survival and attack tactics,” Palayfay said. “Just give us a mission and we will accomplish it,” he added.According to a leaked report from J4 (Logistics), Eritas Times has learned that the inventory of rubber and pump boats were close to 10,000 units in October of 2013. However, after super typhoon Yolanda hit the southern part of the Philippines, this number has decreased to a mere 600 vessels.Meanwhile, Presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda, when asked about the statements made by the general, would not comment saying it was the first time he heard of such a claim, and he would like to look into the matter first before commenting.",

Despite fair warnings that the anti-Duterte TV ads placed by Trillanes may violate the senses of the Filipino people, the ethics committee of ABS-CBN still proceeded to approve and air it. It was disapproved during the second screening but somebody out there managed to have the committee overturn its earlier decision.

There are many forms of child maltreatment, including neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, exploitation, and emotional abuse. Points against ABS-CBN & GMA 1) The only reason for ABS-CBN News to allow a vice presidentiable to air negative ads against a presidentiable is that ABS is complicit to the widespread and systematic concerted demolition job against Mayor Rody Duterte; 2) The Networks is circumventing the Right to Reply provision of the Fair Elections Act by airing these ads because it deprives Mayor Rody Duterte the chance to defend himself in a similar forum due to timing as well as format of the negative attacks; and 3) The airing of these ads would prove that ABS-CBN and GMA is bias against the candidacy of Mayor Duterte and is using its franchise to further the cause of the candidate it favors. 4.)

    "body": "TANDAG CITY, SURIGAO DEL SUR – It is an open secret that many priests of the Diocese of Tandag are no longer living celibate chastity. A number of cases are publicly known that one might say that most diocesan priests either don’t believe in celibacy anymore or have given up the struggle to be chaste. The hallowed ‘priestly image’ is now a thing of the past. Scandal after scandal involving priests continues unabated prompting many Catholics to express concern over the rampant immoral acts.As people become more enlightened, there will be a crisis of faith, perhaps a sudden collapse, with many leaving the Catholic church either to join other churches or to become agnostics, especially in the highly educated middle class.If the number of catholic priests of the Diocese of Tandag who are sexually active or have families and children will leave priesthood, there will be a massive shortage of priests to perform masses. Almost everywhere we hear of unedifying stories of priests ‘sexploits’ and other form of vices that puts to shame the exploits of ordinary men engaged in the same vices. These stories are told as anecdotes, gossips and by media. They are told within the parishes and beyond. They are told at home in families, in schools, in barbershops and hair salons and in public markets.And what is being talked about? Priests’ secret and not so secret liaisons with girls and women, coerced sex with housemaids, with students, with relatives; priests ‘wives’ set up in well furnished homes; priests involved with a parishioner’s wife; of priests romantically involved with nuns; priests offering money for sex and so on… A fair number of priests children are scattered around the province and beyond who are carefully hidden from view and these children are forced to call their father-priests as ‘uncle’ to hide the ugly truth from the prying eye of the public.Apologists and defenders of priests argue that they are also people and therefore vulnerable to worldly sins. True, but they should have thought about it before they decided to enter priesthood. Unlike ordinary mortals, priests are placed in a higher plane or pedestal and are therefore expected to act accordingly. It is hard for people to reconcile expectations with facts when a number of priests have sexual relationship with multiple women at the same time. Moreso, when priests have multiple children from different women. What is worse is that they have done and are still doing it using church money collected from the faithful. Talk of the faithful financing the unfaithful ways of men of faith!A religious parishioner from Tandag City who refused to be identified disclosed that there seems to be a culture of deception and silence within the diocese of Tandag. The priests are trying to project and portray a hallowed image when the same is clearly contradicted by what is on the ground. The sin of deception is of course not tenable for much longer. There is an ominous and unhealthy conspiracy of silence about these matters among the Tandag diocesan clergy and the faithful alike. The laity, for all their good will, is also co-opted into this unwholesome silence, sometimes for lack of information, sometimes because they believe that they have some ‘moral’ duty to be loyal to an imperfect church. In truth, their silence shores up and encourage the sins of priests and destroy many lives.",

    "body": "Recently, a video of a certain Keaton Jones pouring his heart out to his mom about his bullying experience with bullies made rounds in social media. The parent put it up online in hopes of enlightening the public how bullying affects children. While the clip was upsetting to watch, many found the story inspirational. Hollywood big names such as Justin Bieber, Mark Hamill, Millie Bobby Brown, and Delanie Walker came to the poor child’s defense. Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo, who are known for their superhero characters Captain America and Hulk, respectively, even went as far as inviting the mother and son on the screening of their new film “Avengers: Infinity War”.The inspirational story, however, took a turn when the family, particularly his mom Kimberly, became involved in a slew of controversies. Racist accusations were pointed at her after a previous Facebook status she allegedly posted surfaced online. In the said status, the parent was seen holding a Confederate flag and wrote a statement that reads:“Dear butt hurt Americans, If you aren’t bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying! For the love, some folks clearly never picked a switch. And before y’all start talking to me about metaphorical, emotional, financial or historical blood & brokenness, Don’t. Join a group.”It was influential African-American activist Tariq Nasheed who spread the news on Twitter by tweeting a screenshot of the Jones family proudly holding the Confederate flag from Kim’s Facebook account. He wrote:“That viral video of #KeatonJones talking about being bullied is heartbreaking, and I feel sympathetic towards that child. But his mom, Kimberly on the other hand, is a suspected racist who makes very problematic posts bullying Black protesters #TheIrony“.The Facebook page was deactivated after the said tweet circulated rapidly. The GoFundMe page addressed to the family was also put to a halt.A reply to actress Patricia Arquette written by Keaton’s sister Lakyn denied the claims of Keaton bullying his black classmates. She said that they do not condone bigotry in the family.“Those who know me and my family know we aren’t racist. My brother doesn’t say the “N” word. Please leave it alone”.In addition to the tweet was the sister claiming that a fake Instagram account of her mom was set up.“The Instagram KimberlyJones_38 is NOT my mom. She has a private Instagram and hasn’t talked to anyone. We haven’t received any money and don’t plan on it. The gofundme’saren’t by any of us.”In a report from the Daily Mail, Lakyn stood up for her mother by saying that she’s not racist, and that she’s “just a strong southern woman”.As expected, the accusations caused a storm in social media. Here are some of the netizens’ comments.What can you say about this reaction from Keaton Jones’ family following racist accusations? Do you think that the mother is guilty as charged? How about the child being suspected of bullying his black classmates? Let us know your thoughts and reactions down in the comment section!",

Her hand did not actually made contact with the crotch in question but that doesn't make it less naughty.In an episode of Eat! Bulaga, during a segment in which the Maine and Alden, better known as AlDub, are co-hosts, a supposedly private joke was caught on cam and was shown on live TV. It was only for a brief moment and is obviously not meant to be shown on camera but it did. A page dedicated to all things AlDub had it recorded was posted on social media where it garnered thousands of reactions from fans and non-fans alike.The grabbing clip eventually led to speculations to Mendoza and Richards real-life relationship while some says that it was unbecoming of a well adored public figure whom many of the youth idolize.On the other hand, majority of the couple's fans took it as a harmless fun between the two and does not deem it to be offensive or that big of a deal.Here's the clip showingthat was shown on live TV.",

    "body": "As soon as Vicki Belo introduced her daughter to the public, Scarlet Snow has captivated the hearts of many. At a young age of two, the child is already a huge star on social media, with her Instagram garnering over 1.8 million followers. With her undeniable charm and irresistible face, many netizens go loco over the instant-celebrity youngster.As a matter of fact, last Saturday when the mother and daughter duo became a hot topic online after Vicki posted a clip of the child star.She wrote:“It breaks my heart when scarletsnowbelo is disappointed but we cannot spoil her right ?”In the video, a very cute Scarlet was sulking over her mother’s refusal to spoil her. The mother was heard saying in the clip:“Will you hug me and kiss me, Scarlet? With plenty and plenty of kisses? How many kisses?”But the child, who was obviously disappointed, replied with “one only” and walked out of the room.While it was regrettable for Vicki, netizens showered her with only praise for opting to discipline Scarlet at such a young age. Here are some of their comments:“Why only one? What does she need doctora? Haha she’s so cute magtampo. And you’re right. It’s good to start early sa pagdidisiplina kesa sa malaki na siya , mas mahihirapan kayo lalo na’t sikat siya and she’s got everything she needs serve in front of her. 🙂 victoria_belo i wonder what she needed hahaha” “that’s right po Dra. victoria_belo Dra. Vicky ganyan po ako biglang quiet pag nag Tampo 🙂 LOVE you Dra. Vicky and Cuteeeee baby” “Tama po kayo , This is a way of disciplining her and letting her know at the young age na you cannot always have what you want agad-agad . Good job! maamvictoria_belo [hearts emoji] [thumbs up emoji]”Indeed a majority of Dra. Vicki Belo ‘s followers commended the celebrity doctor for not giving in to her daughter’s tantrum and spoil her. They agreed that, while it is a bit heartbreaking to see your child sulk, discipline needs to be taught an early age. Any parent knows that these are the lessons all children need during their formative years.As one netizen and self-professed nanny commented, “It’s for their own good po.”We tend to agree since Scarlett has her whole life ahead of her.See the very cute clip for yourself here.Truly, Vicki is wise to instill discipline on her daughter at an early age, regardless of their family’s affluence.What can you say about Vicki Belo not wanting to spoil her daughter? How about on the clip of the cute Scarlet Snow sulking over a toy? Let us know your thoughts and reactions by leaving them below in the comment section!",

    "body": "40 SHARES Share TweetPia Wurtzbach‘s camp finally broke their silence regarding her half-brother’s claims that she was lying about her life story which was featured in ABS-CBN’s longest-running drama-anthology Maalaala Mo Kaya. Almost every Filipino tuned in to the 2015 Miss Universe‘s story aired on June 3. Her role was portrayed by rising star Liza Soberano which added to the episode’s high ratings.However, the beauty queen received a lot of criticism, both good and bad, for how she chose to tell her side of the story. One of the people who gave her negative feedback, and caused quite a controversy, is her half-brother Alexander Wurtzbach. Alexander took to Facebook to rant about the MMK episode, saying that Pia was lying about the part wherein their father, Uwe Wurtzbach, cheated on her mom and was asking for financial assistance from her.Loading...A lot of her fans were quick to defend Pia from her brother’s allegations, saying that the MMK story about the former Miss Universe’s life is all true. In fact, her sister Sarah Wurtzbach allegedly defended her from their half-brother by posting a status on her own Facebook account.Although she did not directly state that the message is for Alexander, it’s pretty obvious that it is judging by the time she posted it.With all these controversies and unanswered issues, an unnamed source from the Miss Universe’s camp finally spoke out about the incident.Loading...On Monday, June 5, PEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal) received a message from a source who is very close to Pia. According to the unnamed source, every scene from the MMK episode about Pia’s life is real especially the part where her father asked for money from her when she won as 1st runner-up in Bb. Pilipinas 2013. The source also stated that Uwe even asked Pia to pay for Alexander’s tuition fee when he was still studying.The source said:Loading...“This was during the Binibini days.I’m sure not a lot of people know, but when you are 1st runner-up, wala ka ding pera from winnings ‘coz technically you don’t have a crown.So, Pia said she couldn’t help.”In addition, the source said that her sister Sarah, who was living in the United Kingdom during that time, sent Pia some money for her daily needs which proves that the beauty queen was trying to make ends meet pre-Miss Universe days.So far, it looks as though everyone is on the Miss Universe’s side regarding this issue.",

Moreover, the mere deletion of its online version does not in any way affect the fact that PSN has published the column on paper.If a news site deletes an article without an accompanying erratum, does that mean it also retracts that article?No. It doesn’t.For one, I highly doubt that PSN has recalled or will recall all the newspapers it printed on October 30th.

Moreover, a significant remark like that would've been captured by mainstream media and not released through bloggers, fake news websites and tabloid columns. Let us be more discerning about these things.\" Let’s break it down.In light of the previous sections, Trillanes basically said three things:Pilipino Star Ngayon publishes fake news because it “can’t even cite the news outfit that conducted the interview”. Senior US government officials would not meet with Trillanes if he had dubious credentials. A significant remark would’ve been captured by mainstream media and not through bloggers, fake news websites, and tabloid columns.First, Pilipino Star Ngayon as “Fake News” One thing is clear at this point:Now, I’m curious as to how PhilStar Daily Inc. will defend Pilipino Star Ngayon’s Al Pedroche.After all, a newspaper that has been given Gawad Tanglaw awards for “Newspaper of the Year” for two consecutive years (2013 and 2014) cannot be considered “fake news”, as that would imply that there’s something anomalous about Gawad Tanglaw.Surely, the “Moreover, it’s hypocritical for Trillanes to demand such standards when he himself is guilty of forwarding dubious claims in the very recent past.Take, for example, the “BPI Julia Vargas” issue , where he claimed that then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte amassed over a billion pesos in ill-gotten wealth. Asked for his source, he executed an affidavit stating that he got the information from a certain “Joseph de Mesa” who, in turn, got it from an unnamed AMLC official [Mister Trillanes, should I have cited Joseph de Mesa too?

Hence, the question should be whether Pilipino Star ngayon is part of “mainstream media”. Some readers, however, requested for my source, so I tried to retrieve Pedroche’s column and voila! I discovered that the PSN took it down.PSN, however, did not issue a retraction or even an erratum, so it’s safe to conclude that PSN stands by what PSN editor-in-chief Pedroche wrote.

Enough said. did not break that news: it was Pilipino Star Ngayon. Hence, the question should be whether Pilipino Star ngayon is part of “mainstream media”.While there is no strict definition of what belongs to mainstream media or not, it must be recalled that Pilipino Star Ngayon’s Ely Saludar was made president of the Malacañang Press Corps, replacing Tony Velasquez of ABS-CBN [ Star ].If that’s not mainstream enough for Trillanes, I do not know what else is.And surely, the tabloid reporters belonging to the Malacañang Press Corps will refute Trillanes’ claim that tabloids publish fake news.But wait, there's more!Today, broadsheet columnist Mary Ann Reyes of the Philippine Star, on“While onboard Air Force One, Trump was reportedly asked by a reporter about Trillanes’ visit to the US and this is what the President said: ‘The little narco met with Senator Marco (referring to US Senator Marco Rubio).’” So now, Mister Trillanes, is the broadsheet Philippine Star still not mainstream enough for you? But wait, there's more!Today, broadsheet columnist Mary Ann Reyes of the Philippine Star, on her 01 November 2017 column , wrote:So now, Mister Trillanes, is the broadsheet Philippine Star still not mainstream enough for you?Wow! Ang taas ng standards ni Kuya. Wish ko lang e inapply niya ‘yang standards na ‘yan sa sarili niya.But the story doesn’t end here because I noticed something really fishy.Sneaky! Sneaky!

Interestingly, both articles DID NOT mention Pedroche’s 30 October 2017 PSN column, which pre-dated the Adobo Chronicles article.Now, the two reporters could have argued that they didn’t get to read Pedroche’s PSN piece because it was deleted.The two reporters’ apparent omission of the Pilipino Star Ngayon column could have been an honest mistake. After all, Hanlon’s Razor [“Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.” But surely, neither of the reporters will admit to being stupid, so malice, though not yet a certitude at this point, could have been present. But the story doesn’t end here because I noticed something really fishy.This afternoon, [ GMA News ] and the [ Philippine Star ] published news articles about Trillanes’ statement-slash-denial, and I saw a very interesting pattern.Both articles contain the following basic talking points and basically in the same order:Interestingly, both articles DID NOT mention Pedroche’s 30 October 2017 PSN column, which pre-dated the Adobo Chronicles article.Now, the two reporters could have argued that they didn’t get to read Pedroche’s PSN piece because it was deleted.The two reporters’ apparent omission of the Pilipino Star Ngayon column could have been an honest mistake.

But wait, there's more!On 31 October 2017, or a day before the two articles were published, veteran journalist Jojo Robles of the [ Manila Standard ], another mainstream broadsheet, talked about Pedroche’s piece when he wrote:That is, the two reporters seemingly ignored not only the original PSN piece, but also another column piece from another mainstream publication.Did the two reporters commit the same “honest mistake” twice?I don’t know, but any self-respecting beat reporter should read all the major stories in the major dailies before she goes to work.As far as I can see, they either acted with malice, or they’re simply incompetent and lazy.But who would admit to being incompetent and lazy?A Possible Damage Control Plan To help get a better grasp of what’s going on, let me summarize the basic chain of events:October 30th: Pilipino Star Ngayon publishes article claiming Trump called Trillanes a “narco”. October 31st : , using PSN as a source, reported that Trump allegedly called Trillanes a \"narco”. October 31st: Manila Standard cites the Pilipino Star column piece. October 31st: Adobo Chronicles satirizes the “narco” story. November 1st: Broadsheet Philippine Star picks up the “narco” story. Now, the two news articles did not mention steps 1 and 3, so that their timeline will only include Steps 2, 4, and 5.In short, a possible public relations damage control plan for the Trillanes camp could be inspired by what happened to Manila Times columnist Yen Makabenta last month, where the latterTrillanes' potential strategy can be described using the following steps:First , find a way to get the Pedroche’s PSN column deleted, making it appear that the column piece never existed., find a way to get the Pedroche’s PSN column deleted, making it appear that the column piece never existed. Second , make it appear that Adobo Chronicles broke the news, which would basically discredit the story because Adobo Chronicles is widely known to be a satirical news site., make it appear that Adobo Chronicles broke the news, which would basically discredit the story because Adobo Chronicles is widely known to be a satirical news site. Third , with the Adobo satirical article up, discredit any further mention of the “narco” quote by making it appear that whoever will write about it got duped by Adobo., with the Adobo satirical article up, discredit any further mention of the “narco” quote by making it appear that whoever will write about it got duped by Adobo. Fourth , to stave off claims that PSN broke the news, discredit PSN by calling it a mere tabloid, without directly naming PSN so Trillanes can avoid incurring the wrath of the Philstar Group., to stave off claims that PSN broke the news, discredit PSN by calling it a mere tabloid, without directly naming PSN so Trillanes can avoid incurring the wrath of the Philstar Group. Fifth, focus the attention and blame on . After all, finding mainstream media outlets to join in this attack against  will be easy. In short, the strategy revolves around the premise that  and Adobo Chronicles broke the story, even if it’s Pilipino Star Ngayon that did and even if the Manila Standard has referred to PSN’s column a day later.Just likeIf the Little Narco story is fake news, why can't Trillanes confront PHILIPPINE STAR about it? Bakit si  ay pinag-iinitan niya, eh Philippine Star ang nag-publish? But there’s one fatal flaw in this possible plan: Trillanes’ initial choice of mainstream allies. To help get a better grasp of what’s going on, let me summarize the basic chain of events:Now, the two news articles did not mention steps 1 and 3, so that their timeline will only include Steps 2, 4, and 5.In short, a possible public relations damage control plan for the Trillanes camp could be inspired by what happened to Manila Times columnist Yen Makabenta last month, where the latter got duped by Fake News about a supposed quote from United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.Trillanes' potential strategy can be described using the following steps:In short, the strategy revolves around the premise that  and Adobo Chronicles broke the story, even if it’s Pilipino Star Ngayon that did and even if the Manila Standard has referred to PSN’s column a day later.Just like what my friend Sass Sasot said But there’s one fatal flaw in this possible plan: Trillanes’ initial choice of mainstream allies.Inday Sara Duterte reveals Trillanes Press Corps? Trillanes initially found two (unwitting?) allies:Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez of GMA news Kristine Joy Patag of the Philippine Star.These two reporters wrote the two denial-articles published yesterday.Now, let’s simplify the question:Did the two reporters (Star’s Patag and GMA’s Alvarez) intentionally omit two crucial sources (PSN and Standard) of the “little narco” comment? I checked theYes, Alvarez and Patag appear to be in the Senate Beat, i.e. they are focused mainly on news coming from or about the Senate of the Philippines.Now, recall that presidential daughter and Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte earlier this month Now, let’s simplify the question:I checked the list of Philippine Star news articles authored by Kristine Joy Patag and I found out that a vast majority of them are about or are sourced from the Senate, suggesting that Patag is a Senate beat reporter. I also checked the list of GMA News articles and found out the same about Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez, i.e. she appears to be another Senate beat reporter.Yes, Alvarez and Patag appear to be in the Senate Beat, i.e. they are focused mainly on news coming from or about the Senate of the Philippines.Now, recall that presidential daughter and Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte earlier this month wrote a Facebook comment , shown below:Part of that comment reads:“Wala si Trillanes pag weekend, walang mainstream media for a presscon kung weekend. Ang bayad ke Trillanes, Monday to Friday before evening news cut-off. Most people watch news and read newspapers Monday to Friday.”It's worthy to note that NO ONE among the senate beat reporters, where Patag and Alvarez belong, reported about Inday Sara's comment, even if it directly concerns them.News blackout much?Well, one thing’s for sure: Patag’s and Alvarez’s respective articles made the evening news cut-off.And did I say that neither of them attempted to contact me for my side of the story?Well, what's new?Bam Aquino, ikaw ang makulit sa pagkuha kamo dapat ng both sides, so papaluin mo kaya yung dalawang ungas na yan?Trillanes' payroll?It's funny how some mainstream outlets claimed during the #CocoyGate senate hearing that they have internal ombudsmen who check for abuses within their their ranks. However, I have never heard, seen, or read anybody among them getting fired for corruption.Should we start canonizing a number of mainstream journalists?At this rate, yeah, I think we should!Are Kristine Joy Patag of the Philippine Star and Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez of GMA News part of Trillanes’ alleged payroll? I can’t say for sure, and I leave that job to the “internal ombudsmen” of the concerned news outlets, assuming that such “internal ombudsmen” exist. Now, wouldn’t it be fair to ask the question:I can’t say for sure, and I leave that job to the “internal ombudsmen” of the concerned news outlets, assuming that such “internal ombudsmen” exist.But I am a nice guy, so let me help these theoretically existent “internal ombudsmen” a bit.Who is GMA News’ Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez? GMA’s Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez drew flak last month when she broke the news about Senator Trillanes’ visit to a Singaporean Bank.On 19 September 2017, Alvarez wrote “No such account, Singapore bank tells Trillanes [Alvarez’s article was accompanied by a [That is, unless the Alvarez is based in Singapore, she must have flown to Singapore to cover Trillanes’ trip.Supporting this theory is a line from Alvarez’s article that reads:“The branch manager then talked to Trillanes for about 10 minutes.” From this, we can say that Alvarez was there to witness the event, as this appears to be Alvarez’s direct observation of events as they unfolded.So who paid for Alvarez’s trip to Singapore? The Philippine Star? Antonio Trillanes? Who?Trillanes has his own Press Corps? Kinabog si Duterte?! Taray!Is Alvarez one of the reporters on the Trillanes’ payroll that Inday Sara Duterte alleged?GMA News “Internal Ombudsman”, GO!!!But wait! We’re not done yet.Who is Philippine Star’s Kristine Joy Patag? According toShe was promoted to Presidential Staff Officer III in May 2014, and left the Office of the President when her principal, President Benigno “PNoy” Aquino III stepped down in June 2016.As a presidential staff officer, she said her tasks include:Drafting messages and correspondence for the signature of the President.Drafting action letters, transmittal memorandums, and referrals to other units for the signature of the Head of Office.Researching, verifying, and coordinating with concerned offices accordingly.Editing and proofreading diplomatic correspondences sent to Heads of States for the signature of the President. That is, for the first six years of her work life and using the standards of today’s political oppositon, Patag was officially a government propagandist, similar to the Mikael de Lara Co, whom I wrote about in April 2016 when he lamely defended the Aquino Government for the Kidapawan Carnage [But I digress. GMA’s Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez drew flak last month when she broke the news about Senator Trillanes’ visit to a Singaporean Bank.On 19 September 2017, Alvarez wrote “No such account, Singapore bank tells Trillanes [ GMA News ]”.Alvarez’s article was accompanied by a [ Twitter video ] showing Trillanes entering the Alexandra, Singapore branch of DBS bank. Alvarez did not attribute this video to anyone else, so she must have taken the video herself.That is, unless the Alvarez is based in Singapore, she must have flown to Singapore to cover Trillanes’ trip.Supporting this theory is a line from Alvarez’s article that reads:From this, we can say that Alvarez was there to witness the event, as this appears to be Alvarez’s direct observation of events as they unfolded.So who paid for Alvarez’s trip to Singapore? The Philippine Star? Antonio Trillanes? Who?Is Alvarez one of the reporters on the Trillanes’ payroll that Inday Sara Duterte alleged?GMA News “Internal Ombudsman”, GO!!!But wait! We’re not done yet.According to her own LinkedIn account , Kristine Joy Patag graduated with a BA Communication Arts degree from the University of the Philippines in 2010. Straight out of college, she joined the Office of the President of the Philippines as a Presidential Staff Officer II.She was promoted to Presidential Staff Officer III in May 2014, and left the Office of the President when her principal, President Benigno “PNoy” Aquino III stepped down in June 2016.As a presidential staff officer, she said her tasks include:That is, for the first six years of her work life and using the standards of today’s political oppositon, Patag was officially a government propagandist, similar to the Mikael de Lara Co, whom I wrote about in April 2016 when he lamely defended the Aquino Government for the Kidapawan Carnage [ TP: BigasHindiBala ], or when the Aquino government shot starving farmers in Mindanao.But I digress.Going back to topic, where did Patag go right after she left Malacañang?After leaving the Palace in June 2016, Patag joined Businessworld in August 2016.Businessworld is a sister publication of Pilipino Star Ngayon and the Philippine Star.With that said, here’s a question:Judging from her resume, Patag’s career is so far defined by her lengthy stint at the Office of PNoy, so just how much influence does her former Liberal Party allies exert on her today? More importantly, it is to be noted that Patag and Pedroche essentially belong to the same organization today so...How would the senior columnist Al Pedroche, who has been a part of Philstar Inc since its inception in the 1980s, react to junior reporter Kristine Patag’s seemingly willful snobbing of his article? What would I give to have a peek at the Philippine Star’s conference rooms tomorrow! [DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!

    "body": "We usually encounter beggars along the streets, especially when we’re right in the Metro. A Facebook user named Glydel Mae Fernandez Olarte encountered a talented beggar when she and her companions were walking towards their destination because of the intense traffic jams.According to her, she and her friends opted to walk towards Severina. Before they arrived at the shop near Liway, they saw a certain beggar who was drawing on a karton. Olarte narrated that several bottles of soda surrounded him while there were cats tied to a post by the waiting shed.She wasn’t sure if the cats belonged to him but she was sure that she wanted to take pictures of him. According to Ms. Olarte, the talented beggar displayed an amazing talent in his drawing skills. Olarte lamented that her phone was in low battery mode that time, hence her failure to actually take the pictures on her own.Based on her status, it was her friend’s sibling who took the pictures of the talented beggar. She stated that talented people like him deserved to be recognized.As of this writing, Olarte’s post has received 651 likes and reactions, 332 shares, and around 19 comments from the online community.One netizen asked her about the exact location of the place and Olarte replied that she encountered the talented beggar on the waiting shed near Liway. She emphasized that people also knew it by the name of Armela, a junk shop.She probably referred to a landmark since the beggar was not necessarily in a junk shop. Some of them confirmed that they also encountered the particular beggar on their respective travels.Unfortunately, she was not able to ask his name. However, she is hoping that people like him would be recognized by the public since he is bestowed with an impressive talent.Read her full post below:Meanwhile, here are some comments from the netizens about it:What do you think about this, readers? Have you encountered the aforementioned talented beggar before? Do you know anyone else with such an amazing talent? Share your stories in the comments section below!",

    "body": "As a Belgian author,with little or no restrictions on my,online freedom, I cannot begin to imagine how it must feel,knowing that there is an entire world governmental diplomats forbid you to discover.Sites like Google.com,Twitter.com,Facebook.com,Bbc.c.uk,Wikileaks.org,Youtube.com, vimeo.com,Bing.com and remarkably thetibetpost.com, more about that in a sec.The following was said,during a 2 hour long interview by an expert in Chinese,censorship who has been locked up in china on his holiday for telling,people the truth and questioning the authorities. He wishes to remain anonymous as these impressions and statements,could be harmful when traced back to him. This is the essence and I did paraphrase,his words so some of it may seem out of context.“The good people of China are,among the most indoctrinated I’ve ever seen, nothing about the way they defend their government seems somewhat,genuine. It looks like they are wired to have a sense of hatred toward the Tibetan people. They are continuously,lied to by the government at every opportunity they get and they are censored,themselves on Sina Weibo, the government-controlled social network. I got arrested when,interviewing a local police officer who felt my behaviour was unethical and downright evil. When in custody , I had the chance to talk to inmates,who had been through roughly the same thing. In our cell block, there,were no murderers to be found, no rapists nor psychopaths. We were all just asking the wrong,questions at the wrong time and place. The stories I heard were those of Tibetans,getting captured for vague reasons and released after two months and all of these prisoners were found dead 1 year later and no one could,link those deaths to the Chinese anymore due to the leap in time. I was struck with fear and,hatred toward the Chinese people who just keep on living their lives and who don’t question,the authorities. This censorship is of course a violation of the human rights and organisations,such as amnesty are trying their best to fight this. It almost seems ridiculous how openly they abuse,freedom rights for example Liu Xiaobo Who won the nobel prize for peace (because of his work on fighting,the government) whilst in captivity, oh the irony .”GreatFire is a secretive organisation,that monitors the censored,messages on Sina Weibo and posts them on freeweibo.com for the world to see. The activists,think that the way they made the app renders it impossible to be blocked by the,government. They hope that will show others an effective way to avoid Chinese internet,restrictions, whilst furthering their goal of ending online censorship in China. GreatFire was founded in 2011 by three guys who wish to remain,anonymous in fear of China’s revenge. So how did they bypass the internet,restrictions? They hosted FreeWeibo on amazon’s cloud hosting service, It cannot be blocked,because of the businesses that rely on amazon . If blocked , too many businesses,would suffer from economic losses and the Chinese government can’t have that. This gives Greatfire an epic advantage,almost like a bank heist with an enormous amount of hostages being held. The mobile app was,taken down from the app store in reply .GreatFire hopes that the android,version cannot be taken down (as easily) and furthermore that amazon doesn’t make any deals with China (so far they have,kept quiet and respected their customer’s privacy when,asked about FreeWeibo). Their plans for the future include mirroring Free news sites such as The New York Times. This will prove to be a far bigger,challenge because this site get updated,frequently and is quite huge as well. “Our goal is to end online censorship,in China. That’s the endgame for us,” says one of the founders of GreatFire. “And we won’t rest until we have achieved,that goal.”sources:http://mashable.com/2014/04/28/freeweibo-android-app-great-firewall-china/https://en.greatfire.org/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China",

Para ito sa aking pamilya—sa aking ama at ina, na pinalaki kaming magkakapatid nang marangal. Para ito sa aking mga anak at mga apo, at sa kanilang magiging pamilya,” she said.“Inosente po ako. Malinis ang aking konsensya. Hindi ko po pinangarap na maging abogado at maging lingkod-bayan para sirain lang ang aming pangalan,” she added.De Lima thanked her family, supporters, and God for continuously giving her strength despite the challenges she is facing.“Nakakulong man ako ngayon at pinapasan ang napakabigat na pagsubok sa aking buhay, nagpapasalamat pa rin ako nang lubos sa Mahal na Panginoon sa lakas na patuloy Niyang ipinagkakaloob.”“Buong-puso akong nagpapasalamat sa suporta ng aking pamilya, at sa inyo pong lahat na nagtitiwala at kasama kong nakikipaglaban,” she added.The detained senator likewise wished that the truth may soon prevail.“Patuloy ko pong dalangin ang ating tagumpay: Ang mangibabaw ang katotohanan, ang makamtan ang katarungan ng mga pamilyang pinagkaitan ng hustisya, at ang pananaig ng demokrasya.”De Lima is also facing a disobedience to summons case before the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court Branch 24, for allegedly advising her former driver Ronnie Dayan to skip the House inquiry on the alleged proliferation of illegal drugs at the national penitentiary. —Erwin Sanchez Colcol/LBG, GMA News",

Today, another escalator accident has once again gone viral on social media.A concerned citizen named John Christopher Ladaran Seroy took to social media to share an escalator accident involving a child. To advise other parents on ensuring their children’s safety at all times, Seroy posted a video and photos of a kid who got stuck in an escalator in a mall somewhere in Davao City.“Sa mga parents, tita, tito, ate at kuya make sure na bantayan nyo mga anak ninyo. Especially if gagamit ng escalator or elevator isang mall ito sa davao, Para ma iwasan to. Wawa nman baby girl.”During the short video, a toddler can be seen trapped in an escalator while a female guardian–most people assumed to be his mother–was crouching to support the child.From their position, it appears that the toddler and her guardian was already alighting the escalator when the kid got trapped in the bottom flight. Many people’s heart broke after hearing the child’s wails, which also alerted some passersby on the mall. Fortunately, after a while, the child was able to break free from the escalator with the help of other rescuers.As of writing this, the post has already gone viral online. In just 20 hours of posting since December 20, the video already reached a staggering amount of 1.4 million views and counting. This video seemed to spark an intense debate about child safety in public places.Watch the entire clip below:Posted by John Cristopher Ladaran Seroy on Wednesday, December 20, 2017Hopefully, this escalator accident can send a lesson to every parent out there.

The combined area for a DSA and its buffer zone should not be larger than 20 percent of the total floor area of the building or conveyance.The DSA is also barred from being located within 10 meters from entrances, exits, or any place where people pass or congregate, or in front of air intake ducts. There shall be no more than one DSA in a building, and the chosen area should bear proper signage.Minors are prohibited from DSAs, the order said.The EO, however, bars the establishment of DSAs in schools, hospitals, clinics, food preparation areas, and locations in which fire hazards are present.OTHER PROHIBITED ACTSThe EO also prohibits “persons-in-charge” to allow, abet or tolerate smoking in public places.Persons-in-charge refers to a president or manager in case of a company, corporation, partnership or association, or the administrator in case of government or private property, facility, office or building, and the city/municipal schools superintendent, school president, dean or principal in case of schools.Selling, distributing, or purchasing tobacco products to and from minors are also prohibited.

    "body": "/ / in Former GMA News anchor Jay Sonza questions GMA reports on Duterte: Di’ba sabi nila ‘balitang walang pinoprotektahan’? Bakit ganito?, local news /Mr. Jay Sonza and GMA News logo| Photos from Facebook and GoogleMr. Jay Sonza| Photos from FacebookVeteran news authority Jay Sonza seem to question the credibility of his previous network’s—GMA News—way of reporting that casts doubts upon him based on a Facebook post he released, Thursday afternoon.According to the veteran journalist, he can’t understand whatever is happening inside the famous television network’s news and public affairs department.“Hindi ko parin lubos maunawaan kung ano ang nangyayari sa loob ng news and public affairs department ng pamosong television network”, he said.Comparing today’s reporting from his stint on the said network, he shared that every time there were big and significant news, his former network leads the coverage.“Dati rati kasi, tuwing may malalaki at mahahalagang balita ay bumabandera ang nasabing himpilan”, he wrote.However, he said, these past few days, the said network’s grit seemed to die out.“Subalit nitong mga huling araw ay nawala ang tikas ng nasabing himpilan”, he continued.He added that it is noticeably obvious that it averts the controversies happening which involves affiliates of the political opposition no matter how ‘earthshaking’ the development on the issues against them is.“Kapunapuna kasi na iniiwasan nito ang mga pangyayari na nagsasangkot sa mga kontrobersya ng mga kaanib ng political opposition, kahit pa earthshaking ang mga development laban sa mga ito”.Sonza also said that another noticeable thing (about GMA News) is how hesitant the news channel is in covering the news that has to do with the current administration which was not like that in the recent years.“Isa rin sa kapansinpansin ay ang pagiging bantulot ng himpilan na isahimpapawid ang mga balitang may kinalaman sa kasalukuyang administrasyon. hindi naman ganito ang balitaan noong mga nagdaan panahon”, said the news authority.“Hindi nga ba sinasabi nilang hindi natutulog ang balita at balitang walang pinoprotektahan. bakit kaya ganito? mahuhusay naman ang namumuno sa news department. sina marissa flores, senior vice president at Jessica Soho, vice president for news & current affairs ay pawang produkto ng UP Diliman”, the veteran journalist added.Trying to give the GMA News the benefit of the doubt, he then laid down his 7 theories as to why his previous network convey news these days that way:1. May kinalaman kaya dito ang pagsuporta ng pamilya marcos sa kandidatura ni Rody Duterte? Eh, ano naman ngayon kung tinulungan ni governor imee marcos si duterte?2. May kinalaman kaya ito sa pagiging chief of staff ng anak ni Atty. Felipe Gozon, chairman and chief executive officer ng gma, network sa dating Interior secretary at vice presidential candidate ng liberal party?3. May kinalaman kaya dito ang nababanaag na posibleng pag-upo ni Bongbong Marcos bilang bise presidente ng bansa matapos ang reklamo nito sa presidential electoral tribunal?4. May kinalaman kaya ito sa balitang binabawi na ni imee marcos ang 33.33% na pinangalan sa pamilya duavit at sinasabing si marcos ang tunay na pagmamay-ari ng ikatlong bahagi ng nasabing network?5. May kinalaman kaya ito sa napapabalitang hawak ng isang anak ni Gozon ang public relations campaign ng isang liberal party leader to do a vilification campaign against duterte?6. Ano ba ang ginawa ng pangulo para hayagang kontrahin siya ng gma network? na lahat ng balitang may kinalaman sa administrasyon ay halos ibasura ng network at puro tungkol sa mga batikos laban sa administrasyon ang laman ng kanilang newscast?7. Dahil ba sa No. 1 ang gma network sa rating ay kaya na nilang banggain ang malacanang? Na lumaki na ang ulo ng mga may-ari at nagpapatakbo nito?Source: Jay Sonza's Facebook page",

On June 29, Thursday, the Chinese foreign minister promised something to the Filipino people.Wang Yi said:“I want to tell the people of the Philippines that whenever difficulties and challenges, China will always stand by your side.”According to People’s Television, Wang Yi released the statement in a joint press conference following his meeting with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarters in Pasay City.Cayetano, meanwhile, said that he deeply appreciated China’s support and thanked them “for the kind of words and assurance that China will always be there for the Philippines in times of need.”On June 27, Tuesday, China donated ₱15 million to those affected by the casualties in Marawi City.The source said that Wang Yi indicated it was just the first in a series of emergency assistance to ensure that they keep their vow to help the Philippines in reconstructing the terrorist-razed city of Marawi and the surrounding area. Wang Yi said:“Fight against terrorism is a shared responsibility of all countries. China has participated actively in combating terrorism. The Philippines as close neighbor is facing severe challenges caused by terrorism and of course China will not hesitate in extending its helping hands to close neighbor.”The Foreign Minister also believes that the Philippines will overcome all difficulties and challenges – particularly attacks of terrorism -under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. Wang Yi said:“China and the Philippines have been always close neighbors, helping each other in times of needs and we are good friends and partners.”In the joint press conference, Cayetano also relayed President Duterte’s gratitude for the warm reception the President received when he visited China. Duterte went to Beijing on October 2016 and May 2017.Wang Yi also said that China will continue to have friendly and bilateral dialogues with the country about the maritime dispute in the South China Sea. He said:“We agreed to continue to dialogue to further enhance cooperation and settle differences by jointly upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea.”",

He said even other members of the PSG were unaware of the shooting until Gonzaga's wife found the body.The wife reportedly said she and Gonzaga were not facing any problems apart from the latter’s heavy workload, Dagoy told reporters.Gonzaga was in charge of the security force's operations and was not one of the president's personal guards, he added.The PSG said it \"does not want to speculate\" on the cause of Gonzaga's death.It said it \"will wait for the official findings\" of the Scene of the Crime Operatives, as it respects the privacy of Gonzaga's family.In a press briefing earlier on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella also said the circumstances of the incident have yet to be determined.\"Of course it's a matter of concern. However, we need to clarify exactly what it was all about. We don't know the exact nature of the incident so we need to be able to find out exactly what it was,\" said Abella.He also said he has no information on where President Rodrigo Duterte was when the incident happened. – with a report from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com",

    "body": "Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)Chairman Manuel Pangilingan told the government not to meddle on its operation on a crowd of stockholders and provincial journalist last Tuesday.In his statement at the PLDT annual stockholders meeting, Pangilinan expresses his dismay over the government’s latest action to review the PLDT-Globe acquisition of the 700MHz frequency with the San Miguel Corporation.The government lack of understanding on the implementation of primary infrastructure needed to transform PLDT and Smart’s services into digital could constrain its project expected operations by 2018, he said.MVP says, “The government’s share is to get out of the way,”.“Whose money is being spent? It’s the private sector’s. There is no guarantee from the government, no government fund is involved, so get out of the way, period,” Pangilinan said.PLDT and Globe go into a joint venture to buy SMC’s 700 MHz spectrum antenna for P60.1-BThe new antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) pronounced on Friday that it would not approve the PLDT-Globe deal with SMC after a thorough review.According to PLDT, the transaction with Vega Telecom Inc, the Telco business of San Miguel Corp. (SMC) was sealed on May 30, four days before the publication of the competition law’s implementation rules.PLDT and Globe said in a separate statements that they filed the required transaction notices under the PCC guidelines so the regulator could no longer challenge the deal.PCC on its statements says, “The review is intended to ensure that the transaction will, in the end, result in sustained gains for the public by not restricting competition,”Pangilinan was in defense mode stressing that the government didn’t help in its investment and that if their projects fail, it won’t help them.The 700Mhz Frequency ExplainedThe Philippines is one of the countries in Asia with the slowest internet speed ranking at 3rd place last year.The major companies implementing the fourth generation of mobile communication standards (4G) are operating in frequency bands of 850, 1800, 2100.Philippines frequencies are lacking the 700Mhz spectrum, which is important as it is operating at a lower wavelength able to penetrate on most household materials.Consider that when your neighbor plays loud music using his bass speakers, what you hear thumping through your walls are those from the 700Mhz frequencies.To make it simple, the 700Mhz band is able to penetrate to areas where 4G at higher frequencies cannot pass through, hence if you are in the building or within a walled environment (indoor), the 850/1800/2100 cannot easily give you data connections so you’ll end up with 3G or No Connectivity at all.Far unreachable areas beyond 850MHz coverage can now be able to communicate via 4G using the 700Mhz frequency.With PLDT and Globe having the 700Mhz antennas’ it won’t be sooner that a huge improvement in the mobile data experience would be felt.However, analyst says the acquisition of the antennas wouldn’t lower the cost of the monthly payment plans for internet users. Experts believe that both PLDT and Globe would still have to recover the total cost of investment and that it would take years before a cheaper price could be seen.Source:amaysim.com.au, inquirer, gsm arenaCommentscomments",

    "body": "Next November, David St-Jacques will have a whole new perspective on the world — he will be floating 400 kilometres above Earth aboard the International Space Station.St-Jacques is a Canada’s next astronaut, a family doctor raised in Saint-Lambert, Que., who will be performing many experiments on board the floating laboratory.He’s pretty well qualified for the role. In addition to his medical degree from the Université Laval in Quebec City, St-Jacques has degrees in engineering and astrophysics. He also holds a commercial pilot’s license.We asked the father of three a few questions about what it’s like knowing he will be one of the few humans to leave Earth, and what it’s like following in the footsteps of the enormously popular Chris Hadfield.The interview has been edited for brevity.Are you excited knowing you’re Canada’s next astronaut?I’m focussed more than excited. I’ll be excited in a year. I was excited a year ago for a few minutes and then I realized the magnitude of the task ahead and the magnitude of the personal challenge … because it takes a long time to become an astronaut and you’re stepping into some big shoes. There were giants there before me, so that was all very sobering and humbling. And then I got down to work.‘It’s perfect. It’s breathing. It’s fragile. It’s our only home in the cosmos, and we are responsible for it.’ – David St-JacquesI’m about a year into training already, with about a year to go. I’m like a mountain climber halfway up Everest: Far from base camp, far from the summit, and I have to stay focussed.What are you looking forward to?This is a huge opportunity, a huge privilege to do this on behalf of all Canadians. To leave planet Earth to go live on our spaceship, humanity’s spaceship, our outpost in the cosmos, is just a great dream that — touch wood — will come true one day if all goes well.What I’m really looking forward to might sound paradoxical, it’s when I’m finally in orbit and I can turn around and look back at Earth.Spending all that time and energy and effort to leave Earth, but the first thing we want to do, of course, is look back at our home and finally get a real gut feeling for what it is … This is reality. This beautiful ball floating on the black velvet background of space. It’s perfect. It’s breathing. It’s fragile. It’s our only home in the cosmos, and we are responsible for it.What has been the hardest thing so far?It’s a juggling act. If you want to stay at your best, you’ve got to stay in balance … It’s not only the job: it’s the family, it’s the friends, it’s my parents. I have to make sure I remain in balance, I remain who I am. And that’s the only way I can be my best as an astronaut.The 2009 astronaut candidates aboard a parabolic plane that simulates weightlessness and is affectionately referred to as the ‘Vomit Comet.’ (NASA)It’s a life of constant international travel; I’m constantly jet-lagged; I’m constantly under examination; I’m constantly learning new stuff.What’s it been like on your family?My family lives in Houston. That’s where the kids were born. That’s where I spend a little bit less than half my time. The rest of the time I’m in Moscow learning how to fly the Soyuz rocket; I’m in Japan learning about the Japanese segment of he space station; I’m in Europe learning about the European segment of the space station; and in Canada, learning robotics and various science experiments we’re going to be doing.My family comes to visit me. But my wife and I have a good routine. It’s a bit of a challenge, but every challenge has its opportunity, and it’s making us better people, I think.One of the big challenges in training for this mission is that my wife has her own career to pursue, but now with the added responsibility of me being absent most of the time. When I return it’s often more upsetting, it seems, to the household balance. But this is an effect some of my military colleagues told me to expect, and other astronauts.David Saint-Jacques in the Soyuz simulator during a training session in Star City, Russia. (Canadian Space Agency)There are other things. I’m looking forward to the teamwork experience. It is a great expedition … This is the ultimate trek. This is the ultimate adventure with amazing people I’m training with.And then there’s all the experiments we’ll be doing … that I can tell will have great benefits for everybody back on Earth.Is it hard to follow Chris Hadfield?His outreach legacy is enormous. What he managed to do is welcome everybody on board. He managed to make it accessible. He was one of the first to take the risk of being himself, and shedding the superhero persona. That is very inspirational to me. We all have our personalities and that’s one of the lessons I learned from Chris: It’s okay to be yourself. We all enjoy our missions and all derive personal, thoughtful, philosophical benefit from it, in different ways, and we owe it to the world. We can’t hoard that experience. You’ve got to share it.Do we take space for granted?Knowledge about the Earth comes from space. That’s how we manage our agriculture, our defence. Its how we manage emergencies; it’s how we use our map, how we navigate, how we know the weather. It’s all coming from space, but we don’t realize it. I remember once I was filling up my car at the gas station and I wanted to pay at the pump. It wouldn’t take my card. It wouldn’t work. So I had to go pay cash inside. Then I heard on the news that because of a software glitch on a satellite, the entire Interac was down for an hour.The space station is an international effort. Seen here, from left to right is Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov, Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. Behind them are NASA astronauts Tom Marshburn, Chris Cassidy and cosmonaut Roman Romanenko. (NASA)We’re a victim of our success, and the space station is part of that. The space station is unbelievable. It’s like science fiction. It’s the most complex thing that humans have ever built. That in and of itself is a miracle. But it’s a miracle of collaboration. It was built by 16 nations. The four biggest countries are the U.S., Russia, Japan and Germany. If you know anything about 20th century history, it’s amazing that these four countries are collaborating completely openly on this beautiful common project.There have been people living off the planet for over 15 years. We already have a colony outside Earth. We are learning a lot about ourselves, about our planet. And we’re learning about how to live in space for longer durations in this pursuit of this crazy dream of flying to Mars.Canadarm2 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) grasps as the HTV-3 Exposed Pallet is moved for installation on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV-3). There are two Canadian robotic arms on the ISS, Candarm2 and Dextre. (NASA)Canadians have so many reasons to be proud of our contributions to our space program. We are part of that club of nations that are pushing the boundaries of humanity.Metaphorically, we used to live in caves … Then someone thought, hey, let’s go see what’s outside. Then we wanted to have a look up on mountains and at the other valley on the other side and across forests. We just want to have a look at the beach. Have a look at the ocean. Have a look up in the air …. And now that’s where we are. Let’s just go have a look at space. Not only is it part of the human soul, it’s what makes us grow as a species.",

Ito ay pagpapatunay lamang na seryoso po ang ating layunin at ng QC government na suportahan ang advocacy ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na labanan ang problema sa illegal drugs”, pahayag ni Belmonte.Sinasabing hindi lamang tungkol sa illegal drugs campaign ang adhikain ng mga suggestion box kundi magiging daan din ito para marinig ang boses ng bayan sa usapin ng corruption, kriminalidad at violent extremism upang maaksiyunan ng mga kinauukulang tanggapan ng pamahalaan.Sinabi ni Belmonte na kapag tungkol sa illegal drugs at kriminalidad ang reklamo ay agad na ipararating sa tanggapan ni QC Police Chief Guillermo Eleazar para aksiyonan, kung sa corruption ay sa QC government at kinauukulang ahensiya at magkatulong namang aaksiyunan ng local na pamahalaan at QC Police ang problema sa usapin ng violent extremism.Read it here:https://www.facebook.com/PTVph/posts/1928426747217986Commentscomments",

    "body": "Agriculture Secretary Manny Pinol has advised President Rodrigo Duterte not to support the proposal of Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco and National Food Authority Administrator Jason Aquino to import rice.Recently, President Duterte fired Malacanang Undersecretary Maia Chiara Halmen Valdez,a protege of Evasco, last week for railroading the private importation of rice and ouster of Aquinofrom the NFA.Pinol said he was opposed to Evasco’s proposal for farmers to import rice “ because most of the private sector importers are also traders who play with the rice market once they have the imported stocks.”“For the first time in the history of the country, the national average yield per hectare is now at 4.15 metric tons per harvest, up from 3.9-metric tons. The First Quarter harvest is also 210,000-metric tons more than the same period last year. It is the position of the Department and mine as well that any importation at this time will result in the collapse of the buying price of paddy rice to the disadvantage of the farmers. In fact, I publicly proposed that NFA instead buy the produce of the farmers this season if its intention is to stock up buffer rice stocks,” said Pinol.“The differences that I have with Sec. Evasco and Adm. Aquino on the issue of importing rice by the private sector or the NFA do not mean that I have a quarrel with them,” said Pinol.Source: PolitikoCommentscomments",

    "body": "Jim Paredes, a vocal critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, is recorded to have said back in 2006, 20 years after the EDSA People Power movement, that he wanted a “strong leader” who “bends rules a little bit” and a kind of government that can “knock down some people” after his dismay at the Cory Aquino government that he described as “masyadong nagpapogi, masyadong nagpa-pressure, masyadong, ah…it was too accommodating.”The Duterte administration is plagued with allegations of extrajudicial and vigilante killings attributed to its aggressive anti-drug war campaign which is pivotal to protests of anti-Dutertes. Although himself anti-Duterte, Paredes said back then that “there is injustice if you don’t do justice anyway. There is injustice in not catching crooks. So, err on the side of zealousness. I would have gone that way, anyway,” and when he was asked if that means lining up the crooks against a wall and shooting them, he replies, “Oh, that would be nice, too. You know what? I wouldn’t cry over it if it happened.”His dismay at the Aquino government stemmed from the fact that it squandered the leadership that the Filipinos gave to them after EDSA. The reforms and changes that the people wanted actualized were held at bay and corruption, debts, and various coup attempts emerged.“I don’t think they were as bold as the people wanted them to be…masyadong nagpapogi, masyadong nagpa-pressure,” Paredes said “they should have run to the people. But [they didn’t because] what happens is that when you sit in government, the people don’t count anymore. It’s the other forces that count — the armed forces, the politicians, the moneyed, business. The people don’t count. They should have run to the people and the people would have protected them.”It is clear that Paredes wanted a revolution for the Philippines back in his 2006 interview. When asked about his opinion on the possible repercussions that a strong government would have on the people’s freedoms, Paredes boldly commented that “there is no such thing as absolute artistic freedom, any freedom. Freedom is relative. I would be willing to be more responsible about it…but I will not give it up. If it is the government’s duty to curb (artistic freedom), then let them curb it but I will not give it up.”Paredes felt in the era of a post-Marcos regime that the only way for liberal democracy to work is “with a strong leader” reasoning that “kung malakas-lakas yung leader mo, who can sort of – I mean, to pardon the expression – can sort of kick ass, no, matatakot ka to tangle with a strong President eh, kahit Senate President ka pa.”He even said that if a strong leader who embodies those qualities would emerge, he “would be willing to give that leader a chance”, however all his conclusive statements about a revolution in 2006 wavers in the face of issues bombarding him now.He lambasted Pro-Duterte supporters and decries the President for the so-called authoritarian rule despite being ready to support this style of government more than a decade ago.As Correctphilippines.org said about Paredes’ change of heart, something went wrong with him along the way and somehow the Yellows got him.",

Lagman’s ‘dishonesty’: Relax lang brod baka mabigyan mo upper cut 'yong matandang hukluban, local news /Department of Agriculture Secretary Manny Pinñol and Albay Rep. Lagman | Photo from GoogleThe statement of the Albay Representative Edcel Lagman, long-time apologist of the Liberal Party, that infuriated the Dept. of Agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol was 'Walang ginawang mabuti si Pangulong Duterte para sa mga mahihirap sa nagdaang isang taon', Mr. Sonza wrote.The GMA Network's former program host Jay Sonza shared this story in a Facebook post entitled 'KASINUNGALINGAN NI LAGMAN'.'Ayon kay sa kalihim, nuknukan ng sinungaling si Lagman dahil ang mambababatas mismo humingi ng tulong kay Duterte sa pamamagitan ng DA para matulungan ang mga taga Bicol, lalo na ang mga taga Albay', Mr. Sonza narrated.Based on Sir Jay Sonza's post, the president's alter ego cries foul over the representative's dishonest statement as Rep. Lagman was even there when Sec. Piñol distributed the help to the farmers and fishermen wherein he, the Albay representative, even asked for fishing boats made of fiber glass.'Naroon siya noong ipamahagi ang tulong sa mga magsasaka at mangingisda, wika pa ni Pinol. In fact humirit pa si Lagman ng mga bangkang pangisda na gawa sa fiber glass, dagdag pa ng alter ego ng pangulo', wrote Mr. Sonza.According to Sonza, the agriculture secretary said he immediately requested to deliver the boats for the fishermen, of which the Albay representative refused to accept as what he wanted was 'de motor', as requested by the opposition's Lagman.'Kaagad kong ipinadeliver ang 50 bangkang pangisda gaya ng request ng lider oposisyon. Hindi niya tinaggap dahil ang gusto daw ni Lagman ay de motor, Dahil dito pinamadali ko ang paggawa at delivery ng kahilingan ng mambabatas. bulalas pa ng kabig ni Digong', the former ABS-CBN news director narrated.'Kawawa naman iyong mga ordinaryong kawani ng Department of Agriculture and Fisheries na nagpakahirap para lamang mapagbigyan ang hiling ni lagman. Kung makapanglait siya, ganoon ganoon na lang, wika pa ni Manny Pinol', wrote Mr. Sonza.Disapppointed, Sec. Piñol said 'Nais kong intindihin si Lagman bilang isang pulitiko, dahil naging mayor, bise gobernador at gobernador din naman ako, pero hawa naman iyang ganyang magsisinungaling ka para lang makaupak sa presidente ng bansa dahil hindi mo ka partido, huling hirit pa ng kalihim'.Meanwhile, Mr. Jay Sonza commented saying 'Kung hindi ako nagkakamali Brod Manny ang tawag diyan ay \"intellectual dishonesty.\" Iyong alam mong hindi totoo pero sinasabi mo pa rin'.The veteran journalist then went on and jokingly told the DA secretary 'Relax lang brod baka mabigyan mong right cross at upper cut iyong matandang huklubang at nuknukan sa kasinungalingan'.",

Lets say Aika gets an allowance of 2,000 a month for food, etc. That’s 24,000. Let’s just say her entire stay costs her $100,000. That is about P5 million pesos. Leni only has P8M,” Chu said, noting that Harvard explained that the amount was the minimum needed.Krizette Chu then said that she wanted to know now if Aika Robredo was in fact on a scholarship where she is not required to pay a cent, and if she isn’t, she wants to know where Robredo will get the money.“That’s a valid question because she is the VP of the Philippines. And Corona died of heartbreak because of inconsistencies in his SALN. Now we need to know how someone who only has P8M can afford to send a kid to Harvard,” she said.Chu said that it is a great achievement to get into Harvard, and to be given a scholarship by the University is a “stuff of magic”.Robredo has proudly announced the success of her daughter, but has yet to disclose if she will be on a full scholarship but has said that they are trying to get one.“So, Madam Leni, is AIKA a full scholar of Harvard? If yes, great! If no, how is her education going to be funded?”Commentscomments",

People online could not help but admire this male professor for his beautiful penmanship. The professor became a viral sensation on social media because of his perfect handwriting on the board.A Facebook user named Caleb Bañares shared photos from Twitter showing a male teacher in front of a class. At first glance, it seems like it’s just a typical scenario in the classroom, but once you zoom in, you will notice something interesting in the background.The male professor’s beautiful penmanship looks like it came straight out of a printer! The fonts are well-adjusted and so even that it looks like an invisible ruler was used. Some people even joked that even perfectionists out there will not find a single fault on this professor’s handwriting.While most of us struggle with even just writing legibly on paper, this professor appeared an expert in this practice. While writing, his left hand is resting inside his pocket and seems relaxed.According to Bañares, the unidentified professor is teaching at Far Eastern University (FEU) Institute of Technology. Bañares was quoted as saying:“Geez kung ganito sulat ng prof ko di ko alam kung gaganahan pa ako mag notes kasi magmumukha lang scratch paper dahil sa sulat ko or pwedeng matutulala nalang ako sa sobrang astig ng sulat niya huhu.”If this is your professor, you would surely be inspired to go to class. This is also the same sentiment shared by more than 18,000 people who have reacted to the viral post on Facebook. Check out some of their insights below.Do you also know someone with a beautiful penmanship? What can you say about this?

    "body": "President-elect Rodrigo Duterte isn’t afraid of big business.A day after threatening to crackdown on telecommunication giants if they do not improve and bring down the cost of their internet connections, Duterte sent the same message to big energy companies.In a report by Mindanews’ Antonio Colina IV, Duterte said that he would not hesitate to open the captive markets of power firms to more competition especially from bigger foreign players.Duterte has had enough of the rotating brownouts that have plagued Davao City and the rest of Mindanao during the Aquino administration .“Sige bagsak ng husto para kayo wala ng kita,You want to put up (power plant)? Come here. We will amend the law to allow you. Babaan niyo. ” said Duterte in a press conference at the Royal Mandaya Hotel on 25 May 2016.“Kaya sabi ko you shape up. I told you before, shape up because if you don’t and hindi na kaya ng tao, kakainin sa energy – importations – papasukin ko ang lahat, pati ang Nigeria, meron kayong oil? Tapos sino pa, Mexico?” added Duterte.Duterte is proposing to amend the 1987 Constitution to shift from a unitary to federal form of government and relax foreign equity restriction in key business sectors .Duterte is unhappy that the big power companies operating in Mindanao have decided to build power plants using more expensive fuel such as coal and diesel to the detriment of the region’s residents and businesses. But Duterte is not too fond of privatization and would prefer private competition to keep market prices down.excerpt from source: politics.com.phCommentscomments",

He’s killing and killing and killing,” said Nicolas-Lewis. “I would say he is a murderer in that sense.”",

It can be useful when you’re making plans with a group, or just having a fruitful discussion in general. Its privacy will guarantee you that your confidential messages are secure. However, while it can be helpful and practical at most times, group chat can also be a platform for spreading negative stigma.Loading...Take these guys’ group chat for example. Earlier this week, a group of men were put under public scrutiny online after their group chat leaked on social media. Almost everyone on Facebook is involved in a group chat, but people found these men’s case beyond appalling. What concerned many people is the contents of their chat!The men in question–whose identities were withheld for privacy–made crude and tasteless jokes about unsuspecting women. They joked about “renting” different women and even bid the women amongst one another just for laughs. While they view it as a form of entertainment, these remarks are extremely demeaning and offensive to the women involved.What’s more shocking is that these guys apparently have girlfriends of their own! These guys definitely have some explaining to do with their significant others. Check out some of their conversation below:On the other hand, it is still not clear how this group chat was revealed and the identity of the person(s) who leaked it. Some people online speculated that it might be one of the guys’ girlfriend.What people talk about in their own group chat is personal, but one must be wary to ensure that no one else will come snooping on their private messages. While this case is a clear invasion of privacy, many netizens firmly agreed that the men involved got what they deserved.Were you also angered over these guys conversation? What are your thoughts about this? Your opinion counts, so don’t hesitate to drop by in our comments section below. To keep up with the latest happenings, feel free to follow us on Facebook.",

Sadya talagang inggitero at inggitero ang marami sa ating mga kababayan. Akalain mong ang simpleng photo shoot o picture taking na ito sa loob ng Malacanang ni Isabelle Duterte, unang apo o First Grandaughter ni Manong Digong, ginagawan ng isyu ng ilang mga gago at gaga!!! Kesyo hindi daw tama dahil isang lugar daw ito ng kapangyarihan o may nilabag daw na batas, etecetera, etcetera, etcetera. Hoy mga Ugok at ugak, walang nalabag na batas si Isabelle. At hindi rin masama ang pagpapalitrato niya sa Malacanang dahil PINAPAKITA NIYA ANG GANDA NITO ( kaya nga niya ginawang background sa pictorial di ba???). Ang masama kung binaboy at di na niya nirespeto ang lugar. Besides, First Grandaughter naman siya di ba??? So may K siya magpapicture sa opis ng Lolo niya…mga bobo at boba!!!!Yesterday, media outlets released the pre-debut photo of Isabelle Duterte taken inside Malacañang Palace.In photos posted on Instagram, Isabelle could be seen donning several different dresses including a red ball gown by Dubai-based couturier Garimon Roferos.The photos received mixed reaction from the netizens, some of them praised Isabelle for her beauty, while others questioned the legality of what the presidential grand daughter did.Some pointed out that posing in front of the Presidential seal is illegal.These are the photos of Isabelle Duterte’s photo shoot in the palace.Source:",

Then-Health Secretary Janette Garin said the wheelchairs were supposed to have already been distributed during the change of administration last year.She said she will coordinate with the current officials of the DOH to check why the wheelchairs are still stored at PhilPost. DOH Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Herminigildo Valle also said his office will look into the matter at the soonest time possible.It turns out from the investigation that the unused wheelchairs were supposed to be delivered to Masbate and Virac, Catanduanes.The wheelchairs were reported to be around 400 units.According to PhilPost, the 400 is what’s left of the 32,000 units that were delivered by the DOH through them to different parts of the country.PhilPost also said that several provincial and city health offices asked them to “hold” the delivery because there was no “space” at their offices at that time.PhilPost stressed that most of the wheelchairs are still in good condition, aside from a few that got drenched in rain due to leaks from the roof.Watch this video shared by GMA News for more details:Source : GMA News, YouTube, Kicker Daily NewsCommentscomments",

    "body": "NOTE: This article was originally published in August 2016, but I decided to re-publish it in light of recent events.Jose Luis Martin “Chito” Gascon arrived onto the national stage in 1986. Then the chairman of the University of the Philippines Student Council, he was among the first to heed the call of Cardinal Sin’s call to join the First EDSA Revolution [ PCIJ ].Gascon was the youngest member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution. Four years later, Congress named him as youth sector representative, giving him a direct hand in crafting the country’s laws [ PCIJ ].For much of the 1990s and 2000s, I didn’t see anything controversial or blatantly questionable about him. He graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Law in 1996, and received a Master’s in International Law from Cambridge University in London a year later [ LinkedIn ].Then I stumbled upon 2009.LP Director and PNoy Usec Chito Gascon“I can’t give any indication on whether he would announce his presidential bid. I only have hopes and dreams that he would do so tomorrow,” Gascon said, after being asked whether the senator will finally announce his presidential candicacy [GMA].In May 2010, authorities were poised to investigate Quezon Governor and LP Treasurer Rafael Nantes for the discovery of drug transshipments and manufacturing base on Quezon’s Icolong Island [Balita], suggesting that drug money may be have been used to fund the 2010 LP campaign. Unfortunately for Nantes and luckily (?) for LP, Nantes died in a chopper crash a week after the announcement [TVPatrol].The Nantes Issue happened during Gascon’s term as the Party’s Director-General. That is, Gascon was LP Director General from 2008-2011 and was the Political Director of its successful 2010 National Electoral Campaign [Liberal].Yes, Gascon helped run the 2010 LP campaign with an alleged druggist as its treasurer.Here is where things start to get really interesting.Mayor Duterte and de Lima’s CHRAsked recently about why Duterte was never charged, de Lima said, “We don’t have enough evidence against them. There [was] no one to execute a sworn affidavit to prove the existence of the death squad. [MT]”Candidate Duterte and Gascon’s CHRThe timing of the CHR probe reeks of the stench of politicking. But I admit that it's too early to say that at this point, so let's investigate a little bit more.Duterte never begged for mercy and he did not even block these investigation attempts, yet CHR still failed to indict Duterte. Why? CHR found no evidence linking him to these deaths. Because if there were, Roxas and de Lima would have been drooling like mad dogs.Is CHR violating Duterte’s civil and political rights by doing so? But CHR’s mandate is protect citizens’ civil and political rights, right?Oh, the irony.The 2004 Hacienda Luisita MassacreOver a year into Gascon’s CHR chairmanship, Gascon has not done anything to resolve the human rights violations in Hacienda Luisita. I was not even looking for cases filed against the Hacienda’s owners: even a reminder of an ongoing investigation will do. But no, there weren’t any.Machinations and Hacienda LuisitaDuterte formally ordered summary killings, or Duterte tolerates abuses of law enforcement officers.A few days before the 2010 Presidential elections, ABS-CBN published a list of alibis from PNoy, Roxas, and Hacienda Luisita spokesmen, suggesting that the Cojuangco Family’s wealth depends on the Noynoy presidency [ABS].One of PNoy’s alibis reads, “Kami na nga po ang naaapi d’yan (We are already the ones being oppressed there).”SC rules on Hacienda Luisita“Ecstatic cheers from weeping farmers shattered the silence on the court premises, after the tribunal allowed Hacienda Luisita farmers to keep their lands at a very low cost [Inq].”Who was that justice who sided with Cojuangcos? Maria Lourdes SerenoWho replaced Corona? Maria Lourdes SerenoQuestion: Did Chito Gascon’s CHR do anything about it?Answer: Nope. Nope. Nope.Rodrigo versus LuisitaA President Leni Robredo from the Liberal Party.DON'T FORGET TO SHARE!RELATED POSTS:This is the continuation of “ Who is CHR Chair Chito Gascon? [Part 1 of 2] ”.Jose Luis Martin “Chito” Gascon became the Liberal Party’s (LP’s) Director-General in 2009. He openly supported then-Senator Noynoy Aquino’s bid for the presidency.Aquino eventually won the presidency in 2010, but not without controversy.Gascon stepped down from LP leadership in 2011 and was appointed Undersecretary within the Office of Political Affairs (OPA) by President Aquino (PNoy) [ Star ].There isn’t much to be said about his performance in the OPA: he was one of the members of the Peace Panel [ OPAPP ] that attempted to forward the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL).Of course, we all know that the Liberal Party-dominated Congress allowed that bill to die a natural death [ Star ], as the draft bill purportedly violated the constitution [ ABS ], the same bill that was drafted with Gascon’s help.Gascon stepped down four years later to be appointed Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights in June 2015 [ Star ].In “ Who is CHR Chair Chito Gascon? [Part 1 of 2] ”, I explained that while de Lima reasonably succeeded to prove that extrajudicial killings exist, she failed to prove the crucial element of extrajudicial killings being systematically sanctioned by the national government.Why is this element crucial? Because it is the reason behind this whole media circus to begin with.Did any of the witnesses say Duterte himself ordered it? No. Did any of the testimonies or evidences show Duterte himself tolerated extrajudicial killings? No. But then, the failure to link these extrajudicial killings to Duterte is nothing new., then CHR Chair Leila de Lima launched an inquiry into the existence of the Davao Death Squad, with Duterte as her prime suspect [ Preda Mindanews ]. By September 2009, de Lima still wasn’t able to find conclusive evidence proving the existence of the vigilante group Davao Death Squad (DDS), let alone Duterte’s complicity, and the probe eventually died a natural death [ Inq ]., CHR chairperson Loretta Rosales said the commission wants the Ombudsman to investigate Duterte, based on the results of the previous probe that the commission conducted on the alleged presence and operations of the DDS [ TV5 ], still no conclusive evidence., no DDS-related cases were ever filed against Duterte. An exasperated Duterte said, “If she (de Lima) files a case, I’ll waive the preliminary investigation, but she has to execute an affidavit because I’m going to question her,” he said [ Inq ].Yes, six years of investigations and nonstop allegations and not a single case was filed for lack of probable cause., LP said it hopes to Duterte will back Mar after Duterte shelved his own presidential bid [ GMA ], with Roxas “casually visiting” Duterte twice in a span of two weeks [ Inq ], and we all know how that ended up., Duterte declined all VP offers and declared his candidacy via a technicality [ ABS ]., five days after Duterte filed his candidacy, the CHR announced that it will, for the third time, probe Duterte’s alleged rights abuses [ GMA ], with Gascon on the lead [ CNN ]., Aquino and LP-led Malacañang publicly backed CHR’s probe [ Star ]., rumors surfaced that the CHR was readying charges against Duterte for his alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings in Davao City [ Star ]. CHR did not press charges, essentially showing that the new round of investigations failed to yield significant results., the best CHR can say is they’ll be watching. Gascon said, “As all public officials will take oath to uphold the Constitution, we will hold that President-elect Duterte will stand for human rights [ Inq ].”Seven fruitless years since the 2009 investigation and CHR found nothing significant enough to build a case against Duterte, yet the CHR and de Lima continue to hound Duterte with allegations.three months have passed since then, and we are faced with yet another investigation.Judging from Gascon’s insistence on the International Criminal Court angle [ Star ] despite the lack of evidence, the CHR has pretty much pre-judged Duterte.With these said, it is clear that the CHR, for seven years, has focused its resources on a crusade against Duterte, despite the chronic lack of evidence which, by the way, is the exact same thing that the CHR is required to produce. Should the CHR focus on allegations that actually have evidence to back them up? What’s confusing for me is CHR’s silence on another, more gruesome, extrajudicial killing case that, unlike the Duterte issue, provides a wealth of evidence.I am referring to the worst post-Martial Law government-sanctioned human rights violation: The Hacienda Luisita MassacreI am notorious for writing extremely long articles. Hence, to reduce the word count, here's a video clip taken during the 2004 Hacienda Luisita Massacre [ TP: Hacienda Luisita ]:Police and army units killed at least seven protesting farmers [ MS ] and injured hundreds [ Int’list ]. More deaths followed in the succeeding years [ GMA ].A decade later in 2014 and before Gascon became CHR head, CHR Commissioner Atty. Norberto dela Cruz and Region III Director Atty. Jasmin Navarro Regino confirmed various reports of grave rights violations in Hacienda Luisita during its field investigation held on April 29, 2014 [ LuisitaWatch ].Despite these findings, nobody has been arrested as of April 2016 [ DavaoToday ].I googled for news articles between 01 June 2015 to 26 August 2016 using the keyword “Gascon Luisita” [ Google ]. Google returned eight news articles, and none of them directly concerning Hacienda Luisita.No pronouncements from Gascon, despite the CHR’s 2014 confirmation that grave rights violations were committed.The massacre is just a small part of the decades-long struggle of Luisita farmers for their rights over Luisita land per the Comprehensive Land Reform Program in 1988 [ L.A.Indymedia ].Using legal sorcery, the Cojuangcos held on to the land up to this day.Now, let’s recall that anger over the extrajudicial killings arises from the notion that summary killing has become the President’s policy. To prove this, at least one of the following conditions must hold [ TP: Gascon P1 ]:Now, sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose, so let's apply the same standards on PNoy vis-a-vis the Hacienda Luisita issue.On the Hacienda Luisita issue, the second condition holds.PNoy stance on the Luisita issue was clear as he and his ally, losing 2016 LP presidential bet Mar Roxas, defended the injustices against the Luisita farmers.Despite PNoy’s stance, the Supreme Court sided with the farmers.On 25 April 2012, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to ordered the distribution of almost 5,000 hectares land to farmers and fixing the valuation for just compensation to the 1989 value of the land, making the land more affordable for the poor farmers [ Inq ]. Cabreza even wrote,While the decision was unanimous, one Supreme Court justice agreed with Hacienda Luisita Incorporated’s appeal that the 2006 valuation be used instead. That justice’s opinion, of course, was not adopted [ Inq ]. Inq ].A month later, Chief Justice Renato Corona was impeached [ Inq ], with PNoy’s Malacañang allegedly bribing senators P50 million each to vote against him [ GMA ]. ABS ].The Supreme Court’s decision was final and executory, and it was up to Aquino’s Department of Agrarian Reform to implement the court order.Through corporate-legal mumbo-jumbo, reclaimed ownership of the 6,453-hectare Hacienda Luisita, reducing the farmer-beneficiaries who were supposed to own the land under the agrarian reform program to sakadas or plantation workers [ MS ], instead of making them bonafide landowners under the Agrarian Reform Program.As of yesterday, or almost 30 years after CARP’s launch and four years after the 2012 SC decision, the farmers still do not own the lands they till [ Inq ].On the Luisita Issue, the Aquino Administration clearly tolerated Hacienda Luisita Incorporated’s excesses to the detriment of poor Tarlaceño farmers. A countless number of articles, investigations, testimonials, admissions and other pieces of evidence say so.Despite the preponderance of evidence, however, Gascon’s CHR deems the Luisita issue a non-priority.On the Duterte Issue, the sequence of events in the previous sections clearly show the lack of evidence to pin down Duterte. An investigation in 2009, another in 2012, another in 2015, and another in 2016, all failed to produce sufficient evidence.Despite this, Gascon’s CHR has been going after Duterte for seven years and running.Thus, I ask, why?Being its former director general and campaign director, Gascon has extremely close ties with the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party’s head was PNoy, who also happens to be the poster boy of the Cojuangco Family, the “owners” of Hacienda Luisita.Meanwhile, Duterte has become the Liberal Party’s archnemesis since he declared his candidacy. Duterte’s trademark in the past couple of months is his war on drugs. Unfortunately for LP, this will hurt, as many of its members and its appointees have been implicated in the drug trade [ TP: Ronnie TP: Mayors ].Interestingly, the Duterte Administration made peasant rights activist Rafael Mariano DAR Secretary. His first order as DAR Sec? Distribution of Hacienda Luisita land [ Star/Yahoo ].Now, what would happen if Gascon somehow succeeds to remove Duterte from Malacañang?The answer is simple:Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!",

They have chosen a very strong ruler.”He also mentioned that the United States had a war on drugs but it was immediately eradicated by politicians and now the drug situations is worse.In dealing with drugs, the US should get inspiration from the Philippines where the president viewed it as a war and not just a police action, as their situation on drug trade is getting worse.In the declaration of Duterte to separate PH from the US, Black said that US is to blame as the government should have dealt with PH in a more sensitive fashion.He said the Chinese offered assistance, while the US offered condemnation.“It would be a shame to lose our alliance with the Philippines” the senator said.Watch full video here:Video courtesy by LaRouchePAC Videos.Commentscomments",

Security and safety talaga no’ng bata iyong iniisip namin,” the Starstruck finalist emphasized.Although relatively small, the tiny family has made many meaningful memories in their three-bedroom unit in Taguig– “Do’n na ako nagbuntis, do’n na lahat. So, a lot of memories na ang nangyari sa place na ito. Kaya love na love namin ang house na ito.”She also shares that one reason that the place was special to her was because she was the chief interior decorator! Rey and Yasmien really put their styles and ideas together to make the perfect charming home for their family. “Gusto kasi namin na sa bawat sulok ng house namin, iba-iba ‘yong theme na makikita mo,” the Kapuso actress enthused.",

Studies show that the cause for majority of kids who develop irreversible back deformities can be traced back to the weight of their school bags.According to medical experts, a child may suffer from permanent back damage is he is carrying more than 15 percent of his body weight on his shoulders. Childhood is a crucial period for bone growth because a child’s skeletal is still growing; making him also susceptible to bone deformities if left neglected.Unfortunately, most kids nowadays carry overloaded backpack which are heavier than what they can actually manage. This is because most school nowadays don’t have adequate space for lockers, forcing children to carry everything with them that’s why it is not surprising that the number of schoolchildren who experience back problems are increasing. Take this case for example.Recently, a distraught netizen turned to social media to raise awareness against other people who are letting their kids carry heavy backpacks to school everyday. Facebook user Zahir Ali posted graphic images of his nephew who suffered an irreversible spine condition for regularly carrying an overloaded bag.",

Ang ama niya mismo ang user, mga uncle ang mga pusher diyan at ginagamit si Kian na courier. Kaya nag-surface ang pangalan niya sa area mismo,” Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Ronald dela Rosa said.Dela Rosa disclosed that information from intelligence community and the Caloocan City police claims that Saldy delos Santos, Kian’s father, was notorious for being the neighborhood ruffian which kept witnesses and residents from speaking up about the family.“Pati ang intelligence community natin na nagko-conduct ng operation plan sa Caloocan mismo, ang mga kapitbahay doon takot mismo na magsalita ng against sa kanila dahil kilalang siga ang ama pati mga uncle niyan, siga sa lugar. Yan ang nasasagap ng ating mga intel operatives diyan sa area,” dela Rosa said.Kian is viewed as the victim of his family’s illegal drug trade involvement, and dela Rosa acknowledges that there would have been room for change for the young man.“Biktima lang ang bata at ginagamit ng ama. Bigyan siya ng pagkakataon na magbagong-buhay at matuto na mali ang ginagawa niya. Sumusunod siya sa utos ng kanyang pusher na ama. Bata pa, magbago pa yan,” he said.The untoward circumstances that happened to Kian is currently being investigated. Dela Rosa has already issued an order to the PNP-Internal Affairs Service (PNP-IAS) lest the “isolated case” affects the whole reputation of the police force.“I want to reiterate I do not tolerate abuses from my personnel, from my men. So much so that our internal cleansing program having breakthrough, na masisira naman dito kung talagang ma-establish na may pang-aabusong ginawa ang pulis Caloocan,” he said.In the wake of these controversies, the PNP Chief ordered the relief of Caloocan City Police Chief Senior Superintendent Chito Bersaluna and three other police personnel present during the botched drug raid.While the death of Kian merited the PNP Chief’s dismay, he admits that the drug operation was legitimate due to the drug syndicates involved.“Dismayed ako sa outcome ng operation, bakit napatay ang bata, pero hindi ako dismayed sa operation itself dahil meron naman talagang basehan ang operation na itinuturo talaga si Kian ay source ng droga doon sa area,” he said.sourceCommentscomments",

Mouth stuffed with money.Rappler was also targeted by the ire of netizens for allegedly protecting the senator.One netizen said, “ladies and gentlemen, mga kababayan, this is what spinning to condition the minds of the people is all about. The entire world has seen the meltdown of the Senator yet Rappler sees it differently. This online new entity has taken the role of fault-finder in the Duterte presidency to the point of neglecting critical thinking, which is a very important aspect of Thought Leadership. I am amused.”As Rappler’s founder, Maria Ressa was bashed for her editorial choices that have led to Rappler seemingly trying to protect a staunch Duterte critic.Netizen Mike Acebedo Lopez posted Rappler’s article on Trillens’ BBC interview and wrote a caption saying, “most of us have seen the BBC interview, a grand display of feeblemindedness and a much-deserved paring down of the senate stooge, yet this is Maria’s Rappler’s takeaway.

This time, she shared details about her past relationship with none other than the Mayor of Quezon City, Herbert Bautista.In a recent interview with People Asia Magazine, the host-actress confessed that one of the lowest moments of her life was when her former flame Herbert canceled their wedding.“Herbert Bautista canceled our wedding. One of the lowest moments of my life. I still remember the date, April 8, 2014, inatrasan ako sa kasal ni Herbert. Over the phone. I was in Bellevue Hotel in Alabang because we were celebrating the (advanced) seventh birthday of Bimbi. It did not hit me at first because we were having a party.”Kris Aquino added that Herbert Bautista’s marriage proposal was issued a month before he canceled the wedding, though she opted not to divulge the reason why the QC Mayor decided not to push through with their nuptials. In January 2017, Herbert proposed to her once again with a D-color, heart-shaped diamond ring while they were in Rome. Kris recounted Herbert’s words that time:“Ang tagal kong utang ito sa ‘yo. So, puwede bang makabawi ngayon?”Kris accepted the ring, only to give it back the following day.“I returned it the next day because I said that we will always have responsibilities that came before he and I meet. And as long as our children are not done yet with their studies, I don’t think we have the freedom to be able to choose happiness. I returned the ring not because gusto kong iparamdam sa kanya kung anong pinaramdam niya sa akin three years before that. It was because nagising na ko. I just realized that a person like him and a person like me can’t be together because (my mom said this already) in a home there can only be one star. And I think, a union like that would require me to no longer be me. And I still want to be me.”She went on:“I admire him so much because he was willing to be the knight in shining armor and he came back when I was already nobody. He came back when I had no network, I had no power, we had no base. Dun ako humanga sa kanya.”When asked how long she and Herbert were together, Kris said that they never really had a relationship at all.“We don’t even have a relationship at all. I don’t count it anymore because it was always nauudlot. I told him, ‘Tayo yung perfect na what-could-have-been so let’s just leave it there.’ I really appreciated it that he came back to my life when I was a nobody.”Kris Aquino is set to grace the cover page of People Magazine Asia for their December 2017- January 2018 issue.What are your thoughts and reactions on this?

    "body": "During the recent intense altercation between senators Richard ‘Dick” Gordon and Antonio ‘Sonny” Trillanes IV, the two traded some very memorable insults that certainly brought color to the otherwise drab senate hearing despite the fact that it did interrupt the BOC probe.If you’re tired of Trillanes as well and if you agree with Minda Nation’s sentiments, you can click here and sign the petition in support of their request.Senator Gordon, for example, said of Trillanes, “The trouble with this gentleman is every time he doesn’t like it, he will conduct a coup and then he will be forgiven and he will conduct another coup and then he’s forgiven again”. To this the latter called the veteran senator pathetic for supposedly having barricaded Subic in order to hold on to his position.In the midst of this, Gordon hreatened to personally file an ethics committee case against the younger senator, to which Trillanes retorted, “Please do so. I welcome that”.Well, it seems Sen. Trillanes may finally get what he asked for. Sen. Gordon recently released a formal statement declaring his intention to personally file the aforementioned case.I am filing an ethics complaint against Sen. Trillanes for his disorderly behavior and for his improper language. I have to defend the honor and dignity, not only of the Senate, but of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee as well. The reputation and dignity of the Senate is primordial and the preservation of the Senate’s honor was what I tried to uphold by trying to rein him in and maintain an orderly proceeding. I will not countenance disorder.A senator is supposed to act in a most cordial and the most gentlemanly manner that is why we refer to one another as the Gentleman from Olongapo, Bicol, and so on and so forth. But Sen. Trillanes has been consistently displaying acts that are unbecoming of a memberof this august chamber. Whenever he fails to get what he wants, he would accuse everyone of being in a conspiracy against him. Then he would make all kinds of accusations or allegations about those who went against him to discredit them. The first time that a similar circumstance arose, I forgave him after he went to my office to apologize. But now the time for talking is over.As Chairman of the Blue Ribbon Committee, it is my duty not to allow its investigations to be turned into fishing expeditions for the pursuit of a personal agenda. My apologies for losing my temper but it was hard to maintain it given such a blatant display of intransigence.”In relation to this, the people behind the website mindanation.com had put up a petition on change.org urging Senator Gordon to push through with the ethics case against Trillanes who has previously gotten away a lot of times with mouthing off unfounded accusations based on mere hearsay and with little to no evidence at all.Below is Minda Nation’s change.org request:Antonio Trillanes’ obsession with President Rodrigo Duterte and his family needs to be stopped as it is already interfering with the vital work of the senate. The whole nation is now being held hostage by one man’s megalomaniacal delusions. Trillanes is a menace to society. How long will the senate allow him to drag the institution through the mud just to satisfy his personal vendetta.Sen. Richard Gordon has said that he will file a complaint against Trillanes before the Senate Ethics Committee and move for his expulsion.We now urge the good Senator to make good on his threat, and do the entire nation a public service by removing Trillanes from the Senate in the same manner he left the Armed Forces of the Philippines- in utter disgrace.As of this writing, Minda Nation’s petition only lacks 2,010 more supporters in order to be in effect.If you’re tired of Trillanes as well and if you agree with Minda Nation’s sentiments, you can click here and sign the petition in support of their request.Source: Mindavote, Change.org, thingkingpinoyCommentscomments",

It resulted into such a sad tragedy that will leave the family at a loss on how to deal with it.Claire said:“Michelle’s been unsafe in that property for months and months and the police was aware of this, and the social services was aware of this, the council was aware of this, and I’m sorry to say this but … they’ve let her down, and my sister and her kids would have had a chance of survival if they did their job properly.“December 11 of this year, Michelle’s home burst into flames. Her four children, Demi, Brandon, Lacie, and Lia, didn’t survive the ordeal. But what’s worse is that Michelle has no clue that she is now childless because she is in a coma. Local authorities believe that the fire was due to arson and not some faulty wiring.Mike Pearson, Michelle’s father, revealed that his daughter begged for her family to be moved into a safer house just a week before this incident happened. Unfortunately, social services didn’t listen because they thought that nothing bad would happen.Three people were charged with the murder of Michelle’s children. Mike is at a loss at how their family will survive the situation. The grieving man doesn’t know how to open this up to Michelle once she wakes up. Is there a proper way of saying to a clueless mother that her children are now gone?We pray for Michelle and her family to find peace and happiness despite trying times.Here are some netizens offering their condolences and opinions to the grieving family:Salford house fire: Grandfather of victims pays tribute Michelle Pearson's four children died in a house fire in Salford.

Acosta said that their office is not only for the accused but it is for the people who need help and it is based on who comes first. She claims it is the victim’s family who needs them and the PAO Chief also said that they want to give justice to the victims especially to the children who were minors, one of them barely one-year-old, killed by drug addicts. Atty. Acosta also said that she believes that illegal drug use is the root cause of the bad things people do.PAO Chief Atty. Presida Acosta’s statement to deny the accused of legal counsel seems to violate his rights as per the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines Article III, Section 12:“… to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.”No matter how heinous the crime a party is accused of, they are entitled to their right to counsel. Furthermore her assumption of the accused’s guilt seems to be contrary to being presumed innocent until proven guilty as per Article III Section 14 Paragraphs 1-2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines:“(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. (2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.”The victims were killed inside their home in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan last Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Estrella and Aurora were found lifeless and naked in different parts of the house. The three children were then found inside a locked room also dead from stab wounds. They were found by Carlos, Estrella’s husband who just came home from his night duty as a security guard in a bank in Makati City.One of the three suspects surrendered himself to the authorities as his conscience was haunting him and he regretted the crime that he did. The suspect said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN “Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok,” . He also said that they were under the influence of drugs that’s why they did the crime.",

However, a netizen who claimed herself as a former aide of Megastar Sharon Cuneta said that Sen. Kiko will never give way to any of his partymates, not even Sen. Bam Aquino.33“Matagal po akong naging isa sa mga alalay ni Mam, at madalas ko pong naririnig kay Sen Kiko na gusto nyang tumakbo sa pagka president. Dapat nga daw nung 2010, kaso nga mas sikat si Mar Roxas sa kanya, tas nagpaubaya naman kay PNoy.” Sharon’s ex-aide said in her message to us here at Philippine News Courier this Friday, November 24.“Wala na po ako sa kanila nung final na ang pagiging LP president ni Sen Kiko. Kaso sabi ng fren ko na naiwan kay Mam, di na daw papayag si mega senador na di tatakbo sa 2022. Di na daw sya papayag na iba ang piliin ng LP, kahit gusto ding tumakbo ni Sen Bam.” The netizen added, who requested not to be identified to protect her privacy.According to the netizen, Pangilinan want to run for president in 2010 but he was overshadowed by the popularity of Mar Roxas, who eventually gave way for Noynoy Aquino. She added that Sharon’s husband was very happy to be chosen as LP president. And in the coming 2022 election, the Mega senator will push his ambition to be next president.As of posting, neither Sen. Pangilinan nor Sen. Aquino has announced if they plan to run for president in 2022 or not. But nevertheless, Sen. Kiko has been very vocal in criticizing President Rodrigo Duterte, especially about human rights related to war against drugs. By the way, Sharon is the niece of Senate Majority Leader Tito Sotto, a Duterte ally.On the other hand, Sen Bam Aquino is the nephew of the late Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., and the cousin of former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III. The 40-year old senator has been in the headlines when President Duterte approved his bill seeking ‘Free Tuition in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs)’ last August.Contributed by Salvi Dalida",

We fought on principle and now the NSAs (national sports associations) are given the opportunity to choose,” said Vargas, president of the Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines.The Inquirer tried but failed to reach Cojuangco for comment.“This decision now opens up the democratic process. A patently wrong and discriminatory position has been corrected,” said Vargas. “The reforms have begun.”Vargas was supposed to challenge Cojuangco, the incumbent president at that time, but was disqualified by the election committee headed by former International Olympic Committee representative Frank Elizalde.The POC comelec, which also had Bro. Bernie Oca FSC and representative Conrado Estrella III as members, ruled that Vargas and Tolentino were not “active members” of the POC general assembly.Tolentino is the country’s cycling chief and president of the Integrated Cycling Federation of the Philippines.According to Elizalde, Article 7, Section 11 of the POC constitution and by-laws state that candidates for president and chairman should be an active member of the POC general assembly for two consecutive years.It said candidates should have attended at least 50 percent plus one of the total number of GAs the past two years. These GAs are held every two months.Elizalde said Vargas attended the GA only once while Tolentino thrice over the past two years prior to the election.",

It was one of the first gigantic structures build by the National Construction Corporation (PNCC), the biggest construction company in Asia, also created during Macos era.San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and stretches from Samar to Leyte across the San Juanico Strait in the Philippines.Its longest length is a steel girder viaduct built on reinforced concrete piers, and its main span is of an arch-shaped truss design. With a total length of 2.16 kilometers (1.34 mi), it is the longest bridge in the Philippines spanning a body of seawater.The bridge was slightly damaged during the Yolanda typhoon but it was immediately repaired.Roque said that Duterte is expected to sign the EO next week.Several lawmakers submitted proposal before to officially name the bridge after Marcos, but allies of previous administrations blocked those proposals from reaching the Congress.San Juanico Bridge is just one of Marcos’ infrastructure projects that Filipinos are still benefiting until today.Source- http://www.okd2.com/duterte-issue-eo-officially-renaming-san-juanico-bridge-marcos/",

Rafael Absalon of Seniors of the Future said that the bill is a blatant attack against not only our senior citizens, but all people.“Yong bill ni Senator Hontiveros ay halatang hindi pinag-isipan. Ang mga matatanda ay dapat ngang kaawann. Hindi naming maintindihan kung ano ang dahilan at ginawa ni Sen. Hontiveros ang ganyang bagay”, Absalon said.Hontiveros, in her draft explained that the plan is to save government’s money. She also cited that many senior citizens are still working between the ages of 60 to 65 years old. She noted that many senior citizens at the age of 61 to 64 are still working as taxi and jeepney drivers.“People are just getting government’s money while still working”, part of the bill said.The bill also stated that the government can use the money to educate younger people instead of giving to the “olds”.“The government should invest more on young people instead of nursing older generations. Young people should be aware about Martial Law atrocities so the mistake will not be repeated”, part of the draft said.The bill also plans to discontinue the P500 social pension every month allocated for senior citizens. /Vernalyn Bruzo [source]Commentscomments",

And then super dark. E ‘di ba ‘pag rock and roll, head bang? Hindi ko nakita na may mic pala in front of me. And ‘pag nag-head bang kasi ako, pak, ganun. Nung tumama ako, nag-blackout na ako, e,\" she told PEP.She also said, “I’m still singing ‘tapos duguan na raw ako. So they had to carry me out of stage to the hospital. They had to rush me to the hospital. Nagising ako tinatahi na yung mata ko. Sabi ko, ‘Anong ginagawa niyo? Is it bad?’ Hindi sila sumasagot, yung mga friends ko. ‘No, no.’\"“Mahirap kasi talagang grabe, para akong binugbog ni Pacquiao, yung first few days. So tinahi yung eyelid ko, talagang wide open. They don’t have to stitch the nose naman, pero talagang malala, so dinikit nila iyan.

Do you think Arci Muñoz had plastic surgery nose lift and horribly failed?Arci Muñoz is probably one of the prettiest faces on Philippine show business and is also one of the most adored by social media users. In fact, there are different fan pages dedicated to her on social networking site Facebook made and managed independently by fans.Fans were always on the look out on their newsfeed to see her new photos then one day everyone was shocked when Arci's most recent photos was posted. Netizens noticed something is off with her new look and speculated that she must have undergone a cosmetic surgery on her face.Many social media users think that she had a nose job but that it failed horribly as they think that it gave her an unnatural look.In a report by ABS-CBN News, it was said that Arci admitted 'overlapping' her lips when she applies lipstick and that she looks noticeably different without it. However, fans think that does not explain why her nose looked different in her new photos that has since gone viral since being uploaded by netizen Tricia Castro.The said photos of the young actress quickly gained traction and went viral gathering thousands of likes and shares as well as comments from social media users.",

Her name by the way is Joyce Tadeo. She joined Uber October of last year 2016.

Isabelle is the 17-year-old daughter of Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte with his ex-wife, Lovelie Sangkola Sumera. She also happens to be an aspiring actress and has actually recently signed with infamous talent manager Annabelle Rama.Isabelle Duterte seems to be an aspiring fashionista. A quick look at her Instagram feed makes it readily apparent that the presidential granddaughter is quite the dedicated follower of fashion trends. She also seems to love designer shoes and bags. In fact, of the 37 photos in her Instagram feed, three of them showcase her very expensive luxury bags. At the young age of 17, Isabelle really does seem to know her way around luxury goods.In one of her recent uploads, Isabelle posted a photo of herself taken during her trip to Syndey, Australia. A red Céline luggage tote can be seen on the bottom-left part of the photo. The bag, which is a “Nano Luggage Bag in Baby Drummed Calfskin” in red, retails for at least USD 2,700 according to the official website of Céline.That is a whopping PHP 135,445.50 just for a single handbag, going by today’s dollar-to-peso conversion. An average Filipino family of four needs only PHP 120,000.00 to live comfortably for one whole month. This begs the question: just how rich is Isabelle Duterte and, by extension, her family?Another photo from May 2016 shows the then-16-year-old Isabelle toting a black Céline handbag of the same design during a trip to Japan.A bathroom selfie taken in April, shows the presidential granddaughter sporting another Céline bag, this time a “Micro Luggage Bag in Baby Drummed Calfskin” in the color Kohl. The bag retails for at least USD 2,900, or approximately PHP 145,362.50 by today’s dollar-to-peso conversion.Céline is a French leather luxury goods brand founded by Céline Vipiana in 1945. The company was acquired by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy in 1996, and the brand has been known to serve as a status symbol ever since. Céline launched its line of luggage totes in 2010 and is available in five different sizes: Nano, Micro, Mini, Medium Phantom, and Large Phantom. Prices from this line range from USD 2,100 to USD 2,900, depending on the size and material used.It seems like the presidential granddaughter really has a taste for the finer things in life and the money to afford this kind of luxury.What do you think of Isabelle Duterte’s love for luxury handbags? Where do you think she gets the money to afford such a lavish lifestyle? Sound off in the comments section below!",

    "body": "Roque’s “Nine out of ten”Assuming the unlikely event that Roque’s “nine out of ten” statistic has factual basis, asking the public not to panic solely on the basis that 90% of the vaccine recipients are protected directly negates Roque’s supposed reputation as a human rights lawyer.Does the protecting 90% justify endangering the remaining 10%? The government “inoculated” over 700,000 individuals, so the fact that Sanofi and the government endangered over 70,000 is “no reason to panic”? Besides, how sure is Roque that 90% have had dengue before, which is a requirement for the vaccine to work as designed?Where is the study? When was it published? Where was it published? Or did the government just made that number up to justify the botched mass vaccination program?To add further insult to injury, Roque, aside from being the presidential spokesman, is also the Presidential Adviser on Human Rights.What’s more disturbing, however, is the Department of Health’s claim that Dengvaxia provides “a 30-month protection” before the risk of contracting severe dengue kicks in.Referring to those who received Dengvaxia but have never had the virus in the past, Duque said in Filipino , “Even if they received their first dose, they shouldn’t panic because the first dose of the vaccine gives protection for 30 months.”Under Duque’s “30-month protection” theory, all of the recipients under the assailed vaccination program must still be alive by today, because the program was launched only 20 months ago.Civil society group Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) claims that at least three kids have died after receiving Dengvaxia as manufacturer Sanofi maintains that there have been no deaths due to the vaccine“30-month protection” a myth?DoH Sec. Duque versus Reality“…The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true… infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)…”Please, not another Christine!I smelled fearShocked in TarlacDr. “Santos” takes no one elseShocked, confused, and slightly scaredA \"new\" Leijani “resurfaces”DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:In as early as program’s second week, however, a male recipient was pronounced dead on arrival at the Bataan General Hospital after suffering from cardiac arrest.Just two weeks after the death, authorities exculpated Dengvaxia by pinning the blame on congenital heart disease. Then-Health Secretary Janette Garin, who was the vaccine’s main government proponent and who headed its regulatory approval, ascertained the cause of death in no more than 14 days.Authorities said the child died “ due to cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema and other underlying causes such as congenital heart disease, gastroenteritis, with moderate dehydration. Now, Dengue can trigger cardiac arrest [ Vancini-Campanharo 2016 ]. It’s is linked to pulmonary edema [ Lee 2012 ]. It also has symptoms similar to gastroenteritis [ Varatharaj 2010 ], and it also causes dehydration [ US CDC ].Is former Health Sec. Garin absolutely certain that it’s not dengue, or was she, along with the rest of her department, merely trying to cover up the mess?I have reason to believe that it is so, as Garin has an extensive history of ignoring multiple World Health Organization warnings against Dengvaxia, warnings that were issue way before, right before, and immediately after the launch of her catastrophic mass immunization program.If Garin indeed attempted a coverup, does it also mean that Health Sec. Duque’s “30-month protection” theory is just a figment of his imagination?Just hours ago, News5 reported that 10-year-old Bataan 4th grader Christine Mae de Guzman, one of the vaccine’s first recipients, died from severe dengue before receiving her second dose of Dengvaxia scheduled October this year. Christine had no prior history of the disease: this was her first dengue infection.Duque’s “30-month protection” theory would have meant that Christine would still be alive by now.But according to the death certificate, Christine died from severe dengue.What happened to this Christine seems to confirm the untested risk with Dengvaxia that Sanofi itself cited in a 17 March 2016 document of the World Health Organization. Sanofi said that for those who have never had dengue:Was Duque referring to some parallel universe that the rest of the planet has yet to discover? If so, then let us hope that we can refund the P3.5 billion we paid Sanofi so we can ship the 700,000 kids to the Bermuda Triangle and hope against all hopes that they will somehow end up there.But then, I am very big believer of Hanlon’s razor, or the saying, “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”So, should we attribute the “30-month protection” theory to malice, or is it merely a product of stupidity?Yesterday, I interviewed Lejani Pangalangan, a Tarlac mother who claimed that her daughter, Aimy Junnel Tamayo, contracted dengue Aimy never had dengue prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. She received all three doses under the same mass immunization program where the late Christine got hers. Aimy’s last Dengvaxia shot was in August 2017, and the mother claims Aimy contracted dengue three months later on 28 November 2017.After the phone interview last night, the mother and I agreed to meet this afternoon. I told her that I will visit them in Tarlac so I can interview them personally. The mother was even glad that I’ll come to visit because I promised to help them with the bills after she told me that she even had to borrow money so she could bring Aimy to the hospital.The mother also said in the interview that the child was vaccinated without parental consent, although she doesn’t blame Aimy’s teachers for it because she believes that the teachers acted only upon orders from the Department of Health.I wrote a  article about that phone interview and it was published last night at 12:12 AM . The article quickly went viral and it has garnered over 16,000 shares as of this article’s writing.A few hours later at 7:12 AM, the mother Lejani tried to call me but the signal on my phone was poor. I have a morning radio program, “Karambola sa DWIZ”, so I was inside a building at time, preparing for the show. I texted Lejani, asking why she tried to call.Lejani replied in Filipino, “I just want to correct something I said. I think I was mistaken when I said there was no parental consent. I signed a waiver before the first dose. The teacher found a copy.”That was odd. Leijani said she discovered about the immunization only after Aimy’s younger sister complained about why she wasn’t given Denvaxia too. If Leijani indeed signed a consent form, how would she totally forget about it?JUST A FEW HOURS LATER AND SHE’S BACKTRACKING ALREADY!?I felt that Leijani was lying about the consent form, but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Despite my reservations, I immediately updated the article to reflect this development and I informed her about it about it right away.A few minutes later, Lejani texted, “Please, sir, I do not want to ruin their reputation! Please delete the article if you don’t mind! They love my daughter a lot!”I replied, “Yup. They’re safe. I’ll protect them.”Should there be problems, I was intent on defending Aimy’s teachers, even if it has to be in front of Education Secretary Leonor Briones: I would’ve done so even if no one asked for it. I have interviewed Sec. Briones just two weeks ago , I have her contact details, and I believe that she is a very fair and just human being who responds well to reason. Teachers are already overworked and underpaid. While they are expected to follow all the rules by the book,I am a firm believer that they deserve to be shown more compassion than most people. Despite the assurance, the mother repeatedly insisted that I take down the article, but it takes more than a couple of text messages for me to do that. Leijani sent one text after another, with each subsequent message sounding more and more panicky.Unfortunately, my radio show starts at 8 AM so I couldn’t read or respond to her messages during that time, so I texted, “I’ll speak to you later po, I’m on air right now.”(The Filipino word “Po” is a form that indicates respect or politeness .)After the radio show ended, I immediately and repeatedly tried to call her after the radio show but her phone cannot be reached. I started to worry, as there are wide range of things that could have gone wrong with the child. Leijani told me the night before Aimy’s platelet count was low at 38 and may still be falling.From my best recollection, I think I managed to call her at around 11:30 AM as I was on the way to Tarlac, I confirmed with her that we will meet between 2 and 3 PM as previously agreed upon.I texted her again at 12:50 PM, asking her if she was alright.She replied at 1:53 PM with, “I hope you can delete the article.”I arrived at the hospital at exactly 2:19 PM, in line with our agreement.Right before I entered the lobby, a hospital staffer recognized me and asked for a photo. The hospital staffer said he is one of my social media followers so he was already aware of what Leijani and I agreed upon. He told me that Aimy and Leijani have already been transferred to another hospital.I was shocked. I told him I needed more details, so he introduced me to another hospital staffer who witnessed the hospital discharge. Note that I will never reveal their identity, for their own protection.The second staffer told me the following that doctors from the Department of Health – Tarlac arrived at hospital around 9:00 AM. The doctors spoke to Leijani over breakfast at the hospital cafeteria.He said the doctors paid for all the expenses Leijani has so far incurred and told the hospital that they will facilitate the patient’s discharge for transfer to Jose B. Lingad Hospital in the neighboring province of San Fernando, Pampanga.Do provincial DoH offices have discretionary funds that can be used to “bail out” patients from private hospitals?If so, why just Aimy? Some of Aimy’s neighbors also got struck with dengue and are in the same hospital, so why did DoH Tarlac take Amy and no one else?The hospital staffers said all the hospital employees who witnessed the scene were all surprised.Concerned about mother and child, a hospital employee even asked Leijani if she will have a place to stay in Pampanga. According to the staffer, one of the DoH doctors said they’ll give Leijani a room.One of the staffers told me that it was highly irregular and perplexing.He said there’s a dengue epidemic in Leijani’s village and some of the other dengue victims are admitted in the same hospital. He wondered why DoH-Tarlac took Leijani and Aimy and left everyone else behind.He said they left at 12 noon in a vehicle with DoH-JBL decals (branding).One of them told me in Filipino, “You know, one of their teachers also contracted dengue. Her platelet count is less than 10 so she’s on the 5th floor. Would you like me to bring you to her?”I respectfully declined the offer on humanitarian grounds. The teacher’s platelet count is low so I do not want to subject her to further stress anymore. For all I know, she might start hemorrhaging just by trying to talk.Asked for the names of the DoH doctors, the staffers said they can’t recall the exact names anymore, but one of them said one of the doctors had a surname of “Santos”.Something felt really off so I decided that it’s better if I do not stay in that place for too long. If there’s a massive coverup going on, then it’s not improbable that somebody within the hospital premises may be looking for meI thanked the hospital staffers, quickly exited the building, did a quick 5-minute Facebook live session as proof that I really went there, then immediately left Tarlac.Tarlac, after all, is the home of former President Benigno Aquino, one of the masterminds of the Dengvaxia Scandal.I tried to call Leijani again as soon as we got onto the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, but no one was answering. For some really weird reason, Leijani, the Dengvaxia victim’s mother, doesn’t want to talk to me anymore.I immediately called my friend Sass Rogando Sasot at around 3:35 PM and I told her about what happened. She asked for Leijani’s number and she said she’ll call Leijani herself.The rest of the this section is based on how Sass recounted the events to me.Sass dialed Leijani’s number but it was busy.She dialed it again and it rang. Leijani picked it up.Sass asked Leijani, “I want to donate, where I can I send my donation?”Leijani and her friends were trying to solicit financial help for Amy online since last night. Thus, Leijani shouldn’t be surprised if she gets calls from total strangers, in the same way that she wasn’t surprised when I called her last night.Leijani said, “You can deposit it to a bank account.”Sass asked, “Where are you right now?”“In Pampanga,” Leijani replied.Sass asked,” How did you get there?”Sass heard somebody talk to Leijani and just moments later, Leijani hung up.Available data suggests that DoH Tarlac took just Leijani and her daughter Aimy. They left Tarlac for Pampanga at 12 noon and the call took place at around 3:35 PM so Leijani’s relatives, if any, are unlikely to be there that fast.Who was coaching Leijani, a Health Department employee?Leijani suddenly “came back to life” when she texted me again at 7:33 PM and apologized for not informing me about their transfer. She said she was already groggy out of hunger and exhaustion. She said somebody told her about the Facebook live session I did in the hospital in Tarlac.She admitted that DoH Tarlac offered help and she accepted and that there was no money involved. She said she wasn’t silenced in exchange for money, and all that she wants is a quiet life and what’s best for her daughter.The whole nine yards.I can’t take her word for it anymore because I have reason to believe that her texts were sent under duress. No, she’s in probably in no physical danger, but as a mother, I think she feels the necessity to comply with whoever is necessary, for the sake of her daughter.#DengGate has been raging for almost a week now, but we have yet to hear from a President who’s typically vocal even about the littlest of issues.If Duterte knew about #DengGate, would he be in Greenbelt yesterday to shop as the parents of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lose sleep over the Dengvaxia scandal? That’s not Duterte, so somebody may be keeping the issue away from his eyes… and his daily briefings.I think there’s a coverup going on, from a little bit below the top all the way to a little bit above the bottom. After all, many of them may be complicit to this whole mess, and many of those heads will roll if somebody opens the can of worms.Remember DoH Tarlac.The relative silence of government authorities, the mismatching official statements, the disappointingly scant media coverage of what would otherwise be a major national issue… all of these point to a concerted effort to play down #DengGate.All these, in my opinion, point to a massive coverup.And who are the suspects?Read the title, for starters.

And too be forgotten – by living in decrepit conditions when one is a retired soldier – is not something civilians should accord to these heroes.On the Facebook page of All About the Philippines, the heartbreaking story of one retiree turned viral after photos showed the old man squalidly living on the streets as if he’s uncared for and homeless. Further investigation showed otherwise.According to Manila Channel, the man is identified as Narciso dela Cruz Alpas, a retired Philippine Air Force (PAF) personnel with the rank of staff sergeant (SSg).Alpas, or ‘Tatay Isok’ as he’s fondly called, was enlisted with PAF. He began his illustrious career by being assigned to 356 Engineering Squadron (ES) of the 355th Aviation Engineering Wing (AEW). Said division handles the planning, maintenance, and construction of airways and other infrastructure deemed of high importance by the government.Reports said that Tatay Isok was with the 730 Combat Group in Nasugbu, Batangas before he was designated as part of the 710 Special Operation Wing (SPOW). Note that SPOW is comprised of the elite fighters in PAF.Moreover, the best force under PAF is tasked with coordinating air strikes, explosives disposal, operations and training of canine units and their respective handlers. The SPOW unit is the front-liner in dealing with hostile elements and civilian mass actions.But gone were the days when Tatay Isok risked his life for his fellow Filipino because nowadays, he’s left to his own devices – something risky for a man who seemed to be slowly losing his mind.According to a certain unnamed individual, the retired soldier ‘s monthly pensions were reportedly claimed by his relatives. According to Executive Order 76, as SSg, he’s supposed to receive a total of Php27,997.50, broken down as follows: base pay of Php18,665.00 plus the long pay of Php9,332.50.Fortunately, thanks to social media, his comrades at PAF noticed the call for help for Tatay Isok. According to the Facebook post of PAF, they took him out of the streets in Antique, and he was handed over to the regional office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development.Moreover, the PAF will be handling further arrangements to ensure that Tatay Isok lives a comfortable life – befitting of a hero.Read the original Facebook post of All About the Philippines:Here are some of the outrage expressed by the netizens:",

    "body": "Agot Isidro’s negative statement against President Rodrigo Duterte does not cease from being viral as another personality countered her.This time, a European national defended the president from Isidro’s remarks.European event founder of FIL Malcolm Conlan wrote an open letter for the actress through a Facebook post.Malcolm said that he already met Isidro personally and admitted he has high respect for her and also for her freedom of speech. However, he asserted that it was a wrong move for her to publicly denounce Duterte.In Malcolm’s post, he showed his support for the Philippine president by emphasizing the good in his first 100 days as the president and his dedication and heart for the Philippines and its people.An Open letter to Agot IsidroDear Agot,We are all entitled to our own opinion of course, sometimes if we have something negative on our minds, which may upset or anger others, it may be best as I was advised previously, just to keep it indoors, by all means share with friends and indeed family, but probably not a wise move to have shared so publicly.I have met you before and you were really lovely, so I do of course respect you and your right to freedom of speech. However, to publicly label your President as a ‘psychopath’ was probably not a smart move.President Duterte may be a touch vocal and perhaps some might argue, may not always choose the right terminology when speaking in public. However he speaks from the heart.He has done so much good for the country in his first 100 days as President.He has almost stamped out, or at least greatly reduced corruption in public office. A disease which has riddled the Philippines for too many years now. I am sure now, those in public office would think twice before deviating from the rule of law or not upholding the law properly.He is proposing to increase the validity of the Philippine Passport from 5 to 10 years, he intends to make it easier for OFW’s to travel abroad in search of a better life. Even my own family have benefited from less red tape when dealing with hospitals and public services.Then there is the drug problem, there are over 3 million Filipinos addicted to drugs, so many crimes are committed whilst under the influence of drugs. Under Duterte, look how many drug addicts have surrendered and are now improving their lives and that of their families.I hate the term ‘third world country’ the Philippines is a developing country, which is in fact developing fast.Look how call centres are moving from India to the Philippines. Look how much tourism to the country has increased and there are more opportunities for Filipinos worldwide. With every war, sadly there will be innocent victims sadly caught up in the crossfire, but by and large, I believe that President Duterte is doing his very best to make the Philippines a better place for us all.Finally regarding other countries commenting and indeed criticising Philippine internal affairs, I am sure they would also be upset if we were constantly critical of their laws, policies and behaviour. Look at the amount of innocent people killed in ‘friendly fire’ in other countries, look at the amount of people losing their lives due to their race and many other examples of wrongdoing around the World.Doesn’t President Duterte have a right to stand up for himself?Best wishes Agot, God bless President Duterte, the Philippines and her people.",

    "body": "The vaccine’s anticipated impact on dengue burden is expected to stem from its documented ability to prevent 8 out of 10 dengue hospitalizations and up to 93% of severe dengue that includes hemorrhagic dengue fever that can be fatal in vaccinated study participants 9 years and older.That is, persons who have never had dengue before and were inoculated with Dengvaxia, if infected with the dengue virus, will suffer from the disease as if it was their second dengue infection.A healthy individual gets infected with dengue. He suffers from dengue fever and somehow recovers from it. However, if he gets infected again, the secondary dengue fever will be worse than the first. Suffice it to say, secondary dengue has higher mortality rates than primary dengue.Some severe dengue cases result in organ damage (heart, etc).Now, what did Dengvaxia do to the 4th graders who have no history of dengue?Suppose we have a 4th grader who has never been infected with dengue receives Dengvaxia. If that child gets infected with dengue for the first time, that child will suffer from severe dengue instead of just regular dengue.In short, the child would have been better left without the vaccine, as Dengvaxia increases the dengue mortality rates for recipients who have never been infected with dengue.Simply put, Dengvaxia is poison for those who have never had dengue… but Aquino and Garin wanted it anyway.How did this happen?Concealing Critical Information The DoH and Sanofi were not totally honest.First, the vaccine is a lot less effective to those who have never had dengue.If you have had dengue, the vaccine's efficacy is 81 per cent. However, if you have not been infected with dengue before, this figure is only 38 per cent [The vaccine’s effectiveness against those who have previously been infected with dengue is undeniable. However, the vaccine is a lot less effective if the recipient is seronegative for dengue, i.e. the recipient has no traces of dengue virus in his or her bloodstream.Of course, we can argue that having a vaccine that works only 4 out of 10 attempts is better than having no vaccine at all. And this leads us to the second point, which is…Second and more importantly, health experts have been warning the entire time that Dengvaxia may have considerable adverse effects on seronegative recipients.Senator Richard Gordon, after consulting health experts, has already warned against Dengvaxia in as early as 2015. In a December 2015 press release, he said: The DoH and Sanofi were not totally honest.If you have had dengue, the vaccine's efficacy is 81 per cent. However, if you have not been infected with dengue before, this figure is only 38 per cent [ ST ].The vaccine’s effectiveness against those who have previously been infected with dengue is undeniable. However, the vaccine is a lot less effective if the recipient is seronegative for dengue, i.e. the recipient has no traces of dengue virus in his or her bloodstream.Of course, we can argue that having a vaccine that works only 4 out of 10 attempts is better than having no vaccine at all. And this leads us to the second point, which is…Senator Richard Gordon, after consulting health experts, has already warned against Dengvaxia in as early as 2015. In a December 2015 press release, he said:“…We talked to several health experts and they told us that they had already warned government long before about the possible adverse effect of the new drug on individuals with no prior history of dengue [ Senate ]”.Gordon’s warnings were bolstered by no less than the March 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report just a few months later and just days before Aquino and Garin launched the Mass Vaccination Program.Ironically, this report appears to have been used as the basis of the Mass Vaccination Program.WHO already said over and over that the vaccine may do more harm than good to recipients who have never had dengue prior to inoculation (seronegative)… and WHO said it multiple times BEFORE Garin’s DoH launched the mass immunization program.My gahd, I heyt drahgs!Issuance of WHO Guidelines The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia on 23 December 2015 but it was put on hold five days later pending the release of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [Despite the lack of WHO guidelines, Garin vouched for Dengvaxia just days after the DFA announcement, in an interview with Karen Davila [ The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia on 23 December 2015 but it was put on hold five days later pending the release of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [ GMA ].Despite the lack of WHO guidelines, Garin vouched for Dengvaxia just days after the DFA announcement, in an interview with Karen Davila [ YT ] in 03 January 2016.At the 1:45 mark, Davila asked:Who is the perfect candidate to receive the dengue vaccine? . . . I've never had dengue. Ako ba, should I be vaccinated anytime? Garin replied: Garin replied:Yes. It's recommended for those nine to 45 years old,” Garin said. Oh crap! From where does Garin derive her blind faith on Sanofi and Dengvaxia?!The Aquino government seems to have changed its mind when the Philippines hosted Dengvaxia’s global launch on 11 February 2016 [The Aquino Administration bought P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia in March 2016. Note that all contracts worth in excess of P50 million require the signature of the President.To give Garin the benefit of the doubt, I presume that Garin used the 17 March 2016 WHO guidelines [The problem: that same WHO document contains so many red flags that Garin willfully ignored.Let me list these red flags down one by one.The Aquino government seems to have changed its mind when the Philippines hosted Dengvaxia’s global launch on 11 February 2016 [ CNN ], or over a month before WHO’s 17 March 2016 publication of its background paper Dengue Vaccines on [ WHO ].The Aquino Administration bought P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia in March 2016. Note that all contracts worth in excess of P50 million require the signature of the President.To give Garin the benefit of the doubt, I presume that Garin used the 17 March 2016 WHO guidelines [ WHO ] to justify the April 04 launch of the mass vaccination program, as they are the only guidelines available at the time.The problem: that same WHO document contains so many red flags that Garin willfully ignored.Let me list these red flags down one by one.Red Flag 1: Warning to TravelersPage 5 of the WHO guidelines states, “in travelers unlikely to have already had dengue, vaccination may be substantially less beneficial (and there is a theoretical risk that it may be harmful).”The WHO document advises AGAINST vaccination of travelers who have never had dengue because it may be harmful. Yes, WHO admits that Dengvaxia may be harmful to those who have never been infected with dengue.Red Flag 2: Vaccination can do harmPage 6 of the WHO guidelines states, “Current data suggest substantially lower benefit of vaccination in seronegative individuals 9-45 years of age. There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination could do harm in this population.”WHO says Dengvaxia is a lot less effective to those who’ve never had dengue, and that it may even be harmful to them.Red Flag 3: Lack of ContraindicationsPage 12 says that according to Dengvaxia’s packaging, the drug should NOT be administered to those with severe allergic reactions, those with immune deficiencies such as HIV or AIDS, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.So why was there no contraindication against those who’ve never had dengue?Red Flag 4: Insufficient number of trial samplesPage 19 states, “The number of severe or hospitalized episodes was too small to undertake meaningful analyses stratifying by other factors.”Again, this is an admission that there weren’t enough samples.Red Flag 5: Severe dengue risk if given to seronegative peoplePage 24 states, “The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true primary... infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)”There. Page 24 of the 17 March 2016 WHO document said what Sanofi said just days ago.There probably are more red flags after page 24 of 67, but I believe that discovering five should have been enough to convince authorities to think twice about Dengvaxia.WHY DID AQUINO’s GARIN IGNORE THEM? It’s interesting to note that on 01 April 2016, the Philippine Daily Inquirer published the article “WHO approves PH rollout of dengue vaccine”, even if WHO only essentially said they tolerate the rollout and that they do not necessarily approve of it.Specifically, WHO-Philippines chief Dr. Gundo Weiler said, “It is the prerogative of a country to license the product [In short, Aquino’s Garin rolled out Dengvaxia in contravention of expert opinion.WHO reinforces warnings As if the 17 March 2016 WHO document wasn’t enough, the WHO issued another document a month later that basically reiterated the warnings.On 14 April 2016, or several days after the Aquino Government launched the mass vaccination program, Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine delivered a report entitled “Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV ‘Dengvaxia®’) Clinical Trial Results to the World Health Organization [According to the report (parentheses supplied),“There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination may be ineffective or may even increase risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in those who are seronegative at the time of first vaccination, regardless of age. However, there are few trial data available on older (aged 9 and up) seronegative participants to address this.” Let’s translate that to plain English:“There is a chance that Dengvaxia may be useless or even increase risk of severe dengue to recipients aged 9 and up who have never had dengue, but there’s an insufficient number of trial subjects to confirm this.” And there’s the trial methodology’s fatal flaw because when translated to really, really plain English, the April 2016 WHO report basically says:Dengvaxia is untested on people aged 9 and older AND have never been infected with dengue. That is, in as far as those aged 9 and up and seronegative are concerned, the drug is UNTESTED.Now, here’s the important question: Page 24 states, “The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true primary... infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary… infection (which is typically more severe)”There. Page 24 of the 17 March 2016 WHO document said what Sanofi said just days ago.There probably are more red flags after page 24 of 67, but I believe that discovering five should have been enough to convince authorities to think twice about Dengvaxia.It’s interesting to note that on 01 April 2016, the Philippine Daily Inquirer published the article “WHO approves PH rollout of dengue vaccine”, even if WHO only essentially said they tolerate the rollout and that they do not necessarily approve of it.Specifically, WHO-Philippines chief Dr. Gundo Weiler said, “It is the prerogative of a country to license the product [ Inq ].”In short, Aquino’s Garin rolled out Dengvaxia in contravention of expert opinion.As if the 17 March 2016 WHO document wasn’t enough, the WHO issued another document a month later that basically reiterated the warnings.On 14 April 2016, or several days after the Aquino Government launched the mass vaccination program, Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine delivered a report entitled “Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV ‘Dengvaxia®’) Clinical Trial Results to the World Health Organization [ WHO ].According to the report (parentheses supplied),Let’s translate that to plain English:And there’s the trial methodology’s fatal flaw because when translated to really, really plain English, the April 2016 WHO report basically says:Now, here’s the important question:How many among the 1 million kids aged 9-10 that Aquino and Garin targeted for vaccination with Dengvaxia have been previously infected with dengue?Seropositive, or those who have had the dengue virus in their bloodstream Seronegative, or those who never had the dengue virus in their bloodstream Seroprevalence, meanwhile, refers to the seropositive proportion of the target population. Dengvaxia recipients can be split into two categories:Seroprevalence, meanwhile, refers to the seropositive proportion of the target population.The studies mentioned in the previous sections indicate that Dengvaxia is considerably effective for seropositive recipients and I will not contest that. The problem, however, is what Dengvaxia does to seronegative recipients.",

    "body": "via PEP.PHThe recently concluded Star Magic All Star basketball game held at the Araneta Coliseum ended in controversy as the tension between opposing team members Daniel Padilla and JC De Vera almost escalated into a fight.It started when the two celebrities locked horns in a struggle for the possession of the ball under the ring. In their struggle, JC twisted as Daniel tried to steal the ball but he falls to his knees. He got up unhappy and displayed a reaction that can only be called being upset. He did not swing a punch but instead walked away while muttering something to the referee who was quick enough to intervene.Padilla must've appeared to be very mad so the referee called foul for De Vera. It can be seen in the footage that one of Padilla's teammate was trying to calm him down but he was ignored.The game was temporarily halted because to let things cool down for a bit or risk turning the sport into a brawl that would've ultimately resulted in bruising insured celebrity faces.After the game, leading local entertainment website PEP, interviewed De Vera and asked him about the incident.\"Grabe sya. Ganito pala yung laro nya,\" JC said.\"Nag-sorry ako. Sabi ko, ‘Sorry bro, tumaas lang emotions ko.’ After the game, nag-sorry ulit ako. Sabi ko pasensya na, hindi ko alam na ganito kayo ka-intense,\" he added.Meanwhile, Padilla also told PEP that he was sorry he acted that way during the game and said, “Ako din nag-sorry ako [kay JC] kasi uminit din ako. Siyempre gusto niyo lahat manalo so hindi mawawala ‘yung competitiveness ng lahat. Pero okay lang kami, no problem.”The game reached its conclusion with the Blue Team winning the game by 3 points.The replay of the game will be aired on TV on August 20 and fans are hopeful to see that moment whenwhich almost turned the game into a brawl.",

I believe that opposition is a doorway to growth, di ba? Kasi kung wala namang kumukontra sa ‘yo, that just means na you’re not doing something right. So, with Duterte, he is the current president. I respect him and everything that he’s been doing,” sabi ni Gab.“Maski na there are some things na I’m not for, it doesn’t matter, e. Kasi, at the end of the day, he’s our leader and we have to respect him. And so, with everything that he’s been doing so far, I’m very, very happy. I’m very impressed,” dagdag nito.Natanong din si Gab kung may mga nais ba siyang gawin ng pangulo na para sa kanya ay magandang hakbang para sa bansa?“You know, I think that he has the most powerful and the biggest opportunity to change the Filipino mindset. And one thing na na-realize ko with the Philippines is medyo ang daming negative. And that’s the one thing I wish the Philippines would change, the negativity. Kasi siyempre, pag leader ka and you’re influential, a lot of people will follow you.”“So, my point is for Duterte, if he can be that voice of change, everybody else will follow. So, nakikita ko naman, slowly but surely he’s trying to create that change.”Source: PEPCommentscomments",

    "body": "In light of the issue of Dengvaxia, Atty. Paula Defensor Knack, who claims to be the sister of late Senator Miriam Santiago in her message to the Liberal Party, said that the country is furious at its members and all that they have contributed, and failed to contirbute, to Philippine politics in the past 30 years.“Next time, mag-field kayo ng kandidato na ZERO LAWS PASSED/ ZERO TRACK RECORD as congressman and senator at nanalo lang dahil maraming pera pambili ng TV ADS at dyaryo, at dahil binoto boto nyo for the next 30 years, tingnan nyo ang GALIT NG BAYAN SA KAPALPAKAN NITO,” she said.This was in reaction to the news that former President Benigno Aquino III would likely be held liable due to his failure to observe proper command responsibility in the procurement of P3.5-billion worth of Dengvaxia vaccine, as stated by Senator JV Ejercito.The President might face charges for negligence.Meanwhile, Ejercito said those who had greater culpability were the underlings, the secretaries because they should have done due diligence.Ejercito, who is also the chairman of the Senate health committee, admitted that the Aquino administration made the “rushed” procurement of the dengue vaccine in “good faith.”He added that the concurrence of the senate on the matter is also questionable, as the project was not included in the General Appropriations Act of 2015.The senator said that former Health secretary Janette Garin and former Budget secretary Florencio Abad may be charged with technical malversation for their involvement in the P3.5-billion procurement of the Dengvaxia vaccine.Under the Revised Penal Code, technical malversation is committed by a public official if he or she applies public funds under the administration to some public use, and that the funds were applied in a different purpose under which is originally appropriated by law.He added that the funding for the vaccination program was sourced from the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and Pension Gratuity Fund savings.Source: Paula Defensor KnackCommentscomments",

    "body": "Following a public apology on social media, the woman who slapped an elderly taxi driver changed tune and opted to file a lawsuit instead, claiming that the taxi driver was the “bully.” A report from Kicker Daily confirmed that Cherish Sharmaine Interior filed a complaint about unjust vexation and slight physical injuries against the taxi driver Virgilio Doctor.Earlier this week, Interior and the elderly taxi driver had an altercation in the middle of Congressional Avenue in Quezon City. The 32-year-old call center agent alighted her car and was caught on cam as she shouted repeatedly at the taxi driver, who remained seated inside his car.The incident escalated when the irate call center agent reached out her hand and slapped the taxi driver. Interior’s road rage was publicized after a witness uploaded a video of the incident on social media. Following an online backlash after her video spread like wildfire, Interior posted a long-winded public apology.In the public apology, Interior took responsibility for the incident and claimed that she’s suffering from anger management issues. Suffering the aftermath of her publicized video, she asked people online to spare her relatives and loved ones from the hate.However, several days after her public apology, she changed tune by filing complaints against the driver to the Quezon City Police District. Interior insinuated that the attack was provoked, and the driver had been hitting her knees prior to the video. She was quoted as saying:“Doctor tried to escape so I blocked him, but he kept driving and hit my knee. When my husband told me to get back to our car, I pointed at him, with my hand reaching into his car. When he stepped out of his taxi, he started acting as if I had hit him, because he saw someone taking a video.”On the other hand, the taxi driver also filed cases such as unjust vexation, malicious mischief, and slight physical injuries against his attacker before the QC Prosecutor’s Office. Interior also risks losing her driving license after Doctor appealed to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to revoke her license due to “uncontrollable temper,” as per Inquirer.Meanwhile, Interior risks unemployment after her company, VXI, issued a statement saying that they “do not condone misconduct and any inappropriate behavior” by their employees.What can you say about this? We’d love to hear from you, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. For more updates on the latest happenings, feel free to follow us on Facebook.",

    "body": "0 SHARES Share TweetOur lives would be downright incomplete if we didn’t have our own dreams. Some dreams may appear small, though some of which appear big and some may deem as too ambitious, at least that’s what other people say to Wynona Pauline Catapang, who was ridiculed with countless remarks similar to that. But this super woman proves her haters not to underestimate the perseverance of someone who dreams big.Wynona was among those who were deemed as too dull-minded to stay in college for five years. Little did they know that this lady is taking three undergraduate degrees at once.Wynona, then, vented out her 5-year college experience through a lengthy graduation post on Facebook. She started her post with the pessimistic remarks she received,“Ay bobo 5 years na sa collegeWala ka pang napapatunayanMasyadong ambisyosa”Wynona looked back to the various stress factors she has encountered.“5 years. 5 years of hardships, stress, and tears. I remembered the days na nagkasabay ang thesis ng psych at masscom. Psych classes sa morning, production sa hapon hanggang gabi. Thesis pagkauwi. Shoot sa mga delikadong lugar while writing Psychological report. Thesis defense sa Masscom tapos thesis proposal naman sa Psych. Di magkanda ugaga every first day of sem kasi laging overlapping yung subjects sa given sched. Pabalik balik kay Dean at sa Reg para lang maayos yung sched. Different faces for every subject. Haha. Parang irreg ang peg. Laging nahuhuli sa mga announcement kasi wala sariling classrep. Kapagod.”She reminisced on the hurdles she had to leap over in order to move forward.“Then I was then questioning myself, worth it pa ba lahat? I was about to give up and drop my other course. It was so hard to maintain a cut-off grade especially that both of my courses have quota grade of B minus. Ang taas beshie. Both courses pa. There was a time na na-on probation na ko kasi naleleft behind ko na yung isang course. Tapos this Feb, I was so stressed sa thesis because of the deadline tapos my lola died pa.”She continued,“But then I guess God took me to this path and I had to deal with it. Kahit sabi ng iba wala pa kong napapatunayan sa mundo, na ambisyosa ako, I believe this would have been my greatest achievement in life as of now—to receive three degrees at the age of 21.”“But then I guess God took me to this path and I had to deal with it. Kahit sabi ng iba wala pa kong napapatunayan sa mundo, na ambisyosa ako, I believe this would have been my greatest achievement in life as of now- to receive 3 degrees at the age of 21.”She then revealed her secret, which is “diskarte.”The St. Scholastica’s College graduate thanked those people who helped her throughout her journey. She started off with her friends, then her parents who provided her needs and supported her in achieving her milestone.The hardworking gal capped off her post with her name along with the degrees she has attained,“CATAPANG, WYNONA PAULINE MAGBANUABachelor of Arts in Mass Communication minor in Development CommunicationBachelor of Science in PsychologyBachelor of Arts in Guidance and Counseling5-YEAR LIA/LIA PROGRAM”Congratulations on your feat, Wynona!Here are the comments from the netizens:What can you say about the inspiring college journey of Wynona?

    "body": "Even for those who’ve spent days in the presence of this massive fire, tramping through ash and soot and carpets of nails from burned-down houses, the sight of Colina Vista Street in the city of Ventura is something different.The destruction is almost complete. House after house after house after house is, in the language of firefighters, on the ground.On Thursday, a firefighter died while fighting the blaze in coastal mountains northwest of Los Angeles.Walking slowly down Colina Vista, Jonathan Cox, a fire captain with Cal Fire, says, “The first sinking feeling you always get is, not again.”He spent his summer with the crews fighting the massive, deadly Tubbs Fire in California’s wine country. Now this. The Thomas Fire burned through here days ago, but houses are still collapsing, still burning.‘The first sinking feeling you always get is, not again,’ Cal Fire Capt. Jonathan Cox says. ‘If you would have told me five years ago that in December you’re going to be on a fire where you see 1,000 homes destroyed right before Christmas, I would have said you’re crazy.’ (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)“A lot of people think that once the fire goes through, the fire’s done,” Cox says. “But there are certain areas of heat that stick around for weeks if not months.”These Italian-style villas in the hills now more closely resemble Roman ruins. Metal tires have melted into puddles. Plastic garbage cans have bubbled into unrecognizable Dali-esque objets d’art. In one long stretch, little is left standing except a row of chimneys.Cox, a veteran of 14 years, can’t believe what he’s seeing.“If you would have told me five years ago that in December you’re going to be on a fire where you see 1,000 homes destroyed right before Christmas, I would have said you’re crazy.”Over the last decade, California’s fire season has increased by about 70 days. “This is the front line of climate change,’ Cox says. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)California’s fire season is 70 days longer than it was just 15 years ago. This year, unusually high winds and dry air were part of the problem. But it has taken more than just bad luck to create the size and severity of the megafires like the Tubbs in Northern California and the Thomas in Southern California.“This is the front line of climate change right here,” Cox says. “This is where the heat and the extremes are meeting the realities of humans.”Wildfires in the U.S. burn twice as long, cover twice as much territory and destroy three times as many homes as they did 10 years ago. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)When Cox was a relative rookie 10 years ago in the Sacramento area, fires in the U.S. burned on average half as long, consumed half as much area, cost the federal government one-third of what it does now to fight, and burned one-third fewer homes.California Gov. Jerry Brown, touring the region recently, said huge blazes like the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa and the Thomas Fire in Ventura County could be the ‘new normal.’ (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)The biggest factor behind much of the rise in the devastation caused by these fires: all the houses were built near wild, fire-prone areas.According to the International Code Council’s Report on Wildland-Urban Interface, since 1990, 60 per cent of new construction in the U.S. has occurred close to wilderness.Sixty per cent of new construction in the U.S. is happening near wild areas. High temperatures and strong winds in those areas create an ‘inevitable intersection of disaster,’ Cox says. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)“You move people into those areas and you get wind events and extreme, extreme change in climates, and you have this inevitable intersection of disaster,” Cox says. “And what we fear is that these large and damaging fires are kind of the new normal in this state.”“The new normal” echoes a phrase used by California Governor Jerry Brown recently as he toured wildfire-singed Ventura.Firefighters advocate a 30-metre buffer between houses and any large swaths of flammable vegetation, but in many cases in southern California the buffer is only a couple of metres at most. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)What Cox is seeing in this blackened neighbourhood of Ondulando is typical of many of the hardest-hit areas: homes built much too close to the bush. Firefighters advocate a 30-metre buffer between houses and any large swaths of flammable vegetation, but in many cases here the buffer is only a couple of metres at most.“And then there’s also the different types of vegetation,” Cox says. “The native fire-resistant vegetation obviously tends to fare better than the ornamental vegetation that’s out there.”Native fire-resistant species of vegetation are being replaced by invasive species that burn much more readily, experts say. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)The problem is, experts say fire-resistant species are slowly disappearing because of the unusual frequency of the fires, replaced with exotic species that burn much more readily.Cox says the only way to limit such fire damage is to change where, and especially how, people build.Experts say the only way to combat the growing cost of megafires is to change where and how houses are built. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)The important factors are “what the buildings are made out of, what the street width looks like, what the vegetation around it looks like, and more importantly in the bigger scale, what kind of fuel management we can do around a community so that when a fire does start it doesn’t have a continuous fuel bed.”",

Rody Duterte gives a 10-day ultimatum to billionaire Lucio Tan to pay his alleged debt to the national government or else he will force to close the Airport of the country’s flag-carrier, Philippine Airlines (PAL).According to Pres. Duterte one of those obligations by the company owned by the Taipan, Lucio Tan is the rental of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) runway.The former Mayor of Davao City and the very first President from Mindanao also noted on his tirades against the Filipino-Chinese businessman, he don’t care about the business of Tan, because he did not received any campaign donation from one of the country’s richest individual.Based upon the documents and records of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) needs at least P30-Billion from Lucio Tan due to their tax obligations.Pres. Duterte also noted during his speech and tirades to businessman Lucio Tan that “Alam mo, basta iyong ano… Basta kayong walang – mga abogado man tayo lahat dito. You tell your clients “Pay the tax correctly.” Iyong isa dito ano, sabi niya – I did not accept. I did not accept his money. He is a contributor.“At sabihin ko na. Lucio Tan, donor of funds. Sabi ko, “No?” Sabi ko, “Thank you, but -“And the other guys there. Sabi ko, you are using government buildings, airport, have a back… back – utang diyan sa runway ‘di mo binabayaran.” Sabi ko, “You solve the problem yourself. I will give you 10 days. Bayaran mo, ‘pag di mo bayaran, eh ‘di sarhan ko.” Wala nang airport. So what ?” Pres. Duterte said.Lucio Tan is a Chinese Filipino billionaire, businessman and educator with interests in banking, airline, real estate industries and education to name a few.

The former hockey enforcers fought multiple times in major junior and in the National Hockey League.But now, with Stephen Peat facing a very different kind of fight, his former foe wants to help.According to Peat’s father, Walter, the former NHLer is living on the streets of the Fraser Valley, using drugs and could be close to death.After reading the CBC story on Peat’s situation, Purinton reached out to the CBC and to the Peat family in the hopes of connecting Stephen with help. And he’s doing it for one reason: he’s been there.‘You’re kind of playing out your dreams in a way, but what are you giving up for that?,” Purinton said.“Unfortunately, some people are giving up their lives and their health … [former fighters] can relate to the sadness and to the darkness.”Purinton has had significant challenges of his own in his post-hockey life. He’s faced symptoms common with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a concussion-related brain injury, including depression. He used drugs and alcohol and even faced a burglary charge in the United States that could’ve landed him in jail for up to 25 years.Former NHL enforcer Stephen Peat is currently living on the street and using drugs, according to his father. (Gary Tramontina/Associated Press)The life parallels between Peat and Purinton go beyond hockey. Purinton visited Peat at a rehab centre on Vancouver Island when he was staying there in 2015. Only a year later, Purinton was attending that very centre to address problems of his own.Purinton says he can help find Stephen the funding to go into treatment, but he has to want to go.“I support him and I’m here for him and I can’t give advice … I just have to be open to listen to him,” said Purinton.“I got his back and I just want to see him get well.”Former Rangers defenceman Dale Purinton is reaching out to his former foe, Stephen Peat, in the hopes of connecting him with treatment options. (Rick Stewart/Getty Images/File)Other former enforcers reach outRiley Cote was a fearsome fighter for the Philadelphia Flyers between 2006 and 2010, and, now, he’s the co-founder of Athletes 4 Care, an organization that advocates for medical marijuana use for current and former athletes.He’s also reached out to Stephen and Walter Peat in the hopes of helping.“He’s not alone and there’s a huge group of people who would love to offer him support. There’s hope for everyone,” Cote said.“He’s in a dark place right now and there are people around who are willing to help him get out of this funk.”James McEwan fought 200 times in his hockey career and was recently featured in a CBC story about fighting in junior hockey. He believes there’s still plenty of hope for Peat.“My message to him is that healing is possible and no matter how tough things are right now, it is possible to bounce back and to come out of this,” McEwan said.“He can heal and become balanced and strong again.”Contacting StephenLike the CBC, the former fighters have reached out to Stephen directly, via text and email. He sometimes replies but then goes days or weeks without responding to follow-up messages.In his latest message to the CBC, Peat took issue with some of what his father said in the initial article but did not elaborate.All three enforcers say they’ll continue to pursue contact with Peat in the hopes of connecting him with treatment.",

Nobody ever found such video, though, and that is because it's most likely no more than a hoax being spread online by black hat bloggers for their personal gains.An interview with Police Chief Inspector Jovie Espinido wherein he stated that some politicians in Ozamiz tried to bribe him with sexual favors in the past only gave credence to the existence of a scandalous video of Parojinog whom the netizens quickly figured the inspector was talking about.Malicious bloggers and internet marketers saw the opportunity for their personal gains, hence the birth of a made up scandal that actually doesn't exist, at least at the moment.Even our resident scandal expert, who have found and watched countless materials of such nature for the sake of journalism, of course (duh), also said that he had scoured all known platforms in the internet where such footage might have been uploaded but to no avail. He also said that it was just a sheer waste of time to search for it. He kinda looks frustrated, actually. It was written on his face that he firmly believes such video of the Ozamiz vice mayor does not exist.Most people who tried searching for the said video only found themselves watching the replay of PTV news report below which most certainly does not contain what its thumbnail shows:Wait there's more.We here at Pinoy News Blogger always remind our readers that spreading malicious content on the internet such as the so called, if ever it exists, is against the law.",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Tuesday, March 4th, 2014Millions of pounds of garbage and sewer water all piled up in Metro Manila’s filthy waterways maybe now be put to good use, thanks to an ingenious invention by a young Lieutenant from Pasig.Lt. Genio Imbentor, a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy’s Masiglahi Class of 2009 invented a device that can propel either garbage, sewer water, or both at a distant target. The large 30-foot long metallic tube contraption resembles a German World War II-era 88mm anti-aircraft cannon, and uses the same natural gas extracted from the decaying garbage and sewer water as propellant. Garbage and sewer water can be aimed at a target up to half a kilometer away at an astonishing accuracy.Lt. Imbentor says that he and the Engineering battalion he is assigned to have been testing the device for over a few months, using garbage and sewer water dredged from the Pasig river. They found that the quality of the decomposing garbage is perfect to ignite and propel the garbage and sewer at a long distance.The young crafty lieutenant said that he came up with the idea after their unit was assigned to oversee dredging work along the Pasig river about three years ago, when he noticed the pungent smell the retrieved rubbish and sewage was emanating. He had suspicion that it could be natural gas. He then held a lighter next to the decaying black sludge and the resulting combustion blew him and three others away at least 15 feet.“We were lucky we had protective suits on. Otherwise, we would have been dead by then,” Imbentor said.At that point, he did some research and found blueprints of old German World War II era 88mm anti-aircraft cannons, to which he designed the garbage cannons from.Imbentor claims that his invention can be the perfect retaliatory device against the water cannons the Chinese Navy used to drive Filipino fishermen away from the disputed Scarborough Shoals, just recently.“The tests have so far been a success, and we have been contacted by the Navy so the device can be used for the country’s defense,” Imbentor revealed.Eritas Times was able to get in touch with the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Operations (N3) Captain Likasna Mandaragat to confirm Imbentor’s revelation, but the Captain only said that “it is a matter of national security, and I cannot confirm nor deny Lt. Imbentor’s statement.”Calls to GHQ-J3 in Camp Aguinaldo have not been returned as of this writing.",

The person who found them was Dexter Carlos Sr ., a security guard working at a bank in Makati and one of the victim’s husband. According to Dexter, he arrived home at around 8:45 am from his nightshift job but was surprised when no one opened the gate for him. He then climbed the gate only to see his mother-in-law, wife, and children massacred in their home.On June 28 , one of the suspects of the Bulacan massacre, 26-year-old Carmelo Ibanez , was arrested. Following his apprehension, he confessed to committing the heinous crime.Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr. , Bulacan police director, asked him why he did such a thing. Ibañez, a construction worker, said in an exclusive interview with ABS-CBN:“Wala lang po, parang trip-trip lang… Naisipan lang pasukin, ganoon. Hindi naman po sinadya namin na talagang — kusa lang pong pinasok.”Of the 5 victims of the Bulacan massacre, 2 women were r*ped by Ibañez and his two other companions, Tony and Inggo .According to Ibañez, the three suspects collectively did P150 worth of shabu during their drinking session before they decided to go to the Carlos residence to murder the people living there. When asked why they also killed the children, he simply said he didn’t know that there were any. He said:“Hindi po namin alam na may bata doon, ano na po kasi sa droga… Iyung mga bata, nakaka-meet ko rin po iyun. Minsan po kasi, nanood iyun sa kabila, sa ano ng ate ko, bahay.”He then asked the family to forgive him for what he had done. Ibañez said:“Ako po ang pumatay sa kanilang lahat. Nagsisi po ako sa ginawa ko po. Sana po ay mapatawad po ako kasi po lulong po ako sa droga saka po sa alak po. Pasensya na po kayo.”Watch ABS-CBN’s full interview with the suspect below:",

John Lloyd Cruz is also shortlisted before taking Ellen Adarna as love life.When it comes to fine tastes that spread from gourmet cuisine to master paintings to multi-karat diamonds, nobody beats Enrique who puts his television, film and advertising top-bracket income into high-return investments. This makes Enrique as the country’s youngest celebrity connoisseur at 25.A seven-figure bulk deal, Enrique acquired six paintings by Old Masters including a Juan Luna, a Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo and a Nena Saguil on the second day of the ongoing Heras (Pamana)Old Masters, Contemporary and National Artists exhibit by Bicol Antique Arts and Craft at The Carmen Hotel, Peñafrancia Ave., Naga City.Enrique purchased online Luna’s watercolor study for the cover of Diario de Manila Nov. 30, 1894 issue of a winged creature in flight battling Japanese warriors.Known for his European motifs, Hidalgo rendered Untitled (Undated), a rare graphite sketch in mint condition of a landscape-cum-seascape of a very rural scene dotted with a nipa hut, coconut trees and bamboo bushes.From left: Untitled by Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo; Diario de Manila by Juan Luna; Captured Cosmos by Nena Saguil From left: Untitled by Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo; Diario de Manila by Juan Luna; Captured Cosmos by Nena SaguilPre-figuring her well-known cellular style as viewed from a microscope, Saguil’s Captured Cosmos (1964) shows vari-sized spheres, vortices, dots and bubbles in white, red, black and cobalt blue, expressing a deep sense of spirituality.Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Serafin Serna’s A Man in Native Costume and A Woman in Native Costume (1955), vivid oil on canvas of the half-body portraits of royalties in pre-colonial costumes.Simeon Saulog’s Untitled (1967), watercolor of stallions on the run.Facilitated by curator-cum-art dealer Jay Cuarto, he reopened in 2006 the ‘60s famous antique dealership of his departed father, Jesus Cuarto Sr. “I am humbled to be given this opportunity to take on my father’s legacy and to live up to his name,” Jay pays tribute to the Cuarto patriarch.",

Previously, it was reported that he replied back to some male netizens who commented on Jessy Mendiola’s bikini picture on Instagram.He took their comments in a joking manner but it was evident in his tone and words that he was not amused.In another incident, he also replied to his one of his followers who called him out for sharing a picture of a wounded finger. The netizen’s sensibilities were offended but the host commented, “may kuku po? Naka 5110 po ba kayo? :)”While he didn’t explain his statement any further, Luis took it down on his Instagram feed. Now, the host is once again being slammed by the online community for another one of his latest posts.Approximately 16 hours ago as of this writing, he shared a black and white picture of Jackie Chan with the text, “On December 16, 2017 at exactly 3:01pm, Jackie Chan peacefully passed by a store in Koreatown, NYC today at age 63.”While it didn’t exactly say that the famous Hong Kong action movie star had passed, some netizens felt offended and said that Luis should delete his post.Based on Fashion Pulis’ report, they were not amused that Luis Manzano would share such a thing. For the record, the picture – or meme – has been going viral all over social media sites for the past few days.Even though Luis didn’t necessarily create the post on his own, the public still shared their opinions about it and warned him about posting such things.Luis, being the funny guy that he is, took some time to reply to their comments with his trademark quips. Some of his replies were:“i bet you are the type that always falls for fake news [with laughing-with-tears emoji]” “slightly used siguro utak mo no? I benta na! [with laughing-with-tears emoji]”Meanwhile, here are the rest of his replies:What do you think about Luis Manzano replying back to those netizens about his post on Jackie Chan? If you were in his position, would you also reply the same? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!",

    "body": "Risa the Kidnapper? The elements of the crime of \"Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention\" are [That the offender is a private individual. That he kidnaps or detains another, or in any other manner deprives the latter of his liberty. That the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal. That in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present: The elements of the crime of \"Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention\" are [ JLP-Law ]:That the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than five (5) days; orThat it committed simulating public authority; orThat any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; orThat the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.Element 1: That Risa is a private individual. Yesterday, PAO Chief Persida Acosta called out Senator Risa Hontiveros for refusing to turn over the underage witnesses, despite the fact that it’s PAO, along with NBI, DOJ, and PNP, that has the mandate to protect them [If the offender is a public officer, the crime committed would be arbitrary detention, but the public officer must have a duty under the law to detain a person. Since senators have no duty to detain or take custody witnesses (only PAO, NBI, DOJ, and PNP has such authority), Senator Hontiveros shall be prosecuted as a private individual.This fulfills the first element. Yesterday, PAO Chief Persida Acosta called out Senator Risa Hontiveros for refusing to turn over the underage witnesses, despite the fact that it’s PAO, along with NBI, DOJ, and PNP, that has the mandate to protect them [ GMA ].If the offender is a public officer, the crime committed would be arbitrary detention, but the public officer must have a duty under the law to detain a person. Since senators have no duty to detain or take custody witnesses (only PAO, NBI, DOJ, and PNP has such authority), Senator Hontiveros shall be prosecuted as a private individual.This fulfills the first element.Element 2: That Risa kidnaps or detains the minors The two victims are minors, so parental consent was required before she took custody, i.e. before she limited their liberty. However, in an interview with TV Patrol, one of the minors’ parents said [“Actually, hindi ko alam eh. Hindi tama. Yun po yung isang foul din e. Bago po nila kukunin yung anak ko, kunin muna nila yung permiso sa akin kung papayag ba ako na sa kanilang panig ko ibibigay. Unang-una po yang Hontiveros na yan di po, hindi ko po siya nakakausap. Hindi man lang niya hinanap muna kung paano makokontak ang ina ng witness dahil minor po yan eh.”Translation: Actually, I wasn’t informed. That’s wrong. That’s foul. Before they take custody of my child, they should asked permission from me, if I will agree to give their side custody of my child. First and foremost is that Hontiveros, I haven’t spoken to her. She didn’t even find a way to contact the mother of the witness despite the witness being a minor. The fact that Risa did not secure consent from the parents means she kidnapped these underage witnesses. The two victims are minors, so parental consent was required before she took custody, i.e. before she limited their liberty. However, in an interview with TV Patrol, one of the minors’ parents said [ FB ]:The fact that Risa did not secure consent from the parents means she kidnapped these underage witnesses.This fulfills the second element.Element 3: That Risa’s illegally took custody of the minors The DOJ is the sole implementor of the Witness Protection Act [Now, it may be argued that the minors – aged 16 and 13 – agreed or even volunteered to be taken into Hontiveros’ custody. However, parental consent is required in cases like these, something that Hontiveros failed to secure, as shown in the TV Patrol interview cited in the previous section.Moreover, Hontiveros essentially induced two minors to abandon their homes, thereby violating Article 271 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:Art. 271. Inducing a minor to abandon his home. — The penalty of prision correccional and a fine not exceeding seven hundred pesos shall be imposed upon anyone who shall induce a minor to abandon the home of his parents or guardians or the persons entrusted with his custody. Hence, the detention of the minors, even if supposedly protective in nature, is illegal.This fulfills the third element. This fulfills the second element.The DOJ is the sole implementor of the Witness Protection Act [ RA 6981 ]. Although the DOJ may call upon other executive agencies to implement the law, what’s clear is that the Senate is not an executive agency. That is, the Senate – along with any or all the Senators – have no legal authority to take protective custody of witnesses.Now, it may be argued that the minors – aged 16 and 13 – agreed or even volunteered to be taken into Hontiveros’ custody. However, parental consent is required in cases like these, something that Hontiveros failed to secure, as shown in the TV Patrol interview cited in the previous section.Moreover, Hontiveros essentially induced two minors to abandon their homes, thereby violating Article 271 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:Hence, the detention of the minors, even if supposedly protective in nature, is illegal.This fulfills the third element.Element 4: Circumstances Recall that the fourth element is the presence of any of the following circumstances in the commission of the offense:(a) That the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than five (5) days; or(b) That it committed simulating public authority; or(c) That any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or(d) That the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer. Hontiveros clearly simulated the authority of PAO, NBI, DOJ, and/or PNP, thereby fulfilling the second condition. Moreover, the persons kidnapped are two minors, fulfilling the fourth condition. Now, the fourth element requires the presence of ANY of the circumstances enumerated, so the presence of (b) and (d) is more than enough.Suffice it to say, this fulfills the fourth element.In short, Senator Risa Hontiveros can be sued – and will very likely be convicted – for kidnapping and serious illegal detention of the two minors. Recall that the fourth element is the presence of any of the following circumstances in the commission of the offense:Hontiveros clearly simulated the authority of PAO, NBI, DOJ, and/or PNP, thereby fulfilling the second condition. Moreover, the persons kidnapped are two minors, fulfilling the fourth condition. Now, the fourth element requires the presence of ANY of the circumstances enumerated, so the presence of (b) and (d) is more than enough.Suffice it to say, this fulfills the fourth element.Prison sentencesHontiveros also violated Article 271 or inducing minors to abandon their home, where the penalty is imprisonment ranging from six months to six years. Again, she may be guilty of TWO counts.Hontiveros also committed Obstruction of Justice [(30+30) + (6+6) + (6+6+6) = 90With these said, Hontiveros faces the prospect of having to stay for up to 90 years behind bars. The overeager Hontiveros, blinded by political ambition, committed kidnapping and serious illegal detention that is punishable by reclusion perpetua [ Gov ], i.e. 30-year prison term. Note that she took custody of TWO minors, so she may even be found guilty of TWO COUNTS of kidnapping and serious illegal detention, translating to up to 60 years in prison.Hontiveros also violated Article 271 or inducing minors to abandon their home, where the penalty is imprisonment ranging from six months to six years. Again, she may be guilty of TWO counts.Hontiveros also committed Obstruction of Justice [ P.D. 1829 ], as she prevented witnesses from reporting the commission of any offense or the identity of any offender/s by means of force, in light of her having kidnapped the underage witnesses and PAO Chief Acosta having to call her out for refusing to turn over the same. Again, she may be guilty of TWO (or even up to three) counts. The penalty is imprisonment ranging from six months to six years per count.(30+30) + (6+6) + (6+6+6) = 90With these said, Hontiveros faces the prospect of having to stay for up to 90 years behind bars.Who can sue? For Obstruction of Justice, the DOJ, PAO, NBI, or PNP can sue her.As for [1] kidnapping serious illegal detention and [2] inducing a minor to abandon his home, any parent or household member can sue Senator Hontiveros. However, anybody who has personal knowledge of the commission of the offense may also file a case. Since Hontiveros was stupid enough to broadcast her deeds on national TV, everyone can be presumed to have personal knowledge, i.e. VIRTUALLY ANYONE CAN SUE HER.Moreover, since the two witnesses are minors and no legal guardian has come forward, the concept of parens patriae (parent of the nation) applies.In Nery vs. Lorenzo, [Concerning the protection of minors, the State's role as parens patriae burdens it with “the duty of protecting the rights of persons or individual who because of age or incapacity are in an unfavorable position, vis-a-vis other parties. Unable as they are to take due care of what concerns them, they have the political community to look after their welfare. Moreover, in Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Del Monte Piedad [The prerogative of parens patriae is inherent in the supreme power of every State and is often necessary to be exercised in the interest of humanity and for the prevention of injury to those who cannot protect themselves. That is, should a parent or household member of the underage witnesses fail to file a case, the Department of Justice (DoJ) or even the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), can file a case instead, a case that is very likely to send the overeager Senator to jail.

Yes, because Esmaquel all-too-conveniently forgot to include several important details, details that will make his article fall apart.Esmaquel reported about a 08 May 2009 US Embassy diplomatic cable, which suggests Duterte’s complicity to the legendary vigilante group Davao Death Squad (DDS).The embassy cable, written by then-US Ambassador to Manila Kristie Kenney, states: looked for the diplomatic cable that Esmaquel quoted. It was entitled “ DAVAO OFFICIALS DENY VIGILANTE KILLINGS, BUT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BLAMES MAYOR ”. The quoted paragraph above was taken from the fifth point in the cable.At first glance, the article’s premise already sounds problematic because it basically states Esmaquel allegedly heard it from Wikileaks who allegedly heard it from Kenney who allegedly heard it from Sipaco who allegedly heard it from Duterte.Basically, Esmaquel gave us double hearsay evidence at best, quadruple hearsay at worst. In as far as the validity of evidence, this situation is no different from the “ Sampalan sa BPI Julia Vargas ” incident, where disgraced Senator Antonio Trillanes allegedly heard something from a Joseph de Mesa who heard something from an alleged AMLC insider.These claims will not be admissible in court.One of the Rappler article commenters already pointed this out. In reply to that comment, another person suggested that a proper investigating body should verify this information from Wikileaks.Fair enough, so  asks, “Has this lead been investigated, or is this a totally new lead?”The same leaked US diplomatic cable [ Wikileaks ] also stated:Moreover, on the section indicating the Ambassador’s comments, Kenney wrote:Given these additional quotes, the reader will surely ask, “So what?”The diplomatic cable shows it was prepared in May 2009, and it said it was being written during CHR’s ongoing investigation on DDS. Sipaco, the “witness”, is actually CHR Region XI Director.Now, who was CHR Chairperson during those times? GMA ].Sipaco’s allegations in the leaked diplomatic cables is actually part of set of claims that led to CHR’s 2009 investigation into Duterte’s alleged involved with the Davao Death Squad. Yes, Sipaco’s claims were already investigated by no less than Senator Leila de Lima herself, while the latter was still headed by the Commission on Human Rights.De Lima actually spearheaded this investigation, so actively that she even broke our country’s laws in a desperate bid to prove her point.On 16 July 2009, two months after the publication of the diplomatic cable, Panabo City inmate Jonathan Balo sued De Lima, House Speaker Prospero Nograles and six other people for allegedly taking him out of his detention cell without a court order [ Star ].Balo didn’t want to leave his cell in fear of being summarily executed.Nevertheless, Balo was illegally taken out of his cell and told he’ll be taken to a police station to identify a suspect. Upon reaching the police station, he was transferred to another vehicle and brought to the Laud quarry site in Ma-a, Davao City. There, he was forced to admit being a DDS member.Balo was brought to the Laud quarry site at a time when a CHR-led team was searching the area for the supposed remains of victims of the DDS, a vigilante group.The 2009 CHR investigation headed by de Lima and of which Sipaco was part ended some time in 2012, as page 16 of CHR’s 2012 Annual Report states [ CHR ]:This recommendation basically instructs three government agencies – Ombudsman, NBI, and DOJ – to take action.Interestingly, by the time the CHR issued its recommendations, De Lima was already Justice Secretary, after having been appointed as such as soon as President Aquino took his 2010 oath of office [ GMA ].Thus, de Lima actually had control over both the Department of Justice and all its agencies, including the National Bureau of Investigation. That is, de Lima’s DOJ appointment after her CHR chairmanship placed her in the best position to see the DDS issue resolved once and for all.After six years at the DOJ’s helm, De Lima admitted on 20 August 2016 that the CHR failed to file cases against Duterte or his aides for lack of evidence when she said, “We don’t have enough evidence against them [ MT ].”NBI and DOJ’s effort reached a dead end so there’s only one agency left to talk about: the Ombudsman.The Ombudsman ordered the investigation of the DDS issue closed and terminated for lack of evidence, the same reason cited by De Lima herself.On 15 January 2016, the Ombudsman’s Field Investigation Office issued a final disposition addressed to CHR Chair Gascon, part of which reads [ OMB ]:Yes, the Ombudsman cited insufficient evidence too.What’s more interesting, however, is that Sipaco was quoted in the document.Sipaco said, “It would be unbecoming of the Commission if through chismis and other gossips, we would be relying on it as fact already when there are no supporting justification.”Yes, Sipaco said that himself. Yes, the same Sipaco who allegedly told Ambassador Kenney that Duterte admitted involvement in DDS. Yes, the same Sipaco cited in Wikileaks.Sipaco said DDS was “chismis” (gossip), the same Sipaco who released the statement that was the central premise of Paterno Esmaquel’s piece.With that, Esmaquel’s Rappler article falls apart, just like most of what he has written before.Let’s go back to the article’s title:Esmaquel basically tells us that Wikileaks suggest Duterte’s complicity with DDS. However, Wikileaks’ ultimate source was Sipaco, who dismissed DDS claims as gossip AFTER the publication of the leaked cable.Now, some camps will argue that Sipaco could’ve been pressured by Duterte, but remember that Sipaco was under the protection of Liberal Party-led Malacañang from mid-2010 to mid-2016, and that the Liberal Party has repeatedly tried (and failed) to destroy Duterte during the campaign period [ TP: Destroy Duterte ].A lowly city mayor can scare off someone fully backed by the Office of the President?No, that claim shall not fly.Paterno tried to resuscitate his article when he wrote:The problem, however, is that Matobato has been proven to be a pathological liar.Matobato has given several conflicting statements, three of which are cited here:: Matobato confessed to killing certain Sali Makdum, whom Matobato claimed was an international terrorist targeted by DDS [ GMA ]. As it turns out, Makdum is Matobato’s relative by marriage who wanted to buy land from Matobato [ CNN ]. Matobato was previously engaged in buying and selling of land.: Matobato said DDS killed billionaire Richard King inside a McDonald’s restaurant. The problem, however, is that King’s own family knows he was killed in an office building [ Star ].: Matobato previously claimed to have not executed a sworn affidavit in 2014. As it turns out, he actually did, and the claims in that 2014 affidavit thoroughly contradict Matobato’s claims in the Senate hearings [ Star ].On 23 September 2016, Senate Justice Committee Chair Richard Gordon said, \"You have to test his credibility, you have to test his memory, you have to test events. And he was changing stories [ ABS ].\"Matobato’s consistencies have also been pointed out by Senators Panfilo Lacson [ Star ], Manny Pacquiao [ GMA ], Alan Peter Cayetano [ CNN ], and Sonny Angara [ Inq ].Meanwhile, the only ones who stand by Matobato’s credibility are Senators Leila de Lima [ CNN ] and Antonio Trillanes [ AJ ].De Lima backing Matobato is not a surprise: it was her who sneaked Matobato into the senate hearings to begin with. Her “faith” in Matobato was expected.Trillanes, on the other hand, is the same senator who believed in hearsay when he accused Duterte of corruption during the last weeks of the campaign period, an accusation that he sorely failed to substantiate [ TP: BangkoSerye ].So the only two senators backing Matobato is one who harbors a clear conflict of interest, and one who has cried “Wolf!” too many times.In the Rappler article, all Esmaquel did was add to the noise without adding value into the conversation. Esmaquel seriously lacks research skills, a basic skill that’s expected from him, especially since he has a master’s in Journalism and a bachelor’s in Communication, both from the Ateneo.Mr. Esmaquel, Ateneo is a really good school. Thus, I will give the Ateneo the benefit of the doubt by saying that you just happen to be a statistical outlier. [  Did you like this post? Help  stay up!

    "body": "The fuzzy covering on reindeer antlers could hold the key to scar-free, speedy healing for severe human skin injuries and burns, say researchers in southern Alberta.The hairy skin on reindeer antlers, known as velvet, has the ability to “almost perfectly” regenerate in a way that hasn’t been observed in any other large mammal, said Jeff Biernaskie, associate professor at the University of Calgary’s department of comparative biology and experimental medicine.He and a group of researchers are studying how exactly that happens, because they want to replicate those results in human skin regeneration.The reindeer being studied as part of research into human skin regeneration are part of a herd acquired in 2008 by the University of Calgary’s faculty of veterinary medicine. (Dave Will/CBC)A series of experiments were conducted on reindeer, also known as caribou in North America. Researchers made small wounds on their velvet, and similar small wounds on different parts of the animals’ bodies while anesthetized.While the latter scarred, the cuts on the velvet virtually disappeared within a month, covered by new skin with the normal level of pigmentation and hair follicles, Biernaskie said.“[It’s] a remarkable feat that’s really not observed in any other large animal at all,” said the researcher.Biernaskie, who also serves as the Calgary Firefighters Burn Treatment Society chair, suggested those regenerative properties could one day be harnessed in a topical cream or injectable therapeutic that would speed human healing.Cancer insightsAnother fascinating characteristic of reindeer antlers is the rate at which they can grow.Male and female reindeer shed their antlers each winter and grow a new, identical set over the spring and summer, at incredible rates of up to two centimetres per day.‘The antlers grow back in the same path every year, so there’s an inherent memory as to how it’s meant to grow,’ says Calgary researcher Jeff Biernaskie. (Dave Will/CBC)“This is faster than any tumour. This is faster than any other tissue, as far as I know, in the animal kingdom that can grow that quickly, other than potentially in the embryo,” Biernaskie said.He said it was “fascinating” that such rapid growth could occur without generating any tumours.Biernaskie hopes that by studying how those reindeer cells co-ordinate with one another, doctors may gain a better understanding of how and why cell growth may become cancerous.While elk also grow new antlers, only the males are capable of doing so. The fact that female reindeer are able to grow new antlers leads Biernaskie to belive that it isn’t a hormonal regulation, but a cellular mechanism, that facilitates this remarkable growth.He hopes to publish the findings of his research early in the new year.",

I’m Cherish Sharmaine Interior. I’ve been reading some posts about me. Some pages have also been created that pretends to be mine but I would like to speak out. First of all, I am sorry. It was just caused by my short temper. I have a problem on anger management and please understand my situation. Second of all, I am not always like this. My friends and relatives know the real me. I deeply regret what happened. I got the name of the driver and I’m more than willing to reach out to him. Third, that fb page under my name is not mine. I won’t post photos of myself and my bf especially that we are hated by the social media public today. That page is created to incite more hate on me and my bf. It just needs your likes and hate. This is the reason why I needed to deactivate my main Facebook account and use my spare account to protect my loved ones since they have their infos and photos on my original account. Fourth, please spare my company and my relatives! Call me vile things, assassinate my character, I deserve that. But please spare my company, officemates and relatives.On Sunday, Sharmaine Interior became viral on the internet after she slapped the taxi driver during a road rage incident.Virgilio Doctor, the taxi driver, said that he almost had a high blood pressure after he got physically assaulted by Interior.According to several witnesses, the taxi driver didn’t commit any violation, however Interior still confronted Doktor and assaulted him.Yesterday, he went to the LTFRB to formally file a case against Interior.LTFRB confirmed that the registration of the car with a plate number of ZPD-995 which driven by Interior was already expired.Several netizens also claimed that they encountered the car driven by Interior before and they complained about the aggressive behavior of the driver along the road.Netizens also attacked the company where Interior was allegedly working. They demanded them to fire the road rage suspect for her behavior that could destroy the image of their company.The video was watched by millions of netizens worldwide and gained thousands of hate comments against Interior.Source 1:Source 2 NEWS5:Commentscomments",

I think DepEd should ban the book and not allow any people, including a sitting politician to use students for their personal motives”, Hughes added.Prof. Hughes taught Sociology at University of the Philippines – Diliman, from 1969 to 1973, and had been a member of MMST Board of Trustees shortly from 1973 to 1974 during the height of Marcos’ administration.“The Duterte administration should seriously look into this. Hontiveros could face multiple charges like rebellion, abuse of authority, and sedition among others if this happens here US, japan, or in other democratic European countries.This is just unacceptable. Marcos Jr’s highly promising election result shows that the Filipino people does not need someone like Hontiveros to lecture them about Martial law.

Among these three phases, for the Bato, the graduation part is the hardest to achieve.In an interview with the reporters, Bato expressed how proud he was for Rock for surviving months of tough training both physically and mentally. He said, “I told my son I’m very proud of him.”In 2016, the unico hijo of the PNP Chief confessed his desire to follow his father’s footsteps. He initially took up Business Administration at Philippine Women’s College, but he realized soon enough that becoming a policeman was his calling. He then added that growing up in a family of public servants influenced him greatly with his decision.“Gusto jud nako kay nidako naman ko sa mga pulis so kabalo na pud ko sa ilang kinabuhi. (I wanted [to become a policeman] because I grew up with cops in the family and I knew what they have been through.).”Rock also explained that his father did not force him to become one. Instead, the PNP Chief advised him to enjoy his life.“Dili nako gusto buhaton para sa iyaha, gusto nako ni buhaton kay love nako ang akong pamilya, mga PNP, mura nakog pamilya sa ilaha ug tibuok Pilipino gyud, ug ang Presidente pud, mahal jud nako ang Presidente. (I am not doing this for him, but for my love for my family, the PNP, my fellow Filipino people and the President.).”",

    "body": "Defending CocoyThe ProPinoy ConnectionWho is Niña Terol?ProPinoy co-founder Niña TerolTP’s TakeawaysI have shown in the previous article that Dayao has sufficient technical know-how to set up the websites, but he doesn't have the communication skills to complete the formula... ...and Terol, Dayao's close associate, can provide that.DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:Senator Cynthia Villar, I think I'm on to something.In last week’s “ #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here’s the guy you’re looking for ”, I explained how several opposition-aligned websites share a common webmaster: Edward Angelo “Cocoy” Dayao, practically uncovering a massive anti-administration propaganda machine.In that article, I looked into the Google Adsense advertisements served in these sites and compared them to the advertisements served in websites known to be owned or controlled by Dayao.That is, I showed that Dayao’s Propinoy.net uses the same Google Adsense Account as SilentNoMorePH, MadamClaudiaAko among others.Moreover, I showed that Dayao’s PinoyAkoBlog uses the same Google Adsense Account as ChangeScamming, BackroomPolitics among other.And now, what?As the article went viral, several opposition bloggers have come to the rescue, arguing that Dayao is just a domain reseller who has nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of these websites.But I beg to disagree.Domain resellers do not inject their own advertisement codes in the domains that they sell. Moreover, the fact that Dayao earns money from those websites on a continuous basis is sufficient proof of Dayao’s complicity in their operations.Besides, why would a website owner let go of website revenue, no matter how small? Adsense can be set up to do automatic bank deposits, so why would a website owner ignore such a revenue stream that basically doesn’t require a lot of maintenance?Moreover, for the sake of argument, isn’t it too coincidental that all of these sites were sourced from the same person?Assuming for the sake of argument that the anti-administration websites are operated by independent entitites, it’s likely the somebody must have referred those entities to Dayao.Well, Dayao owns the single-proprietorship IT consulting company “Lab Rats Technica” [ SHC ] and according to Lab Rats’ website, Cocoy created the website for the Office of Senator Kiko Pangilinan [ LabRats ].But is that the only connection? Sounds pretty thin to me.And that, my friends, is what I’ll explore further in this post.I myself do not believe that Cocoy generates content for all these sites on his own: there’s so many, it’s humanly impossible. Thus, I felt that the next logical step is to do some online sleuthing to check for other potential conspirators, i.e. other potential suspects.The first clue came when I stumbled upon a 21 May 2013 post in Senator Bam Aquino’s official facebook page, which features a photo showing Bam shaking hands with a jeepney driver and with the accompanying caption:“What’s interesting to note here is how Aquino ran a well-rounded campaign. He worked on the ground, and he worked online and offline to deliver the message” ~Cocoy DayaoFollowing the Dayao quote that Aquino used is a backlink to one of Dayao’s ProPinoy articles, as shown below:Now, the photo in itself is insufficient proof, but it does raise reasonable suspicion, so I dug even deeper, and I found an interesting connection. Recall that that the infamous SilentNoMorePH and ProPinoy share the same webmaster, Cocoy Dayao, and that Dayao calls himself the “chairman and editor-in-chief” of ProPinoy.Interestingly, ProPinoy was co-founded by Cocoy Dayao and a certain “Niña Terol”.Let me repeat: we have shown in last week’s article that whoever is behind ProPinoy is also behind SilentNoMorePH and so far, we know that Cocoy is it’s chairman and editor-in-chief.Now, according to her CNN author bio, Terol is a co-founder of deputy editor of Pro-Pinoy [ CNN ]. More specifically, according to her personal blog, she is the President and Deputy Editor of ProPinoy [ Terol ].But wait, there’s more! I checked Niña Terol’s [ LinkedIn Account ] and if Terol somehow decides to take it down, you can find a saved PDF printout by clicking here Looking at Terol’s past jobs per her LinkedIn profile, we see that she was:Current LP senators who also ran for senator in 2010 are Risa Hontiveros and Franklin Drilon. It's also interesting to note that embattled Comelec chair Andy Bautista's brother Martin also ran under LP's 2010 ticket.A nonprofit that is “dedicated to the full realization of People Power in the national life and in the international arena [ PPI FB ]”. Sitting as Chairman is Jim Paredes.Terol said she “heads overall communications and new media operations for the senatorial campaign of Benigno Bam Aquino of the Liberal Party of the Philippines. Manages messaging and issues management, news media and digital operations.”Terol said her “high-level tasks include communications planning and execution, messaging and branding, networking, (and) liaising”, among others.She “headed overall communications, messaging, and digital operations”.Bam Aquino was president of TAYO Foundation from 2009 to 2013 [ Senate ]. Today, the Office of Sen. Bam Aquino still partners with TAYO foundation [ TAYO ].I don't know but isn't the link too obvious? It was practically LP, especially Bam and Kiko, who built her career. She worked as Kiko's New Media (READ: Social Media) head for FOUR YEARS for crying out loud!Terol, with Dayao, co-founded ProPinoy.net, the sister website of SilentNoMorePH and Madam Claudia and so far, this is how I see it:But Terol is not just any other social media marketing specialist. She is someone whose skills were honed during her lengthy stint as a \"New Media Head\" for Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan and the rest of the Liberal Party.Should Sen. Sotto also ask NBI Cybercrime Division to investigate Terol?Yes, he should. ASAP.There are still a lot of questions that must be answered to uncover this whole mess but one thing's for sure: Cocoy Dayao is one crappy web security consultant. [ ",

    "body": "In a backwards society where body shaming is considered as an acceptable behavior, where beauty is determined by high-end magazines, curated Instagram personalities, and celebrities who look like they were born perfect, it is very rare to find someone who is not afraid to show her flaws. Instead, she embraces them and shows everyone that “Hey, it’s okay not to be perfect. Nobody is.” (Except maybe Barbie dolls.)Especially when this person is a lot of people’s definition of “perfect”.This is exactly what Maine Mendoza, the star of the Bench Under The Stars 30th Anniversary Fashion Show, showed the world. After her catwalk, a lot of netizens and celebrities praised her for her toned physique. Indeed, she looked stunning in her terno cropped top and skirt, which bared her lean and toned abs. However, after seeing several tweets and posts from fans and news sites praising her for her abs, she fearlessly replied to them in her signature funny way that she is, indeed, not perfect.First, she thanked her fanswho supported her during the show, saying it was surreal. And then she apologized for her “malaking tiyan.”A lot of people might probably consider this as false humility, or fishing for compliments even, but when she tweeted a photo of her in the same outfit backstage, saying her tummy looked like a ‘peanut butter’ sandwich, it is fairly easy to tell that she is not lying or looking for validation. And that is what makes her so relatable.She embodies grace and elegance, yet she does not intimidate. She is stunningly beautiful, yet she is not unreachable. And that is where her charm lies. That is what makes her so likeable. That is what makes Maine so loveable.When people tag her as someone so perfect, she shows them her ‘real’ side – the side which has flaws, the side which has abs during a fashion show but has a ‘peanut butter’ tummy backstage, the side which is not afraid to tell people that it’s okay not to be perfect.And when she shows people her imperfections so willingly? That is when her real beauty shines beyond her “malaking tiyan”. In Maine’s words, #wapakels!You go, girl!What do you think of Maine Mendoza’s tweets? Do you admire her for her fearlessness? Let us and other netizens know by commenting below!",

The company said that $30,950,010-worth of USDT was taken from its core treasury wallet “through malicious action by an external attacker.”In response Tether said it has flagged the tokens — meaning that it will track them and prevent the holder from exchanging them through its service — and that it is working to recover them.For partners, the back-end wallet service has been suspended. Tether said it will investigate the incident while it rolls out an update to Omni Core — its software for partners — that will prevent the stolen coins from recirculating into its ecosystem by essentially locking them into the alleged hacker’s wallet.One of the partners that uses Tether is crypto exchange Bitfinex, which itself lost 119,756 bitcoin — then worth $72 million but valued at over $950 million today — in a hack over a year ago.As Coindesk reports, the incident is sure to throw up more questions about the relationship between Tether and the secretive exchange Bitfinex. The duo are rumored to share owners, and have been accused of leaning on each other to manipulate the market. Already, there are theories circulating that suggest this new attack could be an inside job.Bitcoin’s value took a dent when the news came out, but it quickly recovered. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s value stood at $8,126.71, down 1.35 percent over 24 hours, according to Coindesk.",

(Photo courtesy: PNP San Miguel) Bago nito ay lumapit sa San Miguel PNP ang mga kaanak ni Garcia para isumbong ang pagdukot sa kanya ng ilang armadong lalaki kahapon ng ala una ng madaling araw.

Well, for his part, 86-year-old Clare McIntosh wasn’t sure what to make of it when the new owner of a vintage 1920s theater in Iowa informed him his wallet, the one he lost in 1944, has been found under the theater’s 90-year-old floorboards.Larry Sloan purchased The Talent Factory theater in Nevada, Iowa, because he was fascinated by how rich the old 1920s theater was in terms of historical value.The Talent Factory “was built in the ’20s. So many generations of people that saw their first movie here,” Sloan told KCCI. In his excitement, Sloan began renovating the theater at once. Upon lifting the almost-century-old floorboards, Sloan’s enthusiasm was rewarded by a little piece of long-lost history.Right there, he recovered a child’s wallet that had quite the story to tell, as was evidenced by the 1944 pocket calendar Sloan found inside. Along with the calendar, he found a boy scout card, some WWII ration stamps, and a handwritten I.D. which identified the wallet’s owner as a Clare McIntosh.Incidentally, before becoming the new owner of the 1920s theater, Sloan worked as an investigator. He made good use of his skills in order to track McIntosh down, to return the wallet he lost when he was 13.The 86-year-old Clare McIntosh was skeptical at first upon receiving a call from Sloan, thinking the latter was playing a prank on him. However, he soon realized the man was telling the truth and made the trip to Talent Factory to retrieve his long-lost wallet.Of course, McIntosh had already forgotten about the wallet he lost 71 years ago but said he is surely going to “cherish” the wallet now along with the memories it has held safe for the past 7 decades.Watch this amazing historical discovery in the following video!Congratulations on finding your wallet, McIntosh!Was there something you lost a while back that you would like find? What is it and why is it important to you? If you would McIntosh, how would you feel about Sloan giving back something you lost that long ago?

The new projects will be able to generate 600 megawatts of power, enough to supply 255,000 homes. The companies will be eligible for some so-far-undisclosed subsidies from the province.The low cost should reduce the risk renewable energy development has carried in the past, said Shaffer, who once worked as trading director for TransAlta.He now works as a fellow-in-residence with the C.D. Howe Institute, where he writes about the economics of energy. On Thursday, he discussed the deal with Calgary Eyeopener executive producer and guest host Jennifer Keene.Q: How does that compare to jurisdictions where they have quite a bit of clean energy like Ontario?A: I think that’s one of the fears a lot of people have, to start down this path of increasing the amount of green energy you have in Alberta. Hear a lot of stories coming out of Ontario, what it’s done to their home energy prices.Blake Shaffer, a former trading director with TransAlta, is a fellow with the C.D. Howe Institute who writes on energy issues. (CD Howe Institute)In Ontario, when they first got going — rather than doing what Alberta did, which is go forth with a competitive auction, get people to compete on price — they basically stuck a price list at their window saying, “I will pay this for wind, I will pay this for solar.”They were paying in the extreme as much as $800 per MWh for some small scale solar. Wind was around $100 to $150 per MWh versus this $37.When energy nerds like myself are getting all excited about this price, it truly is a pretty remarkable price we got for wind here yesterday.Q: This was an auction. They were looking for contractors to bid and they went with three wind companies but no solar companies. Do you know why that is?A: The design of this auction was effectively to elicit the lowest cost, and right now the lowest cost is going to be wind power in this province. But an important caveat on that is, if we’re looking for a place to critique yesterday’s auction, low cost doesn’t always necessarily mean we’re getting the best value.Solar, because it costs a little bit more to generate, it didn’t win this auction.It produces power in the middle of the day, you know, when the sun’s shining. Whereas wind’s profile is a bit more shifted towards the night time when power’s a little less valuable.In some cases, we might prefer to actually pay a little bit more to get solar’s energy profile, which is better. But this auction doesn’t do that.I just wrote a piece that came out this morning for the C.D. Howe Institute, where I’m a fellow, where I argue we should be celebrating this price but in the future we need to tweak our auction design to recognize both low cost as well as the value.Because what we really want is the best net benefit between value and cost, not simply low cost.Q: We’ve heard this before that the knock on wind power is that wind doesn’t always blow. It’s just not always reliable. So will there have to be backup systems in place for all of these wind turbines and the energy that they intend to produce?A: That’s certainly true. The low price doesn’t negate the fact that wind is a variable resource. We get the power when the wind blows, not necessarily when we want it.I think the old knock on renewables was that it was both variable and high cost. Now at least we’ve knocked that second part of it away.It’s still variable but what we’re getting is a really cheap source of raw energy. So at these low prices, we can afford to pay for different types of things that can allow us to integrate wind when it blows.What I mean by that is find a way to store it, to shape it into the hours that we want, or simply to have backup, like you say, with other types of supply.​There’s many ways to do that. You could think of having gas plants in backup, is one method, but that might be a costly one in the long run to have a 100 per cent type backup system.Other methods are storage, so either physical storage through pumped hydro or chemical storage with batteries, which is probably the direction we’re headed here in the future.The other one is increasing our ability to move power back and forth between other regions, like B.C., where they have large hydro reservoirs that can store power when say Alberta’s wind is abundant. We can ship it over there and bring power back in times of needThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.With files from Lisa Robinson and the Calgary Eyeopener",

Rizalina Seachon-Lañete and alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim Napoles.Lañete is one of the lawmakers accused in the P10 billion pork barrel scam. She is expected to post bail today, and may be released from Camp Bagong Diwa.The Sandiganbayan 4th Division allowed Napoles and Lañete to post P500,000 bail each for temporary liberty while their plunder case is being heard.Lañete was earlier indicted by the Office of the Ombudsman for allegedly pocketing P112.9 million from her pork barrel allocation while she was a member of the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2010.Lañete and Napoles both pleaded not guilty to the plunder and graft cases.Laeñete will still run for reelection in the May 2016 elections despite the Ombudsman’s order to dismiss her from service after finding sufficient evidence over her purported misuse of pork barrel funds.The Palace “noted” the Sandiganbayan division’s ruling, but it said that Napoles cannot go out of jail because she was convicted for illegally detaining her former aide, pork barrel whistleblower Benhur Luy, and has pending cases before the other divisions of the anti-graft court.“We note the resolution of the Sandiganbayan in granting bail to Ms. Napoles, being a separate branch of government under the Judiciary. However, it should be emphasized that Ms. Napoles was convicted in April 2015 by the Makati RTC for serious illegal detention. Accordingly, she cannot be released due to such conviction and the several other cases for plunder pending against her,” said Palace Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr.(c) http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/04/13/16/sandigan-grants-bail-to-napoles-laeteCommentscomments",

This time, she shared details about her past relationship with none other than the Mayor of Quezon City, Herbert Bautista.In a recent interview with People Asia Magazine, the host-actress confessed that one of the lowest moments of her life was when her former flame Herbert canceled their wedding.Loading...“Herbert Bautista canceled our wedding. One of the lowest moments of my life. I still remember the date, April 8, 2014, inatrasan ako sa kasal ni Herbert. Over the phone. I was in Bellevue Hotel in Alabang because we were celebrating the (advanced) seventh birthday of Bimbi. It did not hit me at first because we were having a party.”Kris Aquino added that Herbert Bautista’s marriage proposal was issued a month before he canceled the wedding, though she opted not to divulge the reason why the QC Mayor decided not to push through with their nuptials. In January 2017, Herbert proposed to her once again with a D-color, heart-shaped diamond ring while they were in Rome. Kris recounted Herbert’s words that time:“Ang tagal kong utang ito sa ‘yo. So, puwede bang makabawi ngayon?”Kris accepted the ring, only to give it back the following day.“I returned it the next day because I said that we will always have responsibilities that came before he and I meet. And as long as our children are not done yet with their studies, I don’t think we have the freedom to be able to choose happiness. I returned the ring not because gusto kong iparamdam sa kanya kung anong pinaramdam niya sa akin three years before that. It was because nagising na ko. I just realized that a person like him and a person like me can’t be together because (my mom said this already) in a home there can only be one star. And I think, a union like that would require me to no longer be me. And I still want to be me.”“I admire him so much because he was willing to be the knight in shining armor and he came back when I was already nobody. He came back when I had no network, I had no power, we had no base. Dun ako humanga sa kanya.”When asked how long she and Herbert were together, Kris said that they never really had a relationship at all.“We don’t even have a relationship at all. I don’t count it anymore because it was always nauudlot. I told him, ‘Tayo yung perfect na what-could-have-been so let’s just leave it there.’ I really appreciated it that he came back to my life when I was a nobody.”Kris Aquino is set to grace the cover page of People Magazine Asia for their December 2017- January 2018 issue.Loading...Commentscomments",

    "body": "President Duterte yesterday hit back at Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, accusing the lawmaker of having an affair with former Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) executive director Julia Bacay-Abad.The President also belittled the senator’s manhood and challenged him to a gun duel.“Balita ko isa lang ‘yang b**** mo. Congenital. Kayabang mo. Maglaban kaya sa akin ng barilan? Ay sus. Ipagyabang mo ‘yang bunganga mo (I heard you have only one testicle. You’re a braggart. Why don’t you fight me in a gun duel? You can brag about your mouth),” he said.He said Trillanes started his black propaganda during the campaign last year in a bid to derail his presidential bid – “but to no avail.”“Ayan, patay na. Magkakaso-kaso sila ngayon (Now it’s dead. They will have many charges now),” he added.Duterte said Trillanes got information from Abad, the same purported bank details given by the senator to Deputy Ombudsman Rodolfo Elman and Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Carandang, who were tasked to probe the bank deposits of Duterte and his family.“You cannot use it as evidence in court because ninakaw ninyo ‘yan ni Abad (you and Abad stole it). Binigay niya kay Trillanes, binigay ni Trillanes kay Elman, the Ombudsman for Mindanao because I’m a resident there in Mindanao (She gave the documents to Trillanes, Trillanes gave it to Elman), then gave it to Morales. Tapos naghuhugas na ng kamay sila ngayon pati si Elman (Now they are washing their hands, including Elman),” he said.“Carandang has a resolution in my case. It is attached on the record. It was ignored,” he added.Duterte went a bit further, accusing Trillanes of having an affair with Abad.“She is the mistress of Trillanes,” he said, adding that he could not allow the senator to ruin the country and his presidency.“It’s Trillanes who will bring this government or this country down to the dogs. Nanguna ang g***. Patapang-tapangan. Sabi niya, ‘O…’ Kaya unahin ko nga siya. P***** i** (He’s leading in being brave so I will take him first),” Duterte said.Impeach themIn a hastily called press conference, Duterte virtually gave the go-ahead to his allies at the House of Representatives to proceed with the impeachment cases against Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales and Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.Duterte made the statement after Morales maintained that she would not abandon her constitutional duty to investigate irregularities in the government, including the President. He accused Morales of conspiring with political forces to remove him from office.“We will file an impeachment case against her and I would tend to believe that she was part of the conspiracy, on the fabricated papers,” he said, referring to the bank documents purportedly used by Trillanes in his graft complaint against him.“I said, in the end, to their sorrow, they would discover that there’s no such thing as that amount.”Duterte said he is ready to present before Congress to dispute the claims but Sereno and Morales should also go with him.The President also denied knowing Daniel “Snooky” Cruz, his alleged source of information on Trillanes’ supposed offshore bank accounts, saying the only Snooky he knows are the actress and the comic strip character.The President was referring to actress Snooky Serna and Snoopy, the beagle in the comic strip “Peanuts.”He also denied spending huge sums to get information about Trillanes’ bank accounts.“I will not spend a single centavo for him. He is not worth even one peso to me,” Duterte said.",

    "body": "There was a time when getting an attractive job offer would certainly excite me and stroke my ego for a few days. But now I find myself studying impact and consequence more than compensation and prestige. I need the money, I want the money, but we must all prioritize our self-respect.It’s a strange place in life but having gone through a few bad choices and regrettable employment, I know there is wisdom in being deliberate and analytical rather than jumping in just because people say “opportunity does not knock twice.” December is traditionally the time of the year when employees and executives alike are sitting it out, waiting for the 13th month pay and performance bonus to drop on their lap before they send in their resignation, say “Sayonara” and walk off to a new job opportunity. Be careful what you wish for.Yesterday, I found myself across a table from a very attractive woman who had an even more attractive offer: To go back to TV, doing what I love to do and do best: doing an all news talk show. There was a time when the talk and negotiations would be all over in 30 minutes, but yesterday was different. We spent three hours going over the idea, broadcast management history as well as the history of failed TV programs and executives. The more I learned about the project and the people behind it, the more I got excited because I tend to take ownership of such ideas.The funny part was that, the more I got excited, the more I found reason to be distant, objective and intensely analytical. It is a pleasant paradox that comes with age. Something new or different always pricks curiosity and imagination but the unknown also forces us to draw deep from experience and acquired knowledge. My first thought was: I have maybe 20 years left and possibly 10 productive working years. Do I want to “Chance it” by signing up for the show without considering the viability and longevity of the Channel knowing the job will eat up at least one or two years of my limited shelf life?We all assume everything will be great and avoid the possibility of failure regardless if it’s my fault or someone else’s. But what if we fail, am I ok or comfortable with the possibility that the show flops and that becomes my final signature as far as being on TV is concerned? If you’re a true professional, it can never be just another project or racket. It is your work and real or electronic, your signature goes to it and becomes part of your personal history. Don’t grab things just because it doesn’t happen everyday or because it’s a “dream job” – I know many senior executives who have been living in a daily nightmare because they did not know how to say no or wanted to prove themselves to their loss.There is a reason why the book “The Peter Principle” became a best seller. We all want opportunities, promotion and fame. But if it’s not your expertise, or in my case when the field or industry is now played under new rules, technology or players, the chances of a slow or bad start and an ugly finish are just as high as becoming a season’s hit.Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1Do you have any idea who you will be working for and what their motivation, vision or desperation is all about? A few years back, I wrote a column where I questioned why CEOs and CFOs religiously conduct due diligence on whatever business or company they are buying, but they never conduct due diligence studies on the executives who will be running those companies. On one job, I landed as a newbie, I encountered a CEO who habitually screamed, cursed and threw bundles of paper work at his executives and employees. Then he would say if you disagree with what I do, send in your resignation. Four months into the job, he got his wish, all 22 of us managers walked out.Not all bosses are horror stories. There are bosses who have been diminished by corporate in fighting, favoritism or simply the wrong fit for a business unit. People are never happy when I start asking questions about leaders and bosses because they find it disrespectful or antagonistic. Sorry but I am not particularly excited about being in a team that’s doomed to fail or being sent out to battle with their hands tied behind their back! Do your own Due Diligence.Just in case you’re thinking that I’m wimping out, no! Many Filipinos especially young people are never trained to study “the ship,” “the crew” and the mission before signing up. So when the ship leaves port and runs low on funds, can’t give out promotions or salary increases, or people realize that there is no horizon as far as their job or career go, people start bailing out at the next stop or first opportunity.I’ve always been a Mad Man and regularly challenge or question the system or leaders not to antagonize, but to better understand the plan, direction, as well as my role and expected contribution. Leaders who are sure of their mission and vision should never be disturbed or bothered when people question or challenge their idea. Work that is planned well and done well will always withstand challenge. The beautiful lady across the table commented that I can be scary when I do so. What’s scary is walking up a building using the stairs going up floor-by-floor, reaching the top and then discovering you’re in the wrong address. What’s even scarier is committing to help a leader, never questioning the battle plan, being content to perform based on your job description and ending up walking beside him toward the cliff of failure and professional demise.* * *Email: utalk2ctalk@gmail.com",

In the last part of the article, I lamented, “To verify Oplan Lambat-Sibat’s ‘scientific reports’, we need raw, unadulterated data that cover months’ worth of crime reports. Perhaps, that’s something that only (Former DILG Sec.) Mar Roxas knows.”Since god-knows-when, secrecy and inaccessibility of government information has been a source of frustration for investigative bloggers like me. So just imagine my delight when then-Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo filed a powerful Freedom of Information Bill, which would afford any citizen access to government records. Unfortunately, fortitude is not one of Leni’s virtues, as she [ TP: crippled her own bill to satisfy her Liberal Party overlords ], led by then-President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino.With Freedom of Information (FoI), regular citizens can request for government documents, allowing them to learn more deeply about how the government works. Unfortunately, FoI has been stuck in the legislature since time immemorial, and despite President Rodrigo Duterte’s May 2016 win, the best he can do is certify the bill as urgent, but the buck stops at the Senate and the Lower House.But that didn’t stop the current administration to finding a way to get around it.",

The healthy exchange of opposing views is crucial in a democracy,” Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a Liberal Party (LP) member, said.Zero allocations are projected to punish and silence opposition legislators even as it is their constituencies who are deprived of the benefits of infrastructure development,” Albay Representative Edcel Lagman said in a seperate statement.Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Representative Villarin condemned President Rodrigo Duterte for his ‘revenge’ against the opposition who criticized his policies including the war against illegal drugs.He said that President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent moves ‘speak much about the dictatorial tendencies of this administration,’.Caloocan Representative Egay Erice said that he would fight until the ‘last drop’ of his blood to protect the people who will be affected by the budget cut.“I will fight to the last drop of my blood before the courts and on the streets if necessary to protect the 8 million Filipinos who will be benefitting from the projects,” he said in a statement.Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno clarified that the lawmakers will not get zero budgets, however the supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte will given more funds for their projects.“If you’re with us then you get something. If you’re not with us then you don’t get something… Allies will get more. More projects,” Diokno saidPresident Rodrigo Duterte is not yet giving any comments on the slash budget for the opposition members.It’s not the first time that the congress used the ‘zero budget’ against the critics of the government.Several months ago, Commission on Human Rights were nearly given a zero budget by the congress, however it was reversed after receiving criticisms from the public.",

Sinabi ni Khan na ang advisory council nito ay binubuo ng “individuals of international reputation for extraordinary leadership in addressing rule of law, justice, and development issues.”Bukod kay Gates, ang council members ay kinabibilangan nina dating Ireland President Mary Robinson; dating Senegal President Abdou Diouf; Abdel-Latif Al-Hamad, chairman ng Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development; Albie Sachs, dating justice ng Constitutional Court of South Africa; at dating U.S. ambassador Thomas Pickering.“I am honored yet humbled to receive the invitation from IDLO. It challenges me to place my lifetime career as a lawyer and legislator in a larger frame of service for the pursuit of justice and international development,” sabi ni Santiago.Bago imbitahan sa IDLO Council, si Santiago ang naging unang Pilipino at Asian na nahalal bilang hukom sa International Criminal Court. Isinuko niya ang kanyang puwesto noong 2013 matapos masuring may lung cancer. Nitong Oktubre, inanunsyo ni Santiago na nagapi na niya ang sakit at tatakbong pangulo sa halalan 2016.“If elected in May, and with the consent of IDLO, I expect to serve both as president of the Philippines and member of the International Advisory Council,” sabi ng senador.

Netizens became shocked and furious after seeing this viral video featuring a clear case of police brutality in Brgy. San Jose.The video was shared by the Facebook page Trending kay Babalu, which shows these policemen, identified as PO1 Jose Tandog and PO1 Chito Eniriquez, mercilessly beating two seemingly innocent civilians.According to the video’s caption, the brother of person who shared the video and his friend were apprehended by the policemen without just cause.They were then taken to the barangay hall because they could not pay for a ticket. It was there that both young men suffered through a recorded instance of police brutality. Both men were supposedly intimidated using an arnis stick and a loaded gun being pointed at the both of them.Luckily the man identified as Marvin was able to record the incident as it happened. Read the whole caption here:In the beginning of the video, a young man can be heard pleading to the officers, saying:“hindi ako nagmamalaki sa inyo sir!” That’s when the police officer with the arnis stick began swearing at him.Then the two men had asked if they had any “rules and regulations” (referring to their maltreatment) in the barangay. Both officers mockingly responded with “ang dami niyong alam!” and “marami kayong alam noh?”Afterwards, the police officer with the stick was seen taking out a pair of handcuffs as he approached one of the young men. The man asked not to be handcuffed because there was no case being filed against them.It was at that point that the stick-wielding policeman threatened to strike the man with the stick.“Gusto mo?!” the officer asked.The young man replied, “ok lang, walang problema”.That’s when the police officer first struck the man on what appeared to be his stomach and then right on his face. It was at that point that the police officer began repeatedly beating them and cursing at them. The violent police officer screamed:“Sige laban! P*tang ina! Puputukan ko kayo!”Watch the brutal evidence of police brutality here:Warning! The following video may contain graphic scenes. Viewer discretion is strongly advised.POLICE BRUTALITY SA BRGY. SAN JOSEHindi na po dapat ako magpopost Pero SOBRA na po talaga ang ginagawa ninyong pananakit, pangaabuso, pananakot. Kagabi hinuli ni JOSE TANDOG at CHITO ENRIQUEZ, parehong PO1 ang aking kapatid na si Marvin Calda at kumpare nyang si Mac2 Villanueva kahit walang nagawang kamalian. Dinala sila sa Brgy dahil wala silang dalang pangticket at doon naganap ang malahayop na pananakit at pagbunot at pagtutok ng baril. Ma buti nlng at mabilis na naisip ni Marvin na mavideohan ang mga pangyayari. Nasaan si Ron2 at kanyang mga tanod? Bakit wala kayong naging aksyon. Pasensya npo sir Ubina, yung pakiusap mo na huwag ipost ang pangyayari ay Hindi ko po mapagbibigyan. Martial law na ba sa atin? Diba mission ng mga police to \"serve and protect\"? May karapatan kami ipaglalaban namin. Lalaban po kami, Hindi ko palalampasin ang pangaabuso ninyo . Sa mga inabuso at sinaktan ng mga police sa ating barangay, hinihikayat ko kayong magsalita at magreklamo.

Killer? Really a killer. Who would not be a killer? So is it wrong to say now , ‘Do not destroy my country because I will destroy you?’ Destroying my country is destroying my countrymen. It’s people we’re talking of,” he saidThe President said he was not bothered by the accusation that he ordered the killings, during the 84th anniversary celebration of the Department of Labor and Employment.He said that he needs to fulfill his promise to eradicate the drug trade in the country, and that he has no choice but to annihilate the drug problem, even it puts lives on those involved in the drug trade at risk.“What I just wanted is do not destroy the country because I will destroy you. I will kill you. Why would you get involved (in illegal drugs)? You really want to die. If you want to die, I will do it for you,” the Chief Executive added.On December 7, Duterte said that he might have ordered the killings.“I ordered their killing? Maybe yes,maybe no. Do not go into a guessing game for you might guess it right and I would be sorry for it,” said Duterte during the first Kapampangan Food Festival held in Pampanga.The war against drugs has been the primary platform, and campaign promise of Duterte, and it has also marked his administration.The deaths in the drug war have garnered massive media attention, even in the international scheme.Several groups and NGO’s have gone against the methods, yet Duterte said that he won’t listen to the appeals.“Drugs, I will not accept it. I have been persistently criticized by human rights (groups). I’m tired of it. You’re just wasting your saliva,” Duterte said.He said that he will fulfill his promise no matter the situation.“There will be no drugs. I don’t care if I lose my job, the presidency, or if I get killed. I promised the Filipino people during the campaign and I will do it whether you like it or not. Sorry but I don’t care about your opinion about me,” he added.Source: sunstar.com.phCommentscomments",

And I told (Defense Secretary Delfin) Lorenzana na paghatian ninyo na lalo na ‘yung sniper. Very beautiful. You’ll get it in a matter of days,” said Duterte in a speech in Davao City Thursday. Duterte is expecting anohter batch of sniper rifles from China in September.Duterte ordered Special Assistant to the President Bong Go to rush the ballistic examinations of the sniper rifles because couldn’t wait to deploy these as soon as possible to his men on the field in Marawi.“I hope that you can assemble about one battalion of snipers para — mahusay kung marami tayong snipers. They are also sniping at us and they have the beautiful guns, they have the Barretts,” said Duterte referring to the US Military issued Barret M107semi-automatic sniper rifle used by Maute snipers in Marawi City.“Well, it’s a deadly firearm, it can reach you almost one kilometer away. But may panlaban naman tayo. Marami man rin tayong Barrett. And with additional arms, I think we will find it easy really to operate,” said Duterte.After the Marawi war, Duterte is planning to investigate how these Barrettes issued by the Department of National Defense found their way into the hands of the enemy. He said one of the reasons why the Marawi war has lasted this long was because of the well-positioned snipers of Maute.“Taas kasi sila eh. So tayo, uphill. Nakaposisyon na ‘yung snipers nila, ‘yung mga Barrett. So practically we ha — we were in open country. So, every building was occupied with one or two… So, naparami ‘yung casualties natin,” said Duterte.",

Aside from their star-studded guest list, the wedding was actually not announced to the local media which left people guessing when and where their wedding will be. Although there were rumors about their special day, the couple never made any official announcement to keep the ceremony as private as possible. And because the media did not have any access to the wedding and the reception, fans and supporters of the celebrity couple had to rely instead on Instagram posts uploaded by the guests.One particular event in the reception went viral on social media recently. In the footage, the groom was shown entertaining the guests at his wedding when he performed a strip show for his wife, Anne. After exchanging their vows and “I do’s,” the newlyweds and their guests headed to Walter Peak Station for the wedding party.The groom blithely offered a “Magic Mike” number for the bride. He started to remove his tie and unbuttoned his polo then danced to the tune of Ginuwine’s “Pony” which was popularized by Channing Tatum in “Magic Mike”. The guests cheered for him while Anne was seated and couldn’t contain her laughter.He was given a red rose which he placed against his lips to position his self on Anne’s lap and passed the flower through a sweet and gentle kiss. Erwan hiked up her gown for him to get the wedding garter. It is quite an old tradition which symbolizes the newlyweds consummating their marriage.The high-profile celebrity couple celebrated their wedding in front of their family and closest friends in New Zealand after a year of being engaged. The two have been in a relationship for about seven years. They both became emotional during the ceremony, probably because of the thought that they were about to spend the rest of their lives together.Anne’s bridal look was simple yet sophisticated. She wore a wedding gown created by Monique Lhuillier and decided not to go for a full face makeup. Meanwhile, Erwan Heussaff looked dashing in a suit made by his trusted tailor, Mario from Paris.",

Now you might think that the babies were collected from surrogate mothers, but in true fact, it is not. Despite many times that the authorities keep saying that these kind of news are fake, then how do they explain that cases like these appear in reports?This whole incident was brought to light when a journalist, Chan Tau Chou from 101 East took it upon him to run a 4-month investigation to collect evidence and information to expose this trading of babies through online platforms.He stumbled upon a closed group on Facebook that was active in this trading that was mainly run by a bunch of admins who owned fake accounts.[‘We are unable to verify the claims nor the origins of these images.”]",

He says the voter had chosen Republican candidates in every other race.“Simonds’ bubble had an additional slash mark through it,” the letter said.Simonds, a school board member, had initially appeared to lose November’s election by 10 votes.The outcome likely will decide partisan control of the House of Delegates. If Yancey wins, Republicans will hold on to power by one seat, 51-49. If Simonds wins, a rare power-sharing agreement would have to be brokered between Democrats and Republicans.4 House race recountsDemocrats rode a tidal wave powered by unhappiness with Republican President Donald Trump in last month’s elections to erase Republicans’ 66-34 advantageTuesday’s recount was one of four scheduled for House races with extremely tight margins. The 94th District had by far the slimmest vote difference and the biggest chance of flipping.Last week, Republican Del. Tim Hugo held on to his seat in Fairfax County after a recount had little impact on his 100-plus vote lead.Two more recounts are set Wednesday and Thursday. The Democratic challenger leads by 336 votes in the 68th House District in and around Richmond, where ballot counting begins Wednesday.Republican Del. David Yancey, left, successfully challenged an uncounted ballot that he said should have been included in his total. (Jonathon Gruenke/The Daily Press via AP)Ballots will be recounted Thursday in the Fredericksburg area’s 28th District. The Republican candidate there leads by 82 votes. But Democrats already have asked a judge to call for a new election after at least 147 ballots were found to be assigned to the wrong districts.If Democrats and Republicans end up evenly split, the parties may have to compromise just to elect a speaker and assign committee chairmanships. The parties reached a power-sharing agreement when Virginia’s House was last evenly divided 20 years ago. But if no agreement can be reached, prolonged chaos could ensue.",

Share TweetBy Philippine News AgencyThree witnesses to the murder of Kian Delos Santos, the 17-year-old student killed in the Caloocan City anti-drug operations last Aug. 16, are now under Senate custody, Senator Risa Hontiveros said Thursday.Prior to the turn over to Senate custody, Hontiveros along with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) National Center for Legal Aid and Caloocan Bishop Ambo David took custody of the three witnesses — 31-year-old and two minors aged 16 and 13 years old — since Sunday (August 20).“Chairman Lacson also extended the sanctuary of the Senate using his Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs,” Hontiveros told reporters in a press conference after the hearing into Kian’s slay.Hontiveros said that her office has “full coordination” with Lacson as well as Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III.She said her request for an executive session to listen to the testimonies’ of the minor witnesses did not push through because Lacson’s committee was waiting for an authorization letter from one of the witnesses’ mother who works as an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) in Oman.“Minabuti ni Chairman Lacson na bago sila idinig sa executive session ay makuha ang authorization in writing mula sa Nanay (ng isa sa mga testigo),” she said.She added her office has also kept in touch with the witnesses’ parents via text message.The senator said that the siblings of one of the witnesses have also requested to accompany their family member in the Senate.During the hearing, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II insisted that the witnesses should be placed under the government’s witness protection program (WPP) as they could easily be “brainwashed” under Hontiveros’ custody.Hontiveros, however, reiterated that it was up to the witnesses and their families to decide who to secure them.Also during the hearing, Kian’s parents, Saldy and Lorenzana Delos Santos, came face to face with the three police officers accused of killing their son namely; PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz.The three cops refused to answer most of the senators’ questions including “Who killed Kian Delos Santos?” and instead invoked their right against self incrimination.Mr. and Mrs. Delos Santos, meanwhile, took the opportunity to speak to the policemen telling them how painful it was to lose their son who dreamt of becoming a cop like them.Tags: authorization letter, Caloocan City, Hontiveros turns over Kian slay witnesses to Senate, Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Kian Delos Santos, Lacson, Lorenzana Delos Santos, Manila Bulletin, Risa Hontiveros, Senate, Senate Committee on Public Order",

    "body": "Earlier this month, heartbreaking footage of a Chinese prisoner saying goodbye to his young daughter spread like wildfire online. The short video featured a man who cherished his final moments with his family minutes before being executed via lethal injection.According to a report published by the Daily Mail, the Chinese prisoner was identified as Li Shiyuan, a 30-year-old driver from the Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China. Shiyuan was convicted of killing three people in a road mishap back in May of 2015.The crime occurred as he was on a fervent pursuit of three people who had offended him. During the car chase, Shiyuan raced against the trio, whose car then crashed into a ditch. Afterwards, the car burst into flames and killed the three people inside while injuring two others.After being detained, the Chinese prisoner was carted off to a prison in Daqing where he spent almost three years waiting for his execution. Earlier this December, the day finally came for Shiyuan to face his death sentence.During his last moments before facing execution, Shiyuan’s wife and mother were present.To pay his last respects to his beloved family, the Chinese prisoner bowed on all fours, paying no mind to the dirty pavement below him. Even though he was surrounded by and being restricted by the prison guards, the man continued to bow one final time before his family.He also seized his daughter, saying:“Let me hold my daughter.”The Chinese prisoner’s daughter was too young to understand the grave situation surrounding her father. Even though the adults around her were somber due to the heartbreaking farewell, the daughter’s mind was too undeveloped to comprehend her father’s last moments.She might have been told that her daddy will just go to a ‘faraway place,’ blissfully unaware that this was their last moment together.To watch the entire clip, check out this video below.After the paying his respects to his family, Shiyuan was taken to the Daqing Funeral House where the lethal injection was performed on him.Were you also saddened by this farewell? We’d love to hear from you, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts and sentiments with us in the comments section below.

    "body": "Charlie Lee, the former director of engineering at Coinbase, is selling almost all of his holdings in Litecoin (LTC), the cryptocurrency that he founded in 2011.Lee explained in a post on Reddit that he is selling all of his LTC coins — bar a number of physical coins he keeps as collectibles — to avoid the conflict of interest that comes with his influence and position as LTC founder.Thanks to his time at Coinbase and LTC, Lee is regarded as a key influencer in the crypto space and he has accumulated more than 378,000 followers on Twitter, where his handle is @SatoshiLite. While he said he has stayed away from tweeting about LTC prices directly, he acknowledged his tweets have been criticized in some quarters as manipulating the price despite whatever his best interest. Lee readily admits that his position represented a conflict of interest, hence the unload.“Whenever I tweet about Litecoin price or even just good or bads news, I get accused of doing it for personal benefit. Some people even think I short LTC! So in a sense, it is conflict of interest for me to hold LTC and tweet about it because I have so much influence. I have always refrained from buying/selling LTC before or after my major tweets, but this is something only I know. And there will always be a doubt on whether any of my actions were to further my own personal wealth above the success of Litecoin and crypto-currency in general,” Lee wrote.We don’t know how many LTC that Lee held, and had sold, but now he said he is focused on developing the cryptocurrency itself.“This is definitely a weird feeling, but also somehow refreshing. Don’t worry. I’m not quitting Litecoin. I will still spend all my time working on Litecoin. When Litecoin succeeds, I will still be rewarded in lots of different ways, just not directly via ownership of coins. I now believe this is the best way for me to continue to oversee Litecoin’s growth,” he added.Note that Lee’s brother — Bobby — is the founder of China’s largest exchange BTCChina, so this is definitely a powerful crypto family.Like Bitcoin, Ether and others, Litecoin’s value has grown explosively this year.It is the world’s fifth larger cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap.com, with a total ‘market cap’ of more than $2 billion. It’s value, at the time of writing, is $330.14 per coin, up more than 75X from just $4.36 on January 1, 2017.Trading volumes of the coin have also reached unprecedented levels at the tail end of 2017, as indicated in the bottom graph in the chart below.While it has become a vehicle for making money, Litecoin’s original objective was to become the silver to bitcoin’s gold. It was also designed to be easier to mine and cheaper to transact than bitcoin in the hope that these features could make it a cryptocurrency used for trading and real-world use in the future.Note: Jon owns a small amount of cryptocurrency. Enough to gain an understanding, not enough to change a life.",

    "body": "There are “sufficient grounds” to pursue the impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, the House committee on justice ruled yesterday in a vote of 25-2.“The chair hereby declares the complaint sufficient in grounds. There is sufficient ground to impeach… that the complaint alleges sufficient ground for impeachment and we will now move to the next stage, which is the determination of probable cause,” committee chairman Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali said after the voting.He said the committee would begin scrutinizing 27 allegations against Sereno cited by lawyer Lorenzo Gadon in his impeachment complaint.“In determining grounds, we take into consideration the pleadings filed by both parties, if there are sufficient grounds to conduct further hearings,” Umali said.He said lawmakers are still discussing whether to allow Sereno herself to cross-examine witnesses, possibly including six of her colleagues in the 15-man Supreme Court.As he had stated, Umali said Sereno would be given the chance to cross-examine the witnesses but only upon approval of committee members. Sereno’s lawyers earlier said they – not the Chief Justice – would attend any impeachment hearing.“This may be an interesting proceeding that may happen before this committee because, if we allow cross examination by either party, then this will enrich our proceedings,” said Umali.“If we allow (only) the lawyers of Sereno, how can we cross examine the lawyers? How can we ask clarificatory questions from (a lawyer) who is not a party himself or herself?”Sereno spokesperson Josa Deinla insisted that the Chief Justice’s lawyers have the right to cross-examine witnesses. She again argued Gadon’s complaint should be dismissed for being baseless and unfounded.“Sufficiency in grounds means that, necessarily, these should be unlawful or illegal acts and they are of such nature that they would strike at the very core of the essence of government,” she said.“Ibig sabihin, sobrang grabe ang mga acts na ito, dapat mabigat, hindi gaya ng mga paratang ni Gadon (It means, such acts should be severe, heavy, not like the ones alleged by Gadon),” Deinla explained, as she warned the Umali panel against issuing a subpoena to Sereno, the head of a co-equal and independent branch of government.“In our view, she cannot be subpoenaed as she has the right to send lawyers to answer accusations against her in impeachment proceedings,” she pointed out.For opposition lawmakers, the committee vote was apparently meant to railroad the impeachment of Sereno.Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the justice committee “put the cart before the horse when it precipitately and prematurely voted that there are sufficient grounds” to impeach Sereno “based on the pleadings even before any discussion was conducted on the alleged grounds.”He said determination of “sufficiency of the (impeachment) grounds involves discussion and deliberation which were not held prior to the voting.”“My suggestion that the 27 grounds alleged for impeachment must be discussed and voted upon separately was ignored by the committee,” he said.Like Lagman, Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate described the justice committee decision as “precipitate without thorough discussions.”“What is happening here is the impeachment of no less than the Chief Justice, the head of a co-equal branch of government. Let us discuss it properly, thoroughly and extensively. Let us not rush it,” he said.“If this would be the norm in the justice committee, then it appears that the impeachment of the chief justice is now certain. With threats of impeachment proceedings against critics of the present administration, this creates a chilling perception that impeachment is being used as a weapon of retaliation,” he said.Fake newsGabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas said the decision to proceed with Sereno’s impeachment “is yet again another display of the Duterte administration’s political arm-twisting and bullying, in an apparent bid to silence further criticism at the expense of the spirit of democracy and established rules on impeachment proceedings.”“The complaint itself is one big fake news for its hollow allegations. Despite this, the committee proceeded to approve en masse the impeachment complaint without a thorough examination of each ground for impeachment. House members who wanted to express their views were not allowed to speak,” she said.“Such dirty ploy only further exposes Duterte’s desperation to use tyrannical methods against political opposition and will further stoke more dissent against his regime,” she added.Brosas called on the people “to exercise vigilance at a time when all indications increasingly point to a looming Duterte dictatorship – from the rising drug-related killings, postponement of the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections, political harassment of opposition, and activation of vigilante-style witch-hunt against supposed enemies of the state.”She said Duterte’s instruction to lawmaker-allies to have Sereno and Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales impeached “is part of his efforts to shut down checks and balances” and pave the way for a dictatorship “amid growing criticisms on his bloody war on drugs and failed economic policies.”For his part, Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin decried the committee’s barring non-members from sharing their views on moves to impeach Sereno.“It is highly regrettable that we, fellow elected representatives of the people, were not allowed to speak our minds in opposition to the impeachment of the chief justice,” Villarin said.“While we acknowledge that non-committee members cannot cast their votes, tradition allows House members to at least express their opinion, in the spirit of being representatives to a democratic institution,” he said.“We, however, maintain our stand that the entire proceeding further enables a creeping authoritarian rule under a strongman in Malacañang,” he pointed out.At yesterday’s hearing, some justice committee members reminded non-members that they could not participate in deliberations on the impeachment complaint against Sereno.",

Their innocent minds should be spared from the problems of the country and focus on being a good citizen to avoid experiencing such difficulty in the future.That is why Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte’s temper shoot up after she found out that several children were allegedly forced to join an anti-Duterte rally during the National Day of Protest last September 21, 2017.Mayor Sara took to social media to express her anger over this obvious form of child abuse. In her Facebook post, the Presidential daughter said that an informant told her that Lumad children were brought by militant groups to join their protests against President Rodrigo Duterte.Mayor Sara condemns the people behind the alleged transportation of Lumad children in Manila. She wrote, “Magprotesta nalang mo, bata pa inyong himuon force multipliers. Magkasakit mga bata adto dayun sa Lingap ug Dswd. Wa man gani mo budget pangtambal. God bless you. (Magpoprotesta nalang kayo mga bata pa gagamitin niyo. Magkasakit yang mga batang yan,sa dswd agad kayu tatakbo. Wala nga kayong pera pang gamot.)”In a separate Facebook post, the Mayor said instead of joining militants’ protests, Lumad children should be enjoying spending their vacation while studying. She added that these children have the right to decide for themselves to join the rally or not.Energy Fm 107.7 Kalibo also posted photos showing several children in Aklan who are part of the rally against martial law and extrajudicial killings. The kids were seen holding placards made by one of the biggest militant group in the country, the BAYAN-Aklan.Netizen Nhoi Hermo Dela Cruz said: “Anong grupo to? Tama bang isali ang mga bata?

    "body": "What would you do if someone not that close to you asked PHP 400,000 from you? Kapamilya actor Daniel Padilla was surprised when Joross Gamboa called him out of the blue to ask for the said amount.It was actually a prank that was initiated by the radio program MOR 101.9 For Life! They shared the segment on their official YouTube account with the same username, where it has received 162,398 views, 1,000 likes, and around 49 comments as of this writing.Most of the netizens admired how the “Teen King” reacted to Joross’ prank call. How did it go? The host of the program asked Joross to “borrow” PHP 200,000 from Daniel as a joke.“Pero kapag may mga ibang masasabi si DJ na ganyan, baba ko na ah!” Joross exclaimed as he held the phone in front of him. The host urged him to be direct to the point.At that point, Joross dialed Daniel’s number while he covered his mouth in an effort to hide his amused reaction over the whole thing.“Hello?” Daniel answered.“Hello,” Joross Gamboa said. “Ah, ano lang sana… di-diretsuhin na kita… nahihiya ako!” He fell backwards on his chair and covered his mouth as he moved the phone away from him.The host made him do another take as Joross continuously laughed in the background. Then he dialed Daniel again and openly snickered. This made Daniel laugh as well.“Bro, ‘wag ka muna tumawa!” Joross said. “May problema ako dito eh! Eh nag-casino ako…” The “Teen King” laughed over the phone again.“Ba’t ka tumatawa?!” Joross exclaimed as he rubbed his cheek. “Hindi, ito nga, eh, nag-casino ako, nag-bigtime ako na… eh… naano kasi ako, 300K… eh ito-tong its ko ‘yun eh… oo, tatlo nga! Eh may one time, big time. So ngayon, kailangan kong ipakita sa asawa ko na baka puwedeng umutang muna, babalik ko sa’yo! Pahiram muna ako ng 400K.”Then Joross Gamboa realized that he mentioned the wrong amount. “Bro, ha, ‘wag ka munang… nasa radyo tayo, nasa DJ Cha-Cha,” he continued.“Pautang ng 300K!” DJ Cha-Cha said in the background. This made Joross uncontrollably laugh once more.What happened after? Watch the full video below!Here are the comments from the netizens:What do you think about Joross Gamboa pranking Daniel Padilla?

The problem, however, is when the same person gets sick for the second time, because it’s when severe dengue happens.Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairmentHence, a person’s first dengue infection is like a “warning”, sort of like a “free pass”, a message saying, “You should be very careful because it’ll be so much worse, if not fatally worse, the next time.”Senator Richard Gordon has warned about this in as early as December 2015 Persons who get sick with the dengue virus for the first time suffer from mild dengue, which is generally not a serious disease. The problem, however, is when the same person gets sick for the second time, because it’s when severe dengue happens.Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment [1] Hence, a person’s first dengue infection is like a “warning”, sort of like a “free pass”, a message saying, “You should be very careful because it’ll be so much worse, if not fatally worse, the next time.”Senator Richard Gordon has warned about this in as early as December 2015 [2] when he said Sanofi itself admitted risks, but the DoH ignored him.Anti-Dengue Mass Vaccination Program In early April 2016, the DoH launched a massive anti-dengue immunization program covering 1 million 4th grade students in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and NCRAt the time, both Sanofi and the World Health Organization have warned against vaccinating those with no history of dengueLet me state this more clearly: If a person has never had dengue before and gets bitten by a mosquito for the first time, that person will get mild dengue. However, if that same person who has never had dengue is vaccinated with Dengvaxia AND gets bitten for the first time, he gets severe dengue right away. In short, Dengvaxia dramatically worsens dengue symptoms for those who have never had dengue beforeI feel that Sanofi was a bit sneaky with this warning because they called it a “theoretical risk”, as clinical trials on 2- to 14- y/o kids confirmed that Dengvaxia has the exact same effects on those aged 2 to 9. The trial, however, has very few test subjects aged 9 and up, so Sanofi can’t say yet if Dengvaxia does the same to that age group. In early April 2016, the DoH launched a massive anti-dengue immunization program covering 1 million 4th grade students in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and NCR [3] . The program used Sanofi’s newly-developed vaccine Dengvaxia which, at the time, was recommended only for individuals have had dengue before and are 9 years or older [4] At the time, both Sanofi and the World Health Organization have warned against vaccinating those with no history of dengue [5] . This warning stems from the vaccine’s tendency to act as the “first infection”, so that the first “real” infection (through a mosquito bite) will mimic the symptoms of a second infection.Let me state this more clearly: If a person has never had dengue before and gets bitten by a mosquito for the first time, that person will get mild dengue. However, if that same person who has never had dengue is vaccinated with Dengvaxia AND gets bitten for the first time, he gets severe dengue right away. In short, Dengvaxia dramatically worsens dengue symptoms for those who have never had dengue before [6] I feel that Sanofi was a bit sneaky with this warning because they called it a “theoretical risk”, as clinical trials on 2- to 14- y/o kids confirmed that Dengvaxia has the exact same effects on those aged 2 to 9. The trial, however, has very few test subjects aged 9 and up, so Sanofi can’t say yet if Dengvaxia does the same to that age group.Sanofi’s material concealment, DoH’s mathematical manipulation However, instead of finding additional suitable test subjects (i.e. aged 9 and up with no dengue history), Sanofi marketed the vaccine right away. After all, Sanofi’s trials basically proved that Dengvaxia is not for 9 and below. If they did another trial for those 9 and above and confirmed the same adverse results, then Dengvaxia would’ve gone straight to the trash bin. That is, the $1.78 billion they’ve invested in the past 20 years would’ve gone to wasteAnd here comes another problem.DoH wanted to inject 1 million kids with Dengvaxia, even if they are not sure who among them have had dengue before (seropositive) or and those who have not (seronegative).According to WHO’s April 2016 paper on Dengvaxia, the vaccine may still be used for mass immunizations if at least 70% of target population is seropositive, and that’s what the DoH used to justify its vaccination programTo do this, they cited a 2016 studyThis is bad math, to say the least, because the test samples (from Cebu) ARE NOT representative of the target population (from Luzon). And despite this glaring flaw, Malacañan, through Spokesperson Roque However, instead of finding additional suitable test subjects (i.e. aged 9 and up with no dengue history), Sanofi marketed the vaccine right away. After all, Sanofi’s trials basically proved that Dengvaxia is not for 9 and below. If they did another trial for those 9 and above and confirmed the same adverse results, then Dengvaxia would’ve gone straight to the trash bin. That is, the $1.78 billion they’ve invested in the past 20 years would’ve gone to waste [7] And here comes another problem.DoH wanted to inject 1 million kids with Dengvaxia, even if they are not sure who among them have had dengue before (seropositive) or and those who have not (seronegative).According to WHO’s April 2016 paper on Dengvaxia, the vaccine may still be used for mass immunizations if at least 70% of target population is seropositive, and that’s what the DoH used to justify its vaccination program [8] To do this, they cited a 2016 study [9] , where it was found out that 90% of 1,000 randomly selected residents of Punta Princesa, Cebu City are seropositive. The DoH extrapolated Cebu City data to say that 90% of 4th graders in NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzon are seropositive, which would supposedly fulfill WHO’s guidelines.This is bad math, to say the least, because the test samples (from Cebu) ARE NOT representative of the target population (from Luzon). And despite this glaring flaw, Malacañan, through Spokesperson Roque [10] and Secretary Duque [11] , still uses this justification.DoH endangered over 830,000 kids DoH was actually unsure about how many and which among the 1 million kids targeted are seronegativeI should also note that the same WHO document advises against mass vaccinating populations where less than 50% are seropositiveDoH Sec. Duque has confirmed that at least 830,000 kidsMr. President, this is a big mess. A big, deadly mess. DoH was actually unsure about how many and which among the 1 million kids targeted are seronegative [12] . As I have said before, Dengvaxia worsens dengue symptoms for seronegative recipients, i.e. children who have not had dengue.I should also note that the same WHO document advises against mass vaccinating populations where less than 50% are seropositive [13] . The problem, however, was that DoH was in a strange rush so they did away with testing children and vaccinated them right away.DoH Sec. Duque has confirmed that at least 830,000 kids [14] have been vaccinated so far. The vaccine, which was for a time also available from local private vendors, was also privately administered to many Filipinos. DoH doesn’t know which ones of those 830,000 kids have never had dengue before. That is, DoH doesn’t know which ones require monitoring and which ones who don’t.Mr. President, this is a big mess. A big, deadly mess.Let’s take care of the 830,000 kids first Before I discuss how the situation has gone this bad, let me first recommend a few preliminary courses of action so that we can minimize the harm caused to the 830,000 kids by this DoH debacle.First, de-escalate through information Simply telling people not to panic will not prevent them from panicking. Instead, you may want to ask for airtime from the major networks so you can address the entire country and explain to them what’s going on and what you are doing or planning to do about it.You can also ask DepEd to to discuss the issue during PTA meetings. You may also order social workers in affected areas to visit the homes.Reach out to Dengvaxia victims to reassure them that the government is doing its best to address the situation. Instruct the social workers to educate the families on ways to mitigate the situation. More than lowering mortality rates, this can help calm down panicky parents who are clueless about what’s going on.Second, create an emergency fund Please set up an emergency fund that hospitals, whether private or public, can tap into anytime. Set it up in such a way that a hospital can withdraw from it to cover the expenses of any patient who reports a fever and fits the profile of those who were under the botched vaccination program, or shows any proof that they have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia.This way, parents of Dengvaxia victims, who are typically not well off, will be less likely to think twice about consulting doctorsThird, restore trust in the public health system Please suspend or terminate all officials who have a lot to do with this mess. This way, we can help quell the public’s doubts on the integrity and general reliability of the public healthcare system.Now, let’s ask: How did it come this far? Please set up an emergency fund that hospitals, whether private or public, can tap into anytime. Set it up in such a way that a hospital can withdraw from it to cover the expenses of any patient who reports a fever and fits the profile of those who were under the botched vaccination program, or shows any proof that they have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia.This way, parents of Dengvaxia victims, who are typically not well off, will be less likely to think twice about consulting doctors [15] , enabling the medical establishment to diagnose dengue cases early, thereby lowering mortality rates.Please suspend or terminate all officials who have a lot to do with this mess. This way, we can help quell the public’s doubts on the integrity and general reliability of the public healthcare system.First, FDA changed rules in 2013 to favor Sanofi One major main point of contention in this vaccine scandal is the uncertainty of Dengvaxia’s effects on seronegative recipients (never had dengue) aged 9 and up. An issue where the WHO said “it is critical to evaluate as soon as possible whether there is any risk to this populationPhase IV drug trials could have addressed this issue. In Phase IV drug trials, a new drug is sold publicly to 3,000 people per year for three years as doctors closely monitor recipients for adverse effectsThat is exactly what Malaysia demanded in April this year before it clears Dengvaxia thereI have reason to believe that Hartigan-Go did this to benefit Sanofi. Before joining government, Hartigan-Go was an Executive Director of Zuellig Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Zuellig Pharma, Sanofi’s official local distributors. After leaving government in June 2016, Hartigan-Go headed AIM’s Zuellig SchoolHe is Zuellig through-and-through. Suffice it to say, the Philippines’ de facto Phase IV Dengvaxia trial was done on 830,000 innocent children. Hartigan-Go, regardless of intent, indeed used 830,000 Filipino kids as laboratory rats. One major main point of contention in this vaccine scandal is the uncertainty of Dengvaxia’s effects on seronegative recipients (never had dengue) aged 9 and up. An issue where the WHO said “it is critical to evaluate as soon as possible whether there is any risk to this population [16] .”Phase IV drug trials could have addressed this issue. In Phase IV drug trials, a new drug is sold publicly to 3,000 people per year for three years as doctors closely monitor recipients for adverse effects [17] That is exactly what Malaysia demanded in April this year before it clears Dengvaxia there [18] , and that is exactly what the Philippine failed to do in as far as Dengvaxia. In 2013, then FDA chief Kenneth Hartigan-Go made Phase IV trials optional when he said manufacturers, by themselves, can decide whether to do Phase IV trials or not [19] . Thus, Sanofi was able to market Dengvaxia right after their Phase III trials ended.I have reason to believe that Hartigan-Go did this to benefit Sanofi. Before joining government, Hartigan-Go was an Executive Director of Zuellig Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Zuellig Pharma, Sanofi’s official local distributors. After leaving government in June 2016, Hartigan-Go headed AIM’s Zuellig School [20] He is Zuellig through-and-through. Suffice it to say, the Philippines’ de facto Phase IV Dengvaxia trial was done on 830,000 innocent children. Hartigan-Go, regardless of intent, indeed used 830,000 Filipino kids as laboratory rats.Second, corruption in procurement The Aquino Government has been in talks with Sanofi in as early as 2014, when PNoy met Sanofi during the Beijing APEC summitLess than a month after the Paris meetings and before 2015 ended, DBM has already released a SARO for P3.5 billion, sourced from the Office of the President’s Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and transferred to the Philippine Children’s Medical CenterPCMC received P3 billion from these funds and used it to buy Dengvaxia. This amount raises suspicion because Sanofi declared only EUR 20 million (P1 billion) in Dengvaxia sales for Q1 2016Where did the other P2 billion pesos go?What made this whole thing even more irregular is that all these procurement steps were taken before Dengvaxia was discussed by the Formulary Executive Council. All drugs require FEC approval before the government can procure them, and the Aquino Government procured Dengvaxia without one, as the FEC approval (exemption) was issued after the fact. The Aquino Government has been in talks with Sanofi in as early as 2014, when PNoy met Sanofi during the Beijing APEC summit [21] . In May 2015, DOH Sec. Garin clandestinely met Sanofi in France and taught the French executives how to entice our Congress to purchase Dengvaxia [22] . Lastly, in early December 2015, Pnoy, Garin, and other cabinet members met with Sanofi on the days surrounding the Paris Accord meetings [23] Less than a month after the Paris meetings and before 2015 ended, DBM has already released a SARO for P3.5 billion, sourced from the Office of the President’s Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and transferred to the Philippine Children’s Medical Center [24] . That is, despite the DAP ruling issued earlier in February 2015 [25] , the Aquino Government used a DAP-like mechanism just 10 months later [26] PCMC received P3 billion from these funds and used it to buy Dengvaxia. This amount raises suspicion because Sanofi declared only EUR 20 million (P1 billion) in Dengvaxia sales for Q1 2016 [27] Where did the other P2 billion pesos go?What made this whole thing even more irregular is that all these procurement steps were taken before Dengvaxia was discussed by the Formulary Executive Council. All drugs require FEC approval before the government can procure them, and the Aquino Government procured Dengvaxia without one, as the FEC approval (exemption) was issued after the fact.Third, coverup within DOH Evidence suggests that DoH rank and file may be trying to cover up the Dengvaxia messI stumbled upon the case of a 12-year-old child in Capas, Tarlac, who contracted severe dengue just three months after receiving the third and final dose of DengvaxiaI spoke to the mother over the phone and she told me that she did not sign any consent form, that she found out about her daughters vaccination only after the fact.The child’s family is very poor. The mother even had to borrow money just to get the child admitted to a hospital in Tarlac City. She was openly soliciting for financial through social media and I told her that I will visit her the next day to speak to her, to hand her a few thousand pesos from my own pocket, and to ask her to ask her to fill out several forms so I can help her get more substantial financial help from charitable GOCCs and public officials.Upon arriving at the hospital, however, I discovered that DOH-Tarlac has whisked her away to Pampanga two hours prior. I would’ve given DOH the benefit of the doubt, if not for the fact that the hospital staff told me that DOH paid for her outstanding balance. The hospital is privately-owned the child has been in ICU for a couple of days or so. I doubt that DOH has discretionary funds that it can use to bail out patients just like that.I smell a cover up. If the DOH bailed out that 12-year-old, then why didn’t it bail out the 12-year-old’s neighbors, who were also stricken with dengue and admitted in the same hospital?With that said, I have serious doubts about the accuracy of reports that Secretary Duque has been receiving.

Prior to Sanofi’s November admissionHowever, according to some of the resource persons invited in the first hearing, several congressmen, including then party-list Representative Harry Roque, attempted to prevent anti-Dengvaxia resource persons to testify.On the first day, Roque told Philhealth director Dr. Tony Leachon, a resource person, that the latter cannot be allowed to testify because of the lack of approval from the Philippine College of Physicians, of which Leachon was president. This defies logic because Leachon is an expert on the issue with or without PCP approval.According to Leachon, Roque and the other congressmen stayed mum as former Health Sec. Janette Garin, who was just an audience member during the hearing, kept on standing up and intimidating the witness. Leachon said Garin went hysterical so the presiding officer was forced to adjourn the first hearing only an hour after it started, no complaints or admonitions against Garin came from Roque.A few hours prior to the second hearing, Roque approached Leachon and asked him to state his credentials as Roque had it videotaped. When the hearing started, Roque played a spliced version of the footage and made it appear that Leachon, a very accomplished physician, was overconfident. That is, Roque character-assassinated Leachon even before Leachon was able to speak in front of the committee.Please call Dr. Tony Leachon to confirm these allegations.I would not have made a big deal out of this if not for the fact that Roque actively defended Sanofi when the Dengue Vaccine Scandal erupted a couple of weeks ago. As a presidential spokesperson, he should have exercised restraint and put into mind that he speaks on the president’s behalf. Surely, the president that I supported from Day One would have better things to say than “Don’t panic.”It’s also weird that Secretary Duque flip-flopped on his pronouncements and I suspect Roque has a hand in it.About a week ago, Duque said Aquino should attend the Senate probe on DengvaxiaMy sources said Roque pressured Duque in the same way Roque pressured then Health Sec. Paulyn Ubial during her confirmation hearings. Roque was instrumental in blocking Ubial’s confirmation, mainly because of Ubial’s opposition to the defective Dengvaxia vaccine. Duque, Ubial’s replacement, is also up for confirmation, so my sources said Roque told Duque that the latter will suffer the same fate if the latter doesn’t co-operate.I have reason to believe that the Office of the President has two primary sources for this Dengvaxia mess: Health Secretary Duque, who is under intense pressure to get confirmed; and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who still wields influence in the Lower House and who has historically antagonized those who oppose Dengvaxia.Mr. President, you said before that you will axe anyone in your cabinet who demonstrates even a whiff of corruption.Mr. President, behold Harry Roque. He may not be addicted to money, but he's addicted to power.And I believe that that kind of addiction, Mr. President, is a problem worse than drugs.

Bong Go, so here it is. You said I don't have to sign it, but I decided to publish it on my blog too. I stand by what I write, pero salamat pa rin po sa pag-unawa.I have spoken with dengue experts, government officials, and victims’ families to learn more about what happened. Adding the results of extensive research about this particular issue, here’s a relatively short brief of the nightmare that’s haunting almost a million children and their families today. This is by no means an exhaustive discussion of the problem. Please consult experts on the issue, experts from both sides, so that you can get a better picture of what has happened.With that said, let's start with the basics.",

    "body": "Inday Sara to CBCP Soc Villegas: Dad knows spirit of EDSA more than you doDavao City Mayor Sara Duterte on Friday lambasted Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) president Archbishop Socrates Villegas following the latter’s rant against the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte in a letter to the late Jaime Cardinal Sin.In a statement, Sara said Villegas is much worse than Duterte for failing to acknowledge the country’s problems even before her dad became the Chief Executive and for monopolizing the meaning of EDSA.“Unfortunately for you Archbishop Villegas, this is not a biased commentary on your letter to the dead because I am not a fan of President Duterte,” she said.“But you are truly, madly, deeply worse than a hundred President Dutertes,” she added.Sara argued that the problems of the nation did not start during her father’s term.The CBCP president in his letter said that the past months had been a “nightmare.”“Oh, dear Archbishop. How dare you say that my father has singlehandedly defaced the memory of the EDSA revolution,” she said.“Since 1986 and until seven months ago, I remember that our nation has been hounded by corruption, crime, territorial war of gangs and druglords, extrajudicial killings, narco politics, terrorism, protracted rebellion, abuse of power in government, political bickering and the entry of foreign mafias,” she added.“It surely did not start when President Duterte took office. He won the presidency precisely because you ignored what was wrong with this world,” Sara continued.Sara said Villegas is a hypocrite because he failed to see why the people voted for Duterte who promised to get rid of illegal drugs, crime, and corruption.“All you desired was to put into power a leader who walks and talks like you — someone who is definitely not Rodrigo Duterte. When your friend failed as a President, I cannot remember you calling it the rape of EDSA. You just swept it under your glitzy rugs and you moved on, back to business — back to acting as if you can save us all from hell,” she said.“Your group is sadly a bunch of delusional hypocrites. While all of you were up there riding high on your horses, you failed to notice that many of us down here empathize with what Rodrigo Duterte is saying because it is the hard truth. It is truly without the air of [hypocrisy] that we smell from your kind,” she added.“How dare you call us pimps of the EDSA spirit and yet it is you who cannot accept what has happened to our country since 1986,” she continued.Sara, who was seven years old during the EDSA People Power Revolution, also recalled that time when Duterte woke her up on the eve of February 25, 1986 after the Filipinos toppled the regime of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos.“While we were huddled in the car, he told us, ‘Timan-i ninyo ning gabhiona ni. Ayaw ninyo kalimti [Remember this night. Do not forget this night],'” she said.She said Duterte brought them to the San Pedro Church as crowds celebrated the successful bloodless revolution. Sara’s late grandmother, Soledad “Nanay Soling” Duterte, was one of the key figures of the anti-Marcos Yellow Friday Movement in Davao.“My father perfectly understood what the spirit of EDSA is, otherwise, he would not have told me to never forget that night of 31 years ago. And I now believe that he understands it better than you do,” she said.While Sara said that it is important to commemorate what the people did for the country during the EDSA People Power Revolution, she couldn’t grasp why only the elite and their friends including Villegas could define its meaning.“I find it hard to understand why this bloodless revolution has become the standard definition of freedom for our country and this standard is forced down our throats by a certain group of individuals who think they are better than everyone else. These are the elite and their friends, including Archbishop Villegas,” she said.“You preach about freedom as if you invented it, as if it is your gift to us. Let me tell you what freedom is. It is to live a life that is free from your selective moral standard. This is what the meaning of EDSA is,” she added. [source]Commentscomments",

    "body": "It was in the province of Yunnan, China where the tale of Qian Hongyan started. The little girl dubbed ‘Basketball Girl’ was living a peaceful and joyful life. Little did she know that she would encounter a tragic incident that would turn her entire world upside down.Loading...In the year 2000, 4-year-old Qian was involved in a serious car accident. The doctors had to amputate her legs to ensure her survival. Qian’s family couldn’t afford to buy prosthetics or any other form of medical treatment that would help their child walk again.Thus began Qian’s stagnant life. She had to stay home, unable to do what normal kids do, thinking to herself that she would forever be trapped within the walls of her home. But one day, her grandfather thought of an ingenious way to save the little girl from her anxiety.Qian’s grandfather brought home a basketball. He cut away part of the basketball and then attached it to Qian’s legs. He then made two wooden handles to support Qian’s weight.And that’s the day Qian came to be known as ‘Basketball Girl’.This was a monumental moment in Qian’s life. She shared:“From the very beginning when I started using it, I became incredibly happy. For the first time, I felt I could finally get out of bed, out of the room and out into the yard, and had a much bigger space to play in, a much bigger world.”Her story spread like wildfire and became known all over the world. With the help of numerous donations, Qian was able to experience the joy of walking again with the use of new prosthetic legs. Eventually, she was able to finish primary school.Because of her family’s financial instability during that time, she was unable to pursue her studies. In the face of this disheartening situation, Qian Hongyan decided to make her own destiny.According to Daily Mail, she was encouraged to join South of the Cloud, a local swim team for people with disabilities in China. She used her drive, resilience, and perseverance to propel her towards her dream.It all paid off when the hardworking ‘Basketball Girl’ qualified for the 2009 Paralympics, wherein she bagged one gold medal and two silver medals.Through grit and determination, Qian succeeded and she soon started winning numerous medals at national competitions all over China.Qian is no longer ‘basketball girl’ due to her new prostheses. Now, the prolific swimmer is a true inspiration to everyone who is faced with a life of disability.Qian admitted that it was not easy to swim and compete professionally. Although she had the option to give up, her secret is that she simply didn’t. The accident took her legs, but not her heart.Qian Hongyan reminds us that every cloud has a silver lining.Loading...Commentscomments",

    "body": "Previously, rumors sparked that Willie Revillame would fire all of his hosts in his program “Wowowin.” One of the first people who defended him was Donita Nose, a comedian. He cleared the rumors and explained:“Uy, no, hindi… hindi. Nag-ano lang… kasi parang nagkaroon ng special edition ng Wowowin, dahil nga dun sa nagbigay siya [Willie] ng tribute para sa mga sundalo ng Marawi. Kasi gusto niya na siya lang yun, kasi medyo sensitive, so inano muna na siya [lang]…Pero wala… wala.”The comedian also mentioned that it was the program’s director, John Paul Panizales, who really thought of the hosts having a break. Donita Nose shared:“Actually, magbabakasyon, e. Wala talaga kaming taping kasi mag-u-Undas, so may plano siyang [Willie Revillame] mag-bakasyon ng Macau.”On Nov. 1, 2017, the website of Balita reported that Willie was the only one who seemed to host the program. Audiences noticed that not one of the familiar faces they used to see (such as Ashley Ortega, Ara Arida, and Donita Nose) were present.Now, in a recent report by GMA Entertainment, it was revealed that Donita Nose would no longer be seen in the program for the meantime. The comedian said that he respected and understood Willie’s decision. The source added that Donita does not harbor any ill feelings towards the host either.Instead, he mentioned that he felt grateful for having such an opportunity to be part of the program, which boosted his career in the showbiz industry. Donita Nose shared:“Sobra-sobrang, sobra-sobrang pasasalamat [ko] sa kanya sa naitulong niya sa akin. Kasi hindi naman ako mapupunta sa Celebrity Bluff, kung hindi naman ako nakita sa Wowowin, hindi ako mapupunta ng Dear Uge kundi sa Wowowin, hindi ako mapupunta ng kahit anong show dito sa GMA kundi dahil sa Wowowin. Kaya, sa kanya nag-umpisa ang lahat.”He said that he extremely owes a lot to Willie. The comedian added:“Sabi ko nga sa kanya, utang na loob ko ‘yung mga nangyayari ngayon sa buhay ko. Isa ito sa pinakamahalagang nangyari sa buhay ko na naging artista ako, na nakilala ako kahit papaano.”“Siya ang nagbigay ng break sa akin na parang bilang ganito nga, bading, alam kong minahal naman ako ni Kuya pagdating sa show.”“At saka sobrang love ko ‘yun. Actually sabi ko nga sa kanya, walang Donita Nose kung wala ‘yung Wowowin ‘tsaka wala si Kuya Wil, kasi siya talaga nag-umpisa ng lahat, kung ano ako ngayon, kung ano si Tekla ngayon.”He also imparted a message to the host. Donita Nose said:“Doon kami nag-umpisa sa kanya so, thank you Kuya. Mahal kita, alam mo ‘yan. Mahal na mahal kita kahit na hindi tayo magkasama ngayon dahil marami kang ginagawa sa show mo, pero still nandito pa rin naman ako para sa’yo.”What do you think of this, readers?

    "body": "Recently, it was reported that President Rodrigo Duterte is requesting for martial law in Mindanao to be extended up to next year. Senator Manny Pacquiao shared that he’s in favor of the president’s decision.According to GMA News Online, the senator said that Mindanao locals feel safer if martial law is implemented in their region. He shared:“Taga-General Santos ako, wala namang problema. Mas masaya nga kami sa martial law ng Mindanao dahil safe kami, nakakalabas kami, naglalakad kami ng wala kaming bodyguard.”Pacquiao said that martial law being extended for 2018 is not a bad thing since there have been no particular incidents of abuse reported after it being implemented this year.The senator added:“Hindi naman namin nararamdaman ‘yung martial law, as usual pa rin, ganun naman. Walang problema. Wala namang nang-aabuso.”Duterte requested the Congress to extend the implementation of martial law in Mindanao up to Dec. 31, 2018.Based on the Philippine Constitution of 1987, the Congress has the right to determine whether there is a need to revoke or continue a martial law implementation done by the president.Previously, on July 22, 2017, the Congress approved Duterte’s request to extend martial law in Mindanao up to Dec. 31, 2017. On May 23, 2017, it was initially implemented in the region following a 60-day limit.The president cited that Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana believed the martial law should be additionally implemented to “ensure total eradication of the DAESH-inpsired Da’awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq, other like-minded local and foreign terror groups and armed lawless groups, the communist terrorists and their coddlers, supporters, and financiers.”Manny Pacquiao belongs in the PDP-Laban, making him a fellow party member of Duterte.In an additional report from Philippine Daily Inquirer, the senator was quoted saying, “Mas maganda nga yung martial law dun eh. Kung baga hindi ka matatakot mamasyal, safe.”He continued:“Siya ang nakakaalam sa sitwasyon sa Mindanao. Tayo naman eh kulang sa kaalaman… Mas marami siyang alam kung ano ang problema ng Mindanao.” “So para sa akin, we should give respect and trust to the President kung ano ang decision. Magtiwala lang tayo sa Pangulo.”What do you think about the stance of Manny Pacquiao in extending martial law in Mindanao? Do you agree with him?

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Friday, May 23rd, 2014Reports have been coming in this morning that Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile has voluntarily checked himself into a computer game addiction rehab center in Taguig City.The exact location however, is not immediately known.Enrile is widely known to have been addicted to the popular computer game, Bejeweled, but this development still comes as a shock to many of his constituents and peers, since no one realized that his addiction was so severe, prompting the senator to voluntarily check himself in for rehabilitation.“I pray for Sen. Enrile’s quick recovery,” said Sen. Mirriam Defensor-Santiago. “I will miss him sorely on the senate floor, how he courteously manages to divide his attention between his Bejeweled game and me, whenever I am at the podium delivering my speech,” Santiago reminisces.In a phone interview with Eritas Times, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada was equally surprised with the news. “I am shocked,” said Sen. Estrada. “We were just planning our PDAF alibi and flight strategy at his house two days ago, with Sen. Revilla, and everything seemed fine [with Enrile] at the time. There was no indication that he has gone overboard. Well, basically just the usual inattention to details and absent mindedness, you know, things associated with old farts like him, but everything seemed fine,” Estrada recounts.Eritas Times learned that treatment for such an addiction involves daily electric shock therapy of no less than 480 volts/20 amps, and sleep deprivation, while the patient is tied naked to a cold stainless steel gurney for 90 days.However, it was not immediately known how long the 90 year old senator is staying at the facility.A few citizens have begun to show concern, as the Senator is a well respected public figure, especially to those who have witnessed his service to the country as a Minister of Defense, basically the right-hand man for former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.“I hope to see him well very soon,” said a bystander at the rehab center. “My father and brother were kidnapped my Marcos’ people in the 70’s and I have yet to find them. I think he may be able to help me with some clues, ” he added.Sen. Enrile’s collection of Apple iPads will be donated to the player with the highest Bejeweled score on September 21.",

Ayon sa pulis, tinambangan daw sila ng mga rebeldeng komunista.

And I told (Defense Secretary Delfin) Lorenzana na paghatian ninyo na lalo na ‘yung sniper. Very beautiful. You’ll get it in a matter of days,” said Duterte in a speech in Davao City Thursday. Duterte is expecting anohter batch of sniper rifles from China in September.Duterte ordered Special Assistant to the President Bong Go to rush the ballistic examinations of the sniper rifles because couldn’t wait to deploy these as soon as possible to his men on the field in Marawi.“I hope that you can assemble about one battalion of snipers para — mahusay kung marami tayong snipers. They are also sniping at us and they have the beautiful guns, they have the Barretts,” said Duterte referring to the US Military issued Barret M107semi-automatic sniper rifle used by Maute snipers in Marawi City.“Well, it’s a deadly firearm, it can reach you almost one kilometer away. But may panlaban naman tayo. Marami man rin tayong Barrett. And with additional arms, I think we will find it easy really to operate,” said Duterte.After the Marawi war, Duterte is planning to investigate how these Barrettes issued by the Department of National Defense found their way into the hands of the enemy. He said one of the reasons why the Marawi war has lasted this long was because of the well-positioned snipers of Maute.“Taas kasi sila eh. So tayo, uphill. Nakaposisyon na ‘yung snipers nila, ‘yung mga Barrett. So practically we ha — we were in open country. So, every building was occupied with one or two… So, naparami ‘yung casualties natin,” said Duterte.",

    "body": "Countless inspiring stories of rescue, friendship, and love humans and their best friend, the dog, have already been written. While dogs are among, if not the most, tamed animals, they are still beasts who have beastly instincts. These instincts can kick in if we neglect them and treat them without respect. This gruesome story from Virginia, USA is a gruesome reminder that we should always remember to treat animals correctly.Bethany Stephens was a loving mother to two pit bulls, Tonka and Pac-Man. Her Facebook account was filled with pictures of her cuddling dogs, The 22-year-old woman treated Tonka and Pac-Man like kings in their household.But when Bethany was going through a rough divorce, she handed both dogs to her father, John. Sgt. Mike Blackwood from the Goochland County Sheriff’s Office stated that John didn’t take care of the dogs because he didn’t see them as his responsibility. This change in lifestyle and attention caused what they called a “negative scenario.”Certified dog trainer Valerie Paul explained the scenario as:“The breed in and of itself is a high energy breed, they like to have a lot of structure and a lot of exercise, so by keeping them in a pin, alone, under socialized, away from people, that energy is just building up and building up and building up and that’s when you start to see dogs fighting more regularly, that’s when you start to see more negative scenarios.“Local authorities ruled out foul play due to the forensic reports saying that it was a relatively small animal that caused the bite marks and scratches. Goochland County Sheriff James Agnew said:“There was no evidence of any larger animal there. The medical examiner made it pretty clear that it was not a large animal because the bite wounds didn’t puncture her skull. There were also scratch marks consistent with a smaller animal than something like a bear.“Tonka and Pac-Man have been euthanized with the family consent while other family friends believe that the dogs were innocent. Agnew defended the euthanization saying that it was all for the safety of the community.“What I observed personally, it was in the community’s best interest. Once a dog tastes human flesh it is not safe to have that dog around humans.“Do you think Bethany’s murder was done by her dogs? Does this reinforce the stereotype of pit bulls being dangerous dogs?

    "body": "From July to September, the Philippine economy swelled by 6.9% – dumbfounding the government’s critics and virtually guaranteeing that the administration’s full-year growth target of between 6.5% and 6.7% will be comfortably achieved.That third-quarter figure isn’t an aberration; it doesn’t lie. It’s the result of a sound fiscal policy focused on a nation-building programme that seeks to attract high levels of investment by displaying business-friendly credentials and liberalising market entry for overseas firms.It’s the other side of the coin to one usually shown by those opposed to President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule. In fact, the only time they bring up the economy is when they can show it in a bad light. They’ll flag an underperformance of the stock market, a weakening of the peso – neither of which has anything much to do with the economy’s fundamentals – or issue some scare story about investors pulling out or taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding future investment plans; stories which they back up with an extraordinary lack of evidence.Certainly, the Philippines is a volatile market – but not for the reasons the critics put forward. The volatility in this market is not the result of Duterte’s War on Drugs, nor his battle to subdue Islamic-extremist groups in the south of the country; nor the ongoing seemingly interminable conflict with the communist New People’s Army. Of course these are all issues that have to be weighed, but the reality is that their influence on the broader economy is limited.The real market volatility comes from the onslaught of negative publicity aimed at undermining the president and his government. This is being driven by a political opposition lead by the Liberal Party which was vanquished in the May 2016 election that propelled Duterte to power. It would seem for them, and their coterie of human-rights groups and tame media – both domestic and international – that economic failure would be a price well worth paying if it can deliver them back into office.We’re not saying there’s no political risk in the Philippines; of course there is – there always has been as there is elsewhere in most countries of Southeast Asia. The archipelago’s Muslim and communist insurgencies are hardly new – they’re age-old problems, but wretched though they are for society they’ve never ever come close to bringing the economy to its knees.So how stable is the government – the litmus test for political risk? Well, despite its opponents’ best efforts to destabilise it, it’s very stable. For one thing, Duterte is extremely popular with his people. A poll produced last month by Pulse Asia Research Inc. put his approval rating at 80% and his trust rating at 80%.This isn’t Venezuela where mass protests denounce the illegitimacy of the government and call for their president to step down – Filipinos have got the government they want and the president they want. In fact, the best chance of a Venezuela happening in the Philippines is if Duterte is removed from power. In short, this government has an overwhelming mandate from the people.Then there’s the vote of confidence from the credit-rating agencies, all of which have the Philippines at investment grade or above investment grade – Japan Credit Rating Agency, BBB+; Moody’s, Baa2; S&P, BBB; Fitch Ratings, BBB-. Ratings agencies aren’t noted for going out on a limb – in fact, in anything they lean towards the side of caution.And yet, despite the blitz of negative publicity generated by opponents ranging from Human Rights Watch to the New York Times to the Philippine Roman Catholic Church to CNN to Liberal International to progressive-Left politicians from nearly every page of the atlas, the ratings agencies are of one mind; that the outlook for the Philippines is ”stable” and “positive”.Furthermore, they’re likely to stay that way even if Duterte did actually decide to form a revolutionary government – something which he said at the weekend would only happen “if things got out of control”; if there was a real danger of a violent coup.Thailand, a fellow member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, actually has a revolutionary government; a military junta. It’s called the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council and it’s been in control of the country, and its economy, since 22 May 2014 when its leaders took power in a coup d’état. Here are Thailand’s current credit ratings: Japan Credit Rating Agency, A+; Moody’s, Baa1; S&P, BBB+; Fitch Ratings, BBB+. They’re actually better than the Philippines’.So if Duterte did decide to go the Thai route and install a Filipino version of the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council, its credit rating would be unlikely to budge. Neither would his approval and trust ratings – Duterte’s supporters have regularly urged him to establish a revolutionary government to allow him to get on with his reform programme.Investors, therefore, need to take what they read in the papers and hear from the TV networks with a very large pinch of salt. ‘Economic analysis’ from those quarters is no such thing – it’s the avoidance of economic facts that would weaken their political argument. They cannot afford to make positive points about the management of the Philippine economy – to do that would be tantamount to endorsing Duterte. So that’s not going to happen.Is their instability in the Cabinet – another indicator of political risk? There is not. Destabilising elements have been removed. Liberal Party chairman, Vice President Leni Robredo, the virtually self-styled leader of the opposition, was asked to “desist from attending all Cabinet meetings” as of 5 December last year.Left-progressives who opposed Duterte in Cabinet on a number of issues – for example over his approval of former president Ferdinand E. Marcos’s burial in the Heroes’ Cemetery in Manila – have also departed. Social Welfare secretary, Judy Taguiwalo, Agrarian Reform secretary, Rafael Mariano both failed to win approval from the Commission on Appointments.The same fate befell Environment and Natural Resources secretary, Gina Lopez, whose draconian mining policy complete with the blanket issuance of mine-closure orders threatened to split the Cabinet at one stage.Perhaps with a couple of very minor exceptions, Duterte’s Cabinet is solidly behind him. It includes childhood friends, former classmates, San Beda College of Law fraternity brothers, PDP-Laban party mates and long-time political allies, members of his presidential transition committee – as well as former military and police chiefs who go back to his days as mayor of Davao City.In short, it’s extremely loyal. But it also has at its core some very capable individuals – among them, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, an economist and former banker who’s headed some of the country’s largest corporations, including Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier; National Economic and Development Authority secretary, Ernesto Pernia, an economics scholar and former lead economist with the Asian Development Bank; Budget secretary, Benjamin Diokno, a highly respected economist who held this same post from 1998-2001 in the Joseph Estrada administration.Add to them, Trade secretary Ramon Lopez, an economist with more than 20 years experience in the private sector as head of a large, publicly listed corporation, and Transport Secretary, former businessman and consummate administrator, Arthur Tugade – the former president and CEO of Clark Development Corporation.In short, there’s no political risk there – nor is there any lack of talent. Furthermore, among the policymakers there’s virtually no discord – a remarkable situation for Philippine Cabinets which are notorious for disagreements and squabbles. This must be one of the most cohesive executives in Philippine Government history.The main reason for that is that, to a Cabinet member, all are fully on board with the Duterte-inspired socio-economic agenda. In short, as far as the economy is concerned, everyone’s on the same page and everyone’s pressing to get things done. It’s just a pity that the legislative branch – specifically the Philippine Senate – doesn’t follow that example.None of this, however, appears in the perspectives provided by the anti-Duterte media. And for the investment community that’s very unhelpful. There’s no question, as far as we’re concerned, the Philippines is on the cusp of achieving great things. It has a well-defined direction and a strong determination. The potential is impossible to ignore.As the mainstream media and the political opposition – wherever they’re from – has been warning of the dangers of Duterte and his policies, The Volatilian™ has been making the case for investing in the Philippines. We’ve been doing that since 30 June 2016, the day Duterte was inaugurated as the Republic’s 16th president. And we’ll continue doing it until something happens to make us change our mind. But right now, there’s nothing that shakes our conviction. If anything, we’re even more convinced.That’s really the end of this article, but below are a number of extracts from, and links to, some of our investment coverage over the past months. We’re including it here as reference material should you want it.“Certainly, there will be teething problems for the economy – that goes with the territory when any new administration takes over the reins – but overall the outlook for foreign investors in the Philippines looks bright”. [30 Jun. 2016. The Volatilian™ Investment Assessment].“Right now, the Philippines is in transition as it moves to a socio-economic model. This is the new normal which international investors need to get their head around if they are going to trade successfully and profitably in this market”. [6 Sept. 2016. No more time for TIME-warps].“This is where the elevator starts its ascent. This is where investors need to get a firm grasp of the realities and the potential that lie beneath the current volatility – that, or consign potential future profits to the bonfire of fear being stoked by Duterte’s opponents in a spate of arson fueled by the propaganda of their agenda”. [26 Sept. 2016. Media bias – costly to investors].“But given this administration’s resolve and its willingness to use innovative approaches to grow the economy … The Volatilian™ believes that the Philippines has a real chance of becoming an Asian Economic Lion”. [7 Oct. 2016. Investors ignore lame-stream media].“From the top down, this administration’s determination to build an expansive economy from which every strata of society will benefit as an active stakeholder should not be underestimated. Nor too should the abilities of Duterte and his team of architects. Investors who do that, not just miss the point, they’ll miss the boat”. [18 Oct. 2016. East meets West in Asian superfamily].“Investors, take note! Contrary to much of what’s been described in the foreign media, the Philippines is a sound funds destination for overseas companies wanting to expand their manufacturing bases and the reach of their brands”. [1 Nov. 2016. Investment advice: ignore the doomsayers].“And so if (the “Golden Age of Infrastructure”) is handled properly, for the Philippine regions the next five-something years could also turn out to be the “Golden Age of Investment”. [10 Mar. 2017. Bumps in the road].“Despite strenuous efforts by opponents of President Rodrigo Duterte to make the case that the Philippine economy is suffering under his leadership, economic indicators point in a very different direction. They show that both growth prospects and confidence remain high – actually they’re bullish”. [31 Mar. 2017. Philippines in bull territory].“The economic-failure argument of the government’s detractors is now looking beyond hopeless … So the real picture of the Philippine economy – both now and throughout the immediate term of this government – is very different indeed to the one regularly being shown by Duterte’s political opponents. [20 Apr. 2017. IMF vote of confidence].“The positive picture … stands in stark contrast to the dystopian view we get from the Western press”. [10 May 2017. More economic endorsements].“The picture for investment in the Philippines looks increasingly bullish … the country’s investment climate looks bright”. [5 Jul. 2017. As a matter of fact…].",

    "body": "According to a CNN report, the average cost of treatment for dengue is at more than P18,000 per patient. In 2016, the Philippines was the first country where the vaccine Dengvaxia to fight Dengue was made commercially available.The vaccination program was launched during President B. S. Aquino’s administration just before the 2016 elections which raised questions why there was a rush to implement the project.During a House of Representatives’ Health Committee last year, former Health Secretary Dr. Paulyn Ubial found it unusual that program started just before the 2016 presidential elections.Ubial also wondered why the DOH under former DOH Secretary Dr. Janette Garin targeted a million children for vaccination right away when such programs start with a target of 20,000 to 30,000 children.According to Ubial “Usually, we don’t do new introductions together with a major national event.”The risky P3.5 billion on the immunization programIn a November 30, 2017 report by CNN, it wrote that the pharmaceutical company Sanofi admitted that new clinical data analysis showed its dengue vaccine is more risky for people who have not been infected with dengue. This means that the vaccine is only risk-free if you have been infected by dengue already.Sanofi said that “For those not previously infected by dengue virus, however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection.”In 2016, the Philippines became the first country to implement the use of Dengvaxia through a school-based dengue immunization program, which initially covered Grade 4 students in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, and CALABARZON (Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Quezon).Goodbye P3.5 billion vaccineThe Department of Health (DOH) spent P3.5 billion on the immunization program, a move questioned by some doctors as Dengvaxia had not yet been approved by the World Health Organization then.During the Duterte administration, the program was halted in 2016 by then Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial to await the results of the pilot program.Health authorities earlier said the vaccine would have side effects, including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, redness and swelling.Thank you, President Rody Duterte administration for putting an end to this and someone should be punished for pushing a vaccination program that was not approved by the World Health Organization at that time.",

Arroyo said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown awesome leadership and resolve in the many programs that he promised to do during his presidency.”“In his first year, he managed to institute various bold reforms against illegal drugs and corruption. His Build, Build, Build initiative is commendable and is a step in the right direction towards achieving inclusive growth.”Arroyo’s government was marred by numerous controversies in regard to electoral cheating and alleged cases of corruption. However, that did not stop her from once again being voted into a position of power. For the former president, President Duterte managed to inspire and unite the Filipino people. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo stated:“More than his accomplishments in his work as President, President Duterte has achieved to inspire and unite the Filipino people towards his goal of effecting real change for the country. I wish him success and the best of health for the rest of his term as he fulfills his mandate for the nation and for the people.”Shortly after winning the presidential election, Duterte began to develop a close relationship with former president Arroyo. He also appointed many of her former subordinates to office and occasionally seeks her counsel. He also often invites her to official gatherings.Meanwhile, Former Senator Bongbong Marcos, Jr., a known ally of the president, also lauded Duterte for being a “good leader” and establishing an “important position” of the country in the international community. He said:“President Rodrigo Duterte has shown one singular quality that is very clear and the reason why he is very popular–the quality of leadership. For example, he has redirected our foreign policy and that is the reason why we have regained once again a crucial and important position in the international community to the benefit of the Philippines. It is the same with various domestic policies.”The former senator also said that Filipinos recognize the president’s efforts. Bongbong stated:“Only a good leader can do that and he managed to do just that.”",

Sabi niya sa akin, ‘Bahala ka, malaki ka na. I trust your judgment. Alam naman niya nasa akin na yun, kahit walang tukso, kung gagawa ako ng paraan. Kilala naman niya ako,” he said.The actor even expressed his sincerity towards his wife by declaring that he wants them to be together forever.“Wish ko siyempre forever na… sana hanggang sa mamatay na. Yun naman ang wish ng kahit sinong mag-asawa, di ba?” Veneracion said.Veneracion, however, admitted that he still gets attracted to other women despite this; and this is because it’s just normal for a man to do so.“Oo naman, alam naman ‘yan ng asawa ko. Alam naman lahat ng asawa ko na I appreciate… As an artist, as a painter, as an actor, I appreciate beauty,” he admitted.When asked whom he wants to paint, he immediately answered: “Si Liza Soberano.”“Napakaganda ng mukha, napakaganda ng aura. Siyempre nakaka-appreciate ako ng beauty, kahit sino namang may asawa. The fact na nag-asawa ka, ibig sabihin nun ay naa-appreciate mo ang female beauty,” he explained.Veneracion also shared a comical conversation between him and his children regarding his career; he revealed that they often joke about his cuteness on projects.Kunyari, nakakita sila ng billboard sa Bench sa Edsa, nadadaanan namin.“Grabe, Dad, pa-cute ka diyan, pa-cute ka!’“Ako naman, ‘Hayaan niyo na, hayaan niyo na, tumatanda na nga, hayaan niyo na akong magpa-cute.’“So, ayun, tawanan lang kami,” he said.",

Prior to her breakout role in the 2010 Philippine television drama “Trudis Liit,” the child star was in a TV ad for milk brand Promil. She also played the role of Daldanika in “The Last Prince.”Jillian’s mother is half-Filipina and half-American, and it shows in Jillian’s slightly mestiza complexion. Recently, her photographs grabbed the attention of netizens who noticed that she is slowly leaving her “Trudis Liit” image behind and transforming into a beautiful pre-teen starlet.Back when Jillian was still starting out in the local showbiz scene, a lot of her supporters and fans adored her for being an elegant and classy fashionista despite being so young. And now that she has hit puberty, Jillian has shown that she is ready to take her career and her style to the next level.Aside from acting, Jillian Ward is also interested in singing. See what she looks like below.Although the showbiz industry is often competitive and taxing, Jillian has managed to stand out among her peers. She is currently part of the primetime series “Super Ma’am” as one of her students named Michelle Ombrero. The show stars Kapuso Primetime Queen Marian Rivera in the lead role. Jillian can also be seen every Sunday on the youth-oriented show titled “Daig Kayo ng Lola Ko.”See more photos of her below.We all know that child stars are not going to be cute little children forever. There are a number of published articles about child actors and actresses who grew up and are now recognized as beautiful or handsome grown-ups. It seems that Jillian Ward is growing into her own as well.Here are the comments from the netizens:What can you say about Jillian Ward hitting puberty?

    "body": "IMPORTANT NOTE: I really do not want to talk about this issue but the attacks have gotten so vicious that it might affect the reputation of my blog among my social media followers and it might also harm the reputation not only of Karambola, but DWIZ as well. Yes, I have to address this before the issue gets out of hand.I initially told myself, “Okay, he just needs to vent, so let him vent.” I watched you disparage the show and the network not only through your profile page, but also through the different social media chat groups, some of which I am also a member of.I tried to be as patient and understanding to you as possible. In one of the chatrooms, I even gently told you:To which, you replied:At that point, I realized, “Wow, he really thinks there's nothing wrong with him.”“I have. The reason given to me was exactly what I said. Leni wanted me out. What is there to introspect? It is weird since it looks like a delayed reaction. I have not been talking about Leni. I did not personally attack her. In any case thanks for the reminder.”I asked Jojo if that's true, and he said it's not. I found out that you just cherry-picked that statement and disregarded everything else that he said.The problem: the Leni thing constitutes a very small portion of what Jojo really told you.I kept my silence in spite of that, out of my respect for the more senior co-producers. I was made a co-producer of the show before you got disinvited.The problem, however, is that you allowed your diva-hood to get the better of you when you used your Manila Times column to bring the drama to a whole new level. I do not know if you named names in your column, but let's not kid ourselves: we all know who and what you're talking about.So I apologize if I didn't read your article-rant in its entirety because simply reading the title made me vomit my innards.But one of my long-time OFW readers did and she messaged me about it. She said:It's sickeningly juvenile, Professor, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I have become a co-producer of the show and I don't like the way you disparage the show's and the station's respective reputations.This will be the last time that I will talk about this issue, and I leave it to the public to decide who's telling the more believable version of events.“Fired”?You weren't fired because firing you requires the existence of an employee-employer relationship vis-a-vis the Karambola sa DWIZ radio show, a relationship that is non-existent because there is no contract between you and anybody in Karambola's management or that of the radio station.In short, you were Karambola's regular guest.That is, when one of the show's heads, veteran journalist Jojo A. Robles, told you that he was “letting you go”, he meant he was disinviting you from the show.Yes, the operative word here is not “termination”, but “disinvitation”.That is, Karambola simply withdrew your invitation to be a guest. Nothing more, nothing less.Yes, Prof. Conteraras, you were disinvited, just like what the President did to VP Leni Robredo in Malacanang's vin d'honneur earlier in January [Now, some people may be asking why you weren't offered a contract. That's a fair question. Well, the hosts told me that you weren't offered a contract because they feared that you're one gigantic drama queen. That is, Karambola simply withdrew your invitation to be a guest. Nothing more, nothing less.Yes, Prof. Conteraras, you were disinvited, just like what the President did to VP Leni Robredo in Malacanang's vin d'honneur earlier in January [ SunStar ].Now, some people may be asking why you weren't offered a contract. That's a fair question. Well, the hosts told me that you weren't offered a contract because they feared that you're one gigantic drama queen.It's safe to say that after your week-long-and-still-ongoing-and-still-intensifying rants, those fears are not unfounded.Now that that has been clarified, let's answer the next logical question: “Why were you disinvited?”You fail at instrospection, professor, so let me do the introspection for you.\"Disinvitation\" I do not know if you yourself claimed that your anti-Leni Robredo stance caused your disinvitation, but it appears that most netizens believe that Leni tried to find ways to kick you out of it.That is mostly incorrect.I have spoken with the team and while it is true that someone in management raised the issue of your unabashed hatred for Robredo, that in itself is not reason enough for them to let you go. I myself love criticizing Robredo, perhaps as much as you do, yet they decided to invite me to the team.Leni or no Leni, the decision to disinvite you from the show came even before I entered the picture. You see, the show's producers have been planning to disinvite you months before that fateful Monday morning. It was not because of any new development, but because of chronic issues that the shows' hosts and the station's management found, issues that adversely affect the quality of the show's content.The most senior producer talked to you that morning to deliver the bad news as gently as possible. He said he's at least giving you the rest of the week so you won't be embarrassed. You said you'll just leave right then and there, and the producer thought the matter has been settled and it's time to just move on for both sides.The show did not announce your exit and you weren't even prevented to make up an alibi to explain your exit. For one, you could have just told the public that you decided to leave the show because of scheduling issues and got the entire thing over with.But no, you announced your \"termination\" minutes before the live stream, exposing us to a barrage of angry comments that lasted the entire show.No, Prof. Tonton, that isn't how grown-ups behave. Yes, I myself am childish at times, but you're older than I am: you should know better.The problem is that you don't.SpecificsYou know what, I was the one who defended you as they were mulling your disinvitation. But they have become so sick and tired of you that no amount of defending could have saved your neck. But “sick and tired” is too vague a term, so let me list down the specific reasons one by one.First, Pre-show Prep Issues There was a general impression that you do not perform sufficient pre-show preparation. There have been many times when your comments on particular issues consist basically of motherhood statements that provide little value to the listener. While complete mastery of every new political issue is not expected, the show's producers expect commentators to give insights that occasionally elicit “Ay, oo nga no!?” from listeners.For example, there have been more than a few instances where co-host Conrad Banal interrupted you with snarky comments. Those snarky comments were subtle instructions for you to level up your game. The problem, however, is that you weren't able to take the hint despite being a year into the show.Second, Credentialism You also have a penchant for resorting to credentialism when you run out of motherhood statements to blurt out. You love to shamelessly invoke your “academic background”, which in effect tells the audience that they have to believe you regardless of how insipid your commentary is. That's just like ABS-CBN News insisting that they're credible just because they wont this and that award.But the problem is further exacerbated by your unnecessary penchant for jargon. Professor, our audience do not have formal training in the social sciences, so you have to speak in a language that they readily understand. You don't do that.Third, Hijacking Topics Your peers in the show also felt selfishness on your part whenever you hijack topics. Take, for example, the time when you changed the topic from the Marawi Clash to e-Jeepneys. I mean, come on, e-Jeepneys? The hosts were trying to bring back the topic to Marawi, but you interrupted them so much and so often that they weren't able to. For almost half an hour, we were forced to listen about your thing with e-Jeepneys as we watched the Facebook Live viewer count plunge like Leni Robredo's Trust Ratings.You know why Conrad sometimes suddenly talks about economics? It's to shut you up, because the show's hosts notice that you talk less when economics is the topic. That's how bad the situation has become.Fourth, Airtime Hogging Despite the previous two points, you chose to airtime hog: you love listening to yourself too much. There have been more than a few occasions where you did 5-minute monologues without allowing anyone among the co-hosts to talk. It would have been acceptable if those were 5 minutes worth of mind-boggling insights, but they weren't.Haven't you noticed those episodes when Jojo or Conrad or Jonat barely talked for an entire segment? It's because of you. Worse, you don't even let anybody speak while you're in between thoughts, and you do this by repeating sentences over and over until your brain catches up with your mouth.Fifth, Egotism Another issue that everyone raised was your humongous ego. While egotism in itself is not necessarily bad, your ego has adversely affected the quality of discussion in Karambola. Karambola has slowly become more toxic because of it, and the show's hosts managed to mitigate the toxicity only by getting out of your way. But the show is called Karambola: a monologue is no karambola.Take, for example, that time when we criticized ABS-CBN/ANC's editorial decision-making when they chose to pit Jover Laurio with a peripheral figure to the #CocoyGate issue. You did not let us expound on how she broke the law and instead forced the conversation to focus on Jover's penchant for name-calling. Your contention that her calling you a “balahura” is important may be true, but it surely is less important than Laurio violating the Revised Penal Code.Sixth, Sense of Entitlement This bears repeating: you were just a regular guest. Despite this, you usurped editorial control by inviting other people to substitute for you when you're out of town. That's just like lending someone your precious car, only for that person to lend it to someone else without even asking for your permission.Professor Ton, do not give to others what does not belong to you.Seventh, Sub-optimal Ratings A radio show costs serious money to produce and broadcast and just like TV shows, ratings decide the fate of the show. You were brought into Karambola because you had a relatively massive online following. I have spoken with the show's hosts and they said it's the primary reason why you were invited to the show. The problem, however, is that your following did not translate into significantly better ratings.The numbers speak for themselves.Eighth, Integrity Issue One of the show's hosts even told me that you said months ago that your close friend Joyce Ramirez can help bring in sponsorship deals to the show, a sort-of promise that never materialized. What's more interesting, however, are your constant efforts to “reconcile” me with Joyce, something that I cannot imagine will happen.You offered, in multiple occasions and with the other hosts as witnesses, to organize a meeting with Joyce and me so we can patch things up. What I do not understand, however, is what we should patch up.MyI specifically remember that time when I spoke with Joyce's post-Roxas politician-client and warned him of my article that would be published days later because I hate dealing collateral damage. At the end of the day, nobody cares about where you're from: what they care about is the quality of your ideas.But the problem is further exacerbated by your unnecessary penchant for jargon. Professor, our audience do not have formal training in the social sciences, so you have to speak in a language that they readily understand. You don't do that.Your peers in the show also felt selfishness on your part whenever you hijack topics. Take, for example, the time when you changed the topic from the Marawi Clash to e-Jeepneys. I mean, come on, e-Jeepneys? The hosts were trying to bring back the topic to Marawi, but you interrupted them so much and so often that they weren't able to.

What's more interesting, however, are your constant efforts to “reconcile” me with Joyce, something that I cannot imagine will happen.You offered, in multiple occasions and with the other hosts as witnesses, to organize a meeting with Joyce and me so we can patch things up. What I do not understand, however, is what we should patch up.My #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy articles reported about the duplicity of the Liberal Party and Joyce Ramirez, and I do not understand how a meeting with Joyce will correct what she has already allegedly done.I specifically remember that time when I spoke with Joyce's post-Roxas politician-client and warned him of my article that would be published days later because I hate dealing collateral damage.Yes, we're talking about the same Joyce Ramirez who allegedly headed LP-Akbayan black propaganda social media campaigns, where Mar Roxas reportedly tried to pin all the blame over Mamasapano on PNoy just to salvage his 2016 presidential ambitions.Right after I said that, you brazenly ordered me, right in front of that politician's face and with several other people as witnesses, that I should stop writing against Joyce Ramirez.We were all stunned. Who are you to censor my blog? I think even that politician was stunned, as evidenced by the politician's camp reportedly firing Ramirez a few days later.After the article's publication and ensuing brouhaha, Ramirez reportedly told the politician that she knew of the article's existence days before its publication because you told her about it yourself.Did you divulge confidential information to the exact person who I was about to expose?Tonton, which side are you on? Duterte's side, as long as it's not against PR operator Joyce Ramirez? What do you owe Joyce, really?My little birds told me a few things and many others, but I'd rather not mention them anymore.A Final Word Yes, Professor, I partially agree that your unabashed hatred for Leni Robredo is a factor behind your disinvitation, but that reason was thrown in only because the producers still had enough remaining sympathy for you, enough for them to feel the need to protect your large and fragile ego.They gave you a full year to fix your act, but they felt that you believed that you were so good, you didn't have to get better. They partially agree with you: you did not improve indeed.The producers were hoping that you would exit quietly, just like what everyone did before you. You know why job interviewers interviewers in general reject applicants who trash-talk their previous companies? First, because people generally hate whiny people. Second, because those applicants are likely to do the same thing if and when they leave.Jojo Robles, Conrad Banal, Mon Tulfo, and many other bigger radio and TV celebrities were once fired from their stations, but they had the decency to avoid whining about it. Instead, they just moved on and looked for better opportunities elsewhere.But unlike them, you had to whine like a child who's got his candy stolen.Professor Tonton, you are years older than I am, and people expect you to display an EQ that's at least higher than a 32-year-old's.With these said, will you choose to finally show some grace in adversity, or will you continue to whine until kingdom come?It's up to you but if choose the latter, do us a favor by not whining in front of PR operator Joyce Ramirez, your dear friend.I have spoken to the show's producers about it and they said that in keeping with media tradition, they will not utter a word. But I am TP: I do not share the same level of fortitude as my co-producers.You can whine till kingdom come but I'm sorry, you are not the most important topic on earth.Please, Professor Contreras, let this be the last of it.That's all I have to say about the matter. [ That's all I have to say about the matter. [ DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Follow @iMRELATED POSTS:That is, to set things straight, let me tell you my version of the story behind your leaving Karambola sa DWIZ.",

We can work to correct submissions if you’d like to use the feedback form, but due to the volume of submissions, corrections can take some time to accommodate.Where can I see a picture of the chip being sent on InSight?An image of the final chip will be put on the InSight/Send your name to Mars pages, and the InSight Mission website.Where can I see a list of names being sent on InSight?We do not publish the final list of names. All names are reviewed prior to submission on the mission microchip.I submitted my name on a previous Mars mission (Mars Science Lab, MAVEN, Mars Exploration Rovers).Do I get frequent flyer points from that?Participants prior to the Orion first test flight received a certificate of participation at the time they submitted. The Frequent Flyer program started with the Orion first test flight in 2014.Who sees my name and email address?All names are reviewed by a team of people at NASA and then sent to the microchip manufacturer. Your email is only used to allow you to track your Frequent Flyer participation, and to receive a notification when the next Send Your Name to Mars event occurs.

    "body": "Russia has released 17 illegally-recruited overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) briefly detained by authorities on May 16, an apparent display of goodwill ahead of President Duterte’s visit to Moscow next week.In a statement, Philippine Ambassador to the Russia Carlos Sorreta said 14 of those detained were released on Wednesday. He issued an update on his Facebook page on Friday and said the remaining three have also been released.“In our discussion with Russian authorities, we emphasized that the detainees are victims and not criminals. They are victims of illegal recruitment and should not be punished. They should be set free,” Sorreta said in a statement.“Filipinos in Russia obey the law, are hardworking and do not cause problems. There is also a lot of goodwill between the Philippines and Russia today, with increasing prospects for cooperation in a wide range of areas. These factors helped us in securing the release of our Filipinos,” he said.President Duterte will fly to Russia next week for a ‘landmark visit’ where he is expected to push for stronger defense and trade relations.Last month, Duterte boarded a Russian warship for the second time and said: “The Russians are with me, so I should not be afraid.”The Philippine Embassy is currently working to see if the released OFWs would still be able to continue with their employment in Russia. If they will not be allowed, the embassy will help them go back to the Philippines.“We would like to advice those seeking to work in Russia to follow both Philippine and Russia laws. For those already here, please continue to observe the laws of the country, be respectful to lawful authorities and do not call attention to yourselves,” Sorreta said. (source)Commentscomments",

He wanted so bad to be rich and so he tried a lot of businesses but most of them failed. Henry then taught of another business and an idea crossed his mind. The young businessman dreamed of having a small shoe store.Getting customers has been a struggle for him but he noticed that Mercury Drug, which has been in the business for so many years, has many customers coming in and out of their store so Henry approached the owner and asked if he can rent and place his small show store there even in a small space. Unfortunately, the owner declined his request.Loading...With this incident, Henry promised himself that he should no longer let himself be embarrassed and promised to never let Mercury Drug step into his life in the future, once he become rich.In 1958, Mr. Sy made his dream a reality with an established shoe store in Quiapo, Manila, the 1st ever SM Mall in November 1972.Loading...Looking back, you couldn’t imagine that the richest man in the Philippines suffered from this terrible incident that maybe triggered him to strive more.Now, because of his determination and persistence, he is now owner of numerous malls, super malls and supermarkets in the country and owns 6 malls in China and 1 SM Mall in Guam.",

The sacredness (of the mosques) is gone as the Maute used these in their military activities,” said Lt. Col. Jo-ar Herrera, the spokesperson of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division.“As you can see they are making these (mosques) as their logistical hub and snipers’ nest,” he added.He said as long as the terrorists were using the mosques as snipers’ nest, these would be targeted “in order to save lives and in order to protect our troops.”“Those identified enemy battle positions, they are targeted for surgical airstrikes so that we can gain foothold. That’s the development on the ground so that our men can advance in the inner heart of Marawi,” he said.He said that as of Tuesday (June 13), high profile targets, Omar and Abdullah Maute, and Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, were still inside Marawi leading their men.But sources said on Monday, that Abdullah Maute has become the highest ranking leader of the armed militants in Marawi now in command due to the absence of Isnilon Hapilon — believed to be the IS emir in the Philippines — from the war zone.The same sources said every morning, Abdullah would go around their stronghold areas in the city aboard a pickup truck to marshal his forces to fight on.Commentscomments",

Ayon sa Fred Clipres para sa DZMM, natagpuan ang pugad ng ipinagbabawal na droga sa unang palapag ng isang bahay sa 1870 Guanzon Street sa Barangay 31, habang ang ikalawang palapag nito ay ginagamit din umanong sambahan ng isang grupong Kristiyano. Naaresto sa raid ang caretaker na si Danilo Lanyohan matapos ang halos dalawang linggong pagmamanman ng mga operatiba ng Station Anti Illegal Drugs ng Manila Police District Station 10. Sa panayam ng DZMM kay Supt. Emerey Abating, team leader ng grupong nagsagawa ng raid, napag-alaman na isinasabay ni Lanyohan ang pagluluto ng shabu sa pagluluto naman ng mga Peking duck at lechon de leche na siyang negosyo ng may-ari ng bahay. “Medyo mailap (ang suspek) kasi kailangan kilala ka muna niya bago ka makapasok sa loob ng bahay,” ayon sa opisyal. Mariin namang itinanggi ni Lanyohan na pugad nga ng ilegal na droga ang nasabing tirahan. “Hindi po ito drug den, hindi naman po madalas na gumagamit dito,” anito. Subalit iginiit ng isang opisyal ng barangay na marami silang nakikitang mga tao na labas-masok sa bahay tuwing gabi. Sumuko na rin umano dati si Lanyohan sa “Oplan Tokhang” at dalawang beses na itong dumalo sa programa ng barangay para sa mga ‘drug surrenderees’. Noong Agosto, isang drug den din ang nadiskubre ng mga awtoridad sa ilalim ng tulay sa Binondo; ilang metro lang ang layo sa isang Police Community Precinct (PCP) sa may Juan Luna Street. Ang pagkakatuklas sa naturang ‘drug den’ ay nauwi sa pagkakasibak sa puwesto ng hepe ng nasabing presinto.Source]Loading...So what can you say about this one?

JR Quiñahan then, iced the game from the charity stripe.“It was exactly what we expected, a hard earned win for us,” said NLEX head coach Yeng Guiao.Kiefer Ravena, the second overall pick by NLEX, proved to be good as advertised as he flirted with a triple-double with 18 points, 12 assists, seven rebounds with two steals to boot in his PBA debut.Kevin Alas came off the bench and added 14 markers and five boards, Michael Miranda got 14 points and two rebounds, and Alex Mallari had 13 markers and three boards in a balanced attack for the Road Warriors.Fonacier shot 3-of-5 from beyond the arc to wind up with 12 points and four rebounds, while Quiñahan and Rabeh Al-Hussaini combined for 24 markers and 15 boards in the win.“We’ll take this win no matter how hard it was,” said Guiao, as NLEX had to fight from behind and even stared at a 13-point lead at numerous points in the second quarter. “What we’re trying to do here is build momentum and confidence and chemistry in the team.”NLEX discard Eric Camson sizzled in the game against his former squad as he went for a team-best 24 points on a 9-of-19 shooting on top of nine rebounds for Kia.New recruit Rashawn McCarthy contributed 14 markers, six boards, and five assists, while Jackson Corpuz got 13 points and nine rebounds in the defeat.The scores:NLEX 119 — Ravena 18, Miranda 14, Alas 14, Mallari 13, Fonacier 12, Al-Hussaini 12, Quiñahan 12, Tiongson 11, Baguio 5, Soyud 4, Ighalo 4, Taulava 0.KIA 115 — Camson 24, McCarthy 14, Corpuz 13, Reyes 12, Galanza 12, Celda 9, Ababou 9, Khobuntin 8, Paniamogan 7, Tubid 4, Yee 3, Caperal 0.Quarters: 36-40, 64-68, 90-92, 119-115.",

Duterte’s message was clear. He wanted to have peace with the rebels but the NPA seemed unapologetic and hard-headed. They continue to attack even the President Security Group vehicles while the peace talk in Netherlands was on-going.

The photos came from a reliable source, a government official in the city, who sought to express the trauma the people of Marawi were experiencing. Before we could complete the verification process (including having another reporter call the source and doing a reverse-image search), we posted all five photos.That was a mistake, and we apologize unreservedly. Two of the photos were taken down around noon, when we double-checked with the source, and the rest were removed around 1 pm, when even the source’s assurances could no longer be supported. We regret not moving fast enough to correct the mistake.We regret even more that this mistake cast a shadow over the reporting that the entire Inquirer Group put into the coverage of both the siege and the subsequent declaration of martial law. Those print, online, social, and radio stories were the best obtainable version of the truth at the time we reported them.Moving forward, we will review our procedures and impose the necessary sanctions to make sure that this mistake will not happen again, even as we remain committed to cover the developing story as best we can.Read Here : The posted fake news Inquirer Nagbalita ng Maling Photo Hinggil sa Sitwasyon sa Marawi CityCommentscomments",

It’s impossible, what they’re doing, in terms of having a positive impact.”A coalition of environmental and health groups including Équiterre, the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) and the Canadian Environmental Law Association issued a news release urging Canada to follow the lead of other countries with stronger measures against neonicotinoids, also called neonics.“Italy banned neonic seed treatments on corn in 2008; France will phase out all neonics to protect pollinators starting next year. Parallel comprehensive action is needed in Canada to protect pollinators, ecosystems and food security,” it reads.Mass bee deathsAfter beekeepers started reporting mass deaths of honeybees, scientists began to zero in on neonics as one of the causes.Bees were consuming pollen contaminated with neonics and were also flying through clouds of dusts filled with the chemicals in farm fields.Stakeholders and the public will have 90 days to weigh in on the proposed regulations.Deborah Conlon, a representative of the Grain Growers of Ontario, said measures already implemented, including labelling changes, have led to a decrease in bee mortality.She called it “good news” that growers will be able to use the products to protect their crops because an all-out ban could have a big financial impact on farmers.“Insects cause damage, and that impacts yield,” she said.A bee gathers nectar from an orange blossom. After beekeepers started reporting mass deaths of honeybees, scientists began to zero in on neonics as one of the causes. (Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images)Lindsey Ehman, a spokeswoman for Grain Growers of Canada, said modern grain farmers “utilize a diverse and innovative toolbox of crop protection products, including neonicotinoids.”Ehman said clothianidin and thiamethoxam “are not expected to affect bees,” when used as a seed treatment — a view many environmental organizations dispute.“Grain Growers of Canada and our members support a strong science-based regulatory system to provide ongoing reviews of crop protection products,” Ehman said. “It is crucial that the Pest Management Regulatory Agency is well resourced to maintain its standing as one of the top regulatory agencies in the world.”",

However, Vice President Leni Robredo questioned why it has a photo of President Rodrigo Duterte.“Agree naman ako sa concerns ng ating mga netizens. Kung tititigan mo nga naming mabuti yung ID, mas malaki pa yung picture ng pangulo sa picture nung may-ari ng ID. Tapos, colored pa yung pangulo, pero black and white naman yung sa may-ari. Parang di naman tama yun, di ba?.” VP Robredo told reporters on Tuesday.(I agree with the concerns of our netizens. If you look closely at the ID, the picture of the president is bigger than that of the owner of the ID. Also, the president’s photo is colored while the owner’s photo is black and white. I think this is not right, is it?)“Akala ko ba, galit siya sa Epal? Naalala ko, pinatanggal nya yung portrait ng mga opisyal ng gobyerno sa mga opisina at pinapalitan niya ng mga portrait ng ating mga bayani.” The vice president added, referring to President Duterte’s memo last September 15, ordering all government agencies to display photos or paintings of heroes instead of elected officials.Last Monday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. has already defended President Duterte, saying that the president really hates Epal (a term referring to a person who is seeking public attention), adding that the latter is most likely not aware that his photo was placed on the OFW ID. Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III also defended the president.“I just want to underscore the concern of the President for the welfare of our workers,” Sec Bello said, adding that more than 100,000 OFW ID cards are ready for distribution but so far, for returning OFWs or Balik Manggagawa (BM) only. Meanwhile, the OFW ID card can already be availed for free via creating an account at iDOLE.ph.Contributed by Salvi Dalida",

It crosses the eastern side of Quezon City, western side of Marikina, western part of Pasig, eastern part of Makati, parts of Taguig, and Muntinlupa.Weak, poorly designed, and poorly constructed buildings far from the earthquake fault are still vulnerable to destruction.Furthermore, the expected movement of Manila trench in the West Philippine Sea might cause a devastating tsunami in the 14 coastal towns of Pangasinan.“Everyone must learn from the recent effects of the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao del Norte. If a similar event happens in a highly urbanized area, the effects can be more devastating,” Phivolcs director Renato Solidum warned.PDRRMC spokesperson Avenix Arenas also said that Bulacan, Metro Manila up to Southern Luzon will the most quake and tsunami affected areas.Recent studies show that a 32-feet-tsunami could be generated by the upcoming disastrous earthquake. Residents in the coastal areas of the affected areas should prepare anytime for the quake could possibly strike anytime.",

In an article published by ABS-CBN’s entertainment website PUSH, the booming entrepreneur shared a sneak peek of his home featuring exquisite Christmas decorations.Joel Cruz also admitted that ever since he was a little kid, he’s already been fascinated with dashing embellishments. However, her passion was hindered by limited budget – which thankfully made him resourceful and creative.He shared:“Noong bata ako, hindi naman ako gaanong may pera na kapag ako mag-design ng Christmas decoration. Kailangan humingi pa ako ng pera sa mother ko so budget talaga. Ang kinagandahan lang noon natural na artistic ako. Kahit na ordinary lang ang decorations namin napapabongga ko kahit papaano.”“Ewan ko ba kung bakit ako palagi nagco-compare sa malalaking mga bahay, sa mga mayayaman talaga yung ganun. Siguro example nalang sa Christmas tree gusto ko na talaga dati pa na mataas at maganda ang Christmas tree namin. Kaya ngayon na nagkaroon na ako, talagang gusto ko dapat laging maganda ang Christmas tree ko.”Since Joel obviously achieved success in life, he is now free to use his hard-earned money for his desired Christmas decors. According to him, despite having experienced having simple holiday celebrations, he remained thankful and content as long as he spends time with his loving family.He explained:“Mayroon na akong nakakatulong ngayon kasi medyo matrabaho na ang pag-aayos talaga. Pero dati talagang ako lang lahat pero happy ako noon kahit na simple lang. Ibang-iba ang pakiramdam, masaya, excited. Marami akong tao na napapasaya. Pag masaya kasi ang ibang tao doon nag-start yung happiness ko.” “Siyempre yung maka-bonding mo ang family, magkaka-sama kayo. Ang preparations ko medyo bongga talaga. Gusto ko maraming food, magsisimba kami buo ang pamilya, may mga bagong damit pero ang higit sa lahat na importante at pinakamasaya yung magkakasama kaming pamilya na pupunta ng simbahan. Kaya definitely pasko ang pinaka paborito kong panahon sa buong taon.”It is safe to assume that this coming holiday is even more special for the celebrity-entrepreneur as he’s about to celebrate Christmas day together with his third set of twins.What can you say about Joel Cruz’s way of celebrating Christmas holiday?

    "body": "The year 2017 has so far seen its share of demonstrations of various scales and from pro- and anti-administration sides of the political fence, but for a former lawmaker, protest actions against President Rodrigo Duterte are only bound to get bigger in 2018.Former Bayan Muna party-list representative Neri Colmenares on Wednesday said he sees “larger rallies and protest actions in 2018 especially since President Duterte has not fulfilled his promises.”And it may not just be the usual set of protesters that will be opposing the President in the coming year, Duterte’s second at the helm of the Philippine government.“Maraming mga lawyers na before hindi ganun ka-vocal, pero ngayon sabi nila sobra na ‘to. So I’m sure there are many lawyers, and not just lawyers, many people, many sectors, the Church, or even business for that matter or professionals na medyo hindi na sila sang-ayon sa nangyayaring kaguluhan ngayon,” Colmenares said.Duterte, to recall, ran for and eventually won the presidency on a platform that reflected supposed disdain for illegal drugs and corruption, among others, which all apparently resonated with the 16 million Filipinos who voted for him in May 2016.But Colmenares said a part of Duterte’s base of supporters may now be “disenchanted,” since the Chief Executive has allegedly fallen short of ending contractualization, addressing land distribution, and achieving an independent foreign policy.“…Lahat ‘yan ng pangako niya will cause disenchantment even to his supporters,” he said.Lawyer Homobono Adaza, for his part, said he sees “sunrise” in 2018, but former Defense Secretary Norberto Gonzales said this “sunrise” will only be possible if a “feasible opposition” will arise.“[The] main difficulty [is] there are no alternatives that are popularly appreciated. Kasi mga alternatives natin ang more on the level of…hindi nakikita ng marami, may mga…parties; movements are there pero walang nagri-rise na pwedeng mag-galvanize ng protest,” he said.“Sunrise is possible if a feasible opposition will show up,” he added.Jigs Clamor, deputy secretary general of militant rights watchdog group Karapatan, said he is expecting a “worsened” human rights situation in the country in the coming year.Colmenares agreed, saying Duterte’s recent pronouncements, including the terror tag for the Communist Party of the Philippines – New People’s Army, and the now-Congress-approved Mindanao martial law extension, are targeted toward legal opposition to the President.Earning criticism from opposition lawmakers and non-government groups, Duterte has also openly lambasted government officials from co-equal branches of government, such as Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales and Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, who is now facing an impeachment complaint before the House Committee on Justice.The President has also spoken out against his critics in international bodies such as the United Nations and the European Union.Earlier in the forum, Colmenares called Duterte “intolerant to dissent.” —KG, GMA News",

Some of them appeared on the list for only one or two years. In 2009, 14 personalities were likewise on the list. But in 2010, there were a total of 24.Kris, youngest sister of President Aquino, paid P49.8 million in taxes for the year 2011. Augmenting her income from numerous TV shows and a single film that year (“Segunda Mano”) was a virtual shopping list of product endorsements—from seasonings to petroleum and beauty products. (At the latest count, she has 20 such endorsements.)In third place was “Eat Bulaga” cohost Joey de Leon (28th overall, P12.5 million). Joey endorsed six products—from telecoms to doughnuts—and appeared in two Star Cinema movies in 2011. Joey was not on the 2009 and 2010 list.Filipino-British model, actor, and TV host Derek Ramsay (120th overall, P7.1 million) broke into the top 500 in 2011— having made two films, several TV shows, and four product endorsements.TV and movie hunk Piolo (123rd, P7 million), who endorsed 17 products, made no movies, but regularly appeared on four TV shows in 2011.Like Piolo, Chinese-Filipino actress Kim (133rd, P6.7 million) was a consistent top earner for those three years. She was especially busy on TV in 2011, appearing in five teleseryes and endorsing 17 products.Drama heartthrob John Lloyd (205th, P5.4 million), made no movies and appeared only in one teleserye in 2011 (“Imortal”), but had 16 product endorsements.Rounding up the roster of show biz celebs among 2011’s top 500 were Manny Pacquiao (158th, P6.1 million), Michael V (178th, P5.9 million), Willie Revillame (181st, P5.85 million), Ogie Alcasid (184th, P5.81 million), Sharon Cuneta (191st, P5.7 million), Ryan Agoncillo (194th, P5.6 million), and former president and actor Joseph “Erap” Estrada (490th, P3.5 million).Except for Erap, Michael V, Ogie and Ryan, all of the top celebrity earners appeared on the BIR list from 2009 to 2011.Dropped from listSarah Geronimo, who occupied 261st place in 2009 and 67th spot in 2010, didn’t make it to the 2011 list. The singer-actress-TV host currently endorses 17 products.Marian Rivera was 62nd in 2009 and 86th in 2010. Like Sarah, she did not appear on the 2011 list. Marian endorses 13 products.Other celebrities on the 2010 list but not on the 2011 list were Bea Alonzo, Boy Abunda, KC Concepcion, Dingdong Dantes, Ai-ai de las Alas, Gerald Anderson, Carmina Villaroel, and Chris Tiu.Tax casesControversial film director Carlo J. Caparas was the top celebrity taxpayer in 2010 (P65.6 million), but was nowhere on the 2011 list. And in the eyes of the BIR, Caparas owes the government much more. In 2011, the bureau filed a P102-million tax evasion case against Caparas, stemming from a P1.3-billion contract with the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) to produce two TV shows. The case has yet to be resolved.Boxer, TV host and Sarangani Rep. Pacquiao has also been involved in a legal tussle over his taxes. The BIR filed a case against Pacquiao to compel him to submit tax records in connection with its ongoing probe on his alleged failure to pay the right taxes in 2010. Although the city prosecutor dismissed the case last year, the BIR has filed an appeal.source: inquirer",

The team also allegedly experienced difficulty preparing for the visit days before the bloody clash.At least three were killed and 40 others were injured in a clash with policemen during a rally peasants staged along Kidapawan Highway to ask for the local government’s help in dealing with the El Niño crisis that has cost them their livelihood and left their families hungry.North Cotabato Governor Emmylou Taliño-Mendoza, whom the farmers had sought a dialogue with, is an LP stalwart.Roxas’ rivals such as Vice President Jejomar Binay and Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte have scored the government over the incident, saying the farmers’ demands for assistance should not have been met with violence.source: http://politics.com.ph/Commentscomments",

    "body": "Some senators think former President Benigno Aquino III acted in good faith when he gave the go signal on the purchase of Dengvaxia vaccines.Senator JV Ejercito, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, said it was possible that Aquino was simply “misinformed” about the dengue vaccine issue.“Personally, I think PNoy did it in good faith, to avert dengue outbreak in the future. But it’s the other officials who might have taken advantage and did not give him an extensive report that includes the risk if there was,” Ejercito said in a statement Friday.“My personal take is that not all information was disclosed, so that the transaction will push through. Possible that he was misinformed on the whole dengue vaccine issue,” Ejercito further said.Senator Sherwin Gatchalian echoed the sentiment of Ejercito, saying Aquino, as the chief executive then, relied on his alter egos for accurate information on the dengue vaccine.“It is the responsibility of the alter ego, in this case former secretary (Janette) Garin to meticulously vet any proposals for public health to the president,” Gatchalian said.“Clearly in the hearing, the former secretary gave the former president incomplete information about Dengvaxia which made him decide to conduct massive immunization among children,” he added.Senator Joel Villanueva, for his part, said that while accountability should be determined, he believes the former President “acted in the best interest of the people.”“I stand by President Noy, given the circumstances, information and research given and available to him, he acted in the best interest of our people,” Villanueva said on his social media account.Aquino, together with former Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr. and former Budget secretary Florencio “Butch” Abad, faced the Senate blue ribbon committee probe on the Dengvaxia controversy Thursday.Aquino said no one protested then when his administration decided to purchase the vaccines.“Kung ‘di lumabas itong sinabi ng Sanofi, at nagdesisyon akong hayaan na lang na magdusa pa ang mga boss ko, gayong may bakuna na, palagay ko ngayon, iba ang tanong ninyo at asunto sa ‘kin: Bakit mo pinabayaan ang Pilipino?” the former President said.Aquino also said that he was told that the vaccine went through “local and international processes.”The DOH has stopped the use of Dengvaxia after Sanofi, the manufacturer of the vaccines, said results of a recent study showed it can actually put at risk people who have not been previously exposed to the disease.At least least 830,000 students have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia in Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Metro Manila, and Cebu. —KG, GMA News",

    "body": "SUPALPAL TALAGA: OFW debates with Honti- during her visit to SydneyLotti Splendor, an Australian based Filipina bravely stood up during the visit of Lea Salonga with the Filipino community in Sydney on March 22, 2017.Splendor was not satisfied with Honti- 'answer to the question of Mr. Rod Dingle, a co-participant of Splendor during the event. The question was \"Recently, the European Union had voiced concerns about things going on back in the Philippines. How can we as members of the international community assure the international community that all is well in the Philippines?\"Here's the answer hontiveros:Thank you sir Rod. I think, I think, sorry, I think the best assurance and the best way that we can assure our fellow citizens of the world, especially, you are, you are Filipinos living abroad and they have more direct access to you for example here Australia than to us who live in the Philippines.I suppose the best way that you can reassure them either that things are well or that we are constantly trying to improve the situation, we never give up that hope and that dedication to continually improve our situation as a people is first of all just to show them and I'm sure you're already a witness to that, that we just like any other people, we value the common values of human worth and the dignity of every person, mutual respect for each other, that is the effort to continually address not just political but also economic and social means and problems of Filipinos wherever we are and in whatever country we make our new home. I'm sure it's very evident to them how we are diligent and extract the work ethic, how we contribute continually to the economy back home but to our second home, our new countries, by our very high work ethic and the productivity that we contribute to whatever sector or industry we have in place ourselves in those countries.I know also that one way that the international community keeps picking up signals from us that we are continually working on our problems is, for example, just the high and sustained volunteerism, collaboration that we always show every ordinary day and even under the worst circumstances like after Yolanda, or HaiYan, that we showed how, no matter how challenging conditions are changing in the whole planet, when the Filipinos, when the need is even greater, we lean back together to help each other. So these are some of the ways I think that we can reassure or us, we can tell other peoples that regardless of our political, economic and social challenges, that we never let go of trying to find the best possible solutions. Even when the conversation becomes difficult, that we're always trying to debate with each other if we need to in a mutually respectful manner. So I do not think they can do any better than that. And if we can do that and we can do that more and more, as time goes by, then they will realize again, as they realized at this point that we are a people just like them.Gorgeousness then proceeded asking a follow up question:\"... You were demanding that the President allows the UN to come into the Philippines and investigate. Where is the honor in that? How can we be honorable when we malign our own community, our own people, in suggesting that there are crimes going on done by the government against its own people. it's not fair that we have to struggle to change the image of Filipinos and the Philippines in the international community and yet repeatedly we hear you politicians that being down you must own country. we have been affected, the affected workers. we are around the world and we all have to put up with that and we all have to, we're at the forefront in other words, in the frontier we are before us, we are really in the trenches dealing with foreigners seen saying as you senators. you hold office okay? So people will listen to you whether we like it or not. So, how do we change images, if repeatedly destroyed by our fellow Filipinos? ... \"This is the continuation of the verbal tussle of Splendor and hontiveros:Risa: Thank you Miss Charles. If you read my statement I am again, I did not demand President. Who urge. And it was there in response to the comment with VP Leni who, what, to mislead the UN or other international observers, especially from the perspectivesLotti: They were.Risa: human rights. Well that is ah, that is arguable, it was a pinagdi-diskursohan us these days.Lotti: Come on!Risa: Oh well let's just agree to disagree, I can respect your opinion about that. So, the word which I chose very deliberately, because, was to urge, to urge the government. And those deaths, those dead compatriots of ours, they are by the Philippine National Police's own statistics. Ah, more than half of them recorded as killed during a police anti-drug operations andLotti: That's not what the stats say, though.Risa: Yes, yes, that's what the police's statistics show. And uhm, about three, uh, three-fifths of the stats at any one time from the police, deaths due to anti-drug operations, and about two-fifths of those, what they call DUI, deaths under investigation, including those attributed to vigilante groups. So uh, and so as citizens, and I know because I'm a police widow, as citizens, even those deaths under investigation which was attributed to vigilante groups who take advantage of the government's war on drugs to commit their killings and sweep them under the cover of the anti-drug war, even those DUI which is what the police also calls them, uh, people look to the police at least to investigate, so that the families left behind, the survivors can seek justice if they believe that their family member was wrongfully killed. So when the comment was these international groups were misled which is arguable, therefore I said then if that is what the government believes, then I urge them to invite those groups to conduct the investigation. All those groups can not come in unless invited by government.Lotti: Thank God for that!Risa: (Laughs) Well, that was the spirit of my statement urging the government. And it is, with all due respect also, it's not vandalism. It's an attempt as a legislator, we are a separate and co-equal branch of government, to call the attention of the Executive, or at times, of the Judiciary, to when we think that the Executive is not implementing a law properly, or the Judiciary is misinterpreting it on constitutional grounds, and the other branches do that to us also, the judiciary checks us other two, the other two executive checks us and so on and so forth. And so, as a member of a separate and co-equal branch of government when I see something that may need correction or a gap that may need filling, it's my duty, it's my work for which I was elected to work in the Senate, it's my mandate, meaning, it's an order from the voters to me that I should point it out. And I'd like to say that I really take pains that when I point something out, I do not leave it at that. I try to study the issue further and propose an alternative. That's why there are also, as I was discussing with Sir Rado earlier, some proposals I'm making in terms of how to more effectively and cost-efficiently address our problem with illegal drugs, how to support the police in its security center reforms process . So that's what I can say, that uh, I'm trying to do my job as a legislator, and as a Filipino uh.Lotti: Did you call for TokHang to stop?Risa: Yes, I did, during ...Consul-Gen: Ah, Charles there are others raising their hand.Watch video below:Disclaimer: Contributed articles does not reflect the view of .org.

    "body": "House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez is confident that Congress will approve President Rodrigo Duterte's request for a one-year extension of martial law in Mindanao, saying there is factual basis for the extension.However, minority senators are determined on putting their objections on record.Senate Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon on Tuesday, December 12, said Drilon noted that majority of the members of both houses of Congress are allied with the President.\"It is expected that notwithstanding our reservations and opposition, the Congress will authorize the extension of martial for one year in the entire Mindanao, as requested by the President.So we will go through the motions. Ultimately the Supreme Court will have to decide on this, whether or not there is, in fact, a factual basis for the extension of martial in the entire Mindanao,\" Drilon said in a statement.Drilon said their objections would be based on constitutional grounds.\"We will raise constitutional issues. There is no armed uprising or actual rebellion, which is a requirement under the constitution for an extension,\" he said.Congress is scheduled to tackle on Wednesday, December 13, Duterte's request for an extension of martial law in Mindano until December 31, 2018.Martial law was declared in Mindanao on May 23, 2017, shortly after fighting broke out between government troops and Maute terrorists in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur.Under the 1987 Constitution, martial law is good only for 60 days. Congress, however, approved before the July 22 expiry of the declaration Duterte's request for an extension until December 31 this year.While Marawi has been liberated and authorities have declared an end to the war , Duterte cited the continued threats posed by other terrorist groups and the communist rebels, whom he also recently branded as terrorists.In his December 8 letter to Congress, Duterte said martial law is needed to \"ensure total eradication of Daesh-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), and the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters, and financiers.\"He said remnants of the Maute group were trying to rebuild their organization by recruiting more people from Maguindanao, Sulu, Basilan and North Cotabato.Alvarez told critics of martial law that he does not see any reason why Congress should deny the president's request.\"Para sa akin na taga-Mindanao, I don't see any reason why hindi pagbibigyan (For me, who is from Mindanao, I don't see any reason why Congress should not approve it),\" Alvarez said.This is Alvarez' message to the critics who say that there is no factual basis for the extension: \"Pumunta sila dun sa Mindanao (Go to Mindanao).\"The Davao-based solon said rebellion and terrorism, which have plagued Mindanao for so long, could end under a martial law regime.Asked by reporters if there is a constitutional impediment to the planned extension, he said: \"Para sa akin, wala kasi hndi naman 'yan aaprubahan kung may problema sa batas (For me, there's none. That won't be approved if it's not legal).\"",

    "body": "Posted by Joker AminadoPosted on Friday, February 14th, 2014In a surprising turn of events, model-stylist Deniece Cornejo finally admitted to having an affair with businessman Cedric Lee.However, upon learning of Deniece’s confession, Cedric Lee has been denying it.On her second interview on Startalk with Heart Evangelista, Cornejo revealed that she had an illicit affair with Cedric Lee, her alleged co-conspirator in the mauling-extortion case of actor-comedian Vhong Navarro in Cornejo’s home on January 22.Cornejo said however, that the moment she told Lee she was going public about their more-than-friendly relationship, Lee apparently did not agree and has been denying their relationship since.Cornejo said she was disappointed and hurt, and thought that there was something there between her and Lee. She said that they even made plans after the alleged incident with Navarro, which included a nice long vacation overseas, so they can get away from all controversy.The model-stylist revealed that she has gotten used to inviting Lee over to her condo unit and having ‘foods’ brought to her by Lee each time, that it was hard for her to move on, considering the sudden change and Lee’s complete reversal on their relationship.At this point, Evangelista asked Cornejo to say what she wanted, and to let the people who were watching the show know what really went on between the two.Instead, the model-stylist went on another on-camera tirade that sounded all too familiar:“Kuya Cedric, ngayon panalo ka. Pasensya, simple lang ako, hindi ako makapangyarihan. Ngayon panalo ka, pero matakot ka sa ikalawang buhay. Ako, handa akong ibuwis ang buhay ko na nagsasabi ako ng katotohanan. Hindi ako natatakot. Hindi po ako natatakot. Mas ikakatakot ko ang ikalawang buhay sa impiyerno,” Deniece said while looking at the camera, again with her characteristic hand gestures.Before the interview ended, Evangelista asked, “O totoo na ba ‘to?”, to which Cornejo replied, “Opo, yan po ang totoo, ate”.Cornejo was in tears during her moment on camera, but was back to normal and smiling after just a few seconds.Cedric Lee could not be reached for comment as of this writing.",

Apparently, this is his response to President Rodrigo Duterte’s threat to him last Friday, November 24. This is after the president issued Proclamation 360, terminating the peace negotiations.“If Joma Sison comes here, I will arrest him or if I were him, ‘wag na siyang bumalik dito. Better still, I will not allow him to enter his native land and that is a very painful experience, especially if you’re dying and you think na you should be buried in your own cemetery, in your own town,” President Duterte said during the alumni homecoming in San Beda College of Law.Sison, 78, has been in self-exile in the Netherlands since 1987, after the collapse of the peace negotiations during the presidency of Corazon “Cory” Aquino. He is also the chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), which represents rebels in talks concerning the CCP’s armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA).Last Wednesday, President Duterte said he would order the arrest, not only of armed communist rebels, but also of all the members of “legal fronts” that are helping the Left. He also declared them as “terrorists.” As his response on Thursday, ponse, Joma Sison called Duterte the “No. 1 terrorist in the Philippines.” This Friday, he released another statement.“He violated the mutual agreement that talks would be discreet until there was good news to announce at the end of the fifth or sixth round of formal talks. In the course of his rants, Duterte unwittingly exposed his scarce, shallow and defective knowledge of the peace process,” Sison said of Duterte, and accused him of sabotaging the peace talks.About his impending arrest once he gets back to the country, Sison said he that he is not afraid. “I will return to my beloved Philippines any time I want to. I’m already old and nothing can scare me anymore, not even death. If I will be arrested, I will not resist. If I will be killed at the airport, so be it. I’ll be a hero anyway, just like my friend Ninoy (Aquino).” He said.Contributed by Renato Pasayao",

    "body": "The office of Senator Risa Hontiveros is in complete mess after four of her nine senior staff, including an executive assistant, resigned between November 25 and November 9, a source who has firsthand knowledge on the issue said.The reason of mass resignation was not clear, but the source said it started when one of her senior staff, Atty. Larry Balbacal, Head, Constituency Services/Legal, and the Senator were engaged in a heated argument on November 21.Since Hontiveros took office last June 2016, the source said no one in her staff lasted more than three months. This is the first time that all nine people lasted for more than five months, the source said.See Also: Hontiveros Challenges Duterte: Ipakulong Mo Na Kami Lahat, Kung Kaya Mo!Babacal filed his resignation on Monday, and on Tuesday, another employee, Finance and HR Head Joanne Calingasan, followed suit.Loading…The biggest blow according to the source is on Wednesday when Executive Assistant Atty. Grace Lozada filed her resignation for “deep personal reasons”.The last person to call it quits was Arielle Lastimosa, Head of the Communications.“Losing almost half of experienced people paralyzes the operation of the Office of the Senator, especially Atty. Lozada, who was responsible in handling Hontiveros’ schedule and served as her personal secretary”, the source said.When asked why the mainstream media was not informed about the mass resignation last week, the source said the Senator tried to fill the vacant positions from lower ranks, but her effort was not enough. She could not find people to fill the vacant positions inside her circle.“Right now, there is no one who will advise her what to explain to the media people after losing those important personalities”, the source said.“Every one of them have their own reasons and it is always boils down to the Senator’s attitude, I guess”, the source said. /Lenny Carpio/",

She answered, “Iniisip ko lang ang personal experiences ko, like my mom being a deaf mute and me growing up without my dad. I’m now our family’s breadwinner, sending my two siblings to school.”Julia became the family’s breadwinner at a very young age. She started her career in show business at a young age of six and one of her goals was to buy a house. In 2012, Julia was finally able to buy one—a 200-square meter property with a mini Japanese garden inside. She also opened a salon and claimed that the business was her way of repaying her grandmother for her unending support.Take a look at the house.In 2015, Julia bought another house, inclusive of three bedrooms, gym and walk-in closet. According to rumors, Coco Martin, Julia’s rumored lover, was the one who bought the house for her as a gift and it is located near his residence. Julia didn’t confirm it though.However, given the new home, Julia said she didn’t want to sell the previous house she bought in 2012.“Gusto kong ipa-rent, ayaw kong ibenta kasi first investment ko,” Julia said.What can you say about her two houses?

    "body": "Few votes at the UN General Assembly in recent years have been held in such an atmosphere of drama and tension as today’s vote on the Trump administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel.The U.S., bracing for what is likely to be a near-unanimous rejection of its policy, took the highly undiplomatic step of warning other countries not to vote against it.“As you consider your vote, I want you to know that the president and U.S. take this vote personally,” U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in a letter delivered to dozens of UN delegations, including Canada’s. “The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us. We will take note of each and every vote on this issue.”U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on the threat at a cabinet meeting Wednesday. “They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” he said. “Well, we’re watching those votes. Let ’em vote against us, we’ll save a lot. We don’t care.”‘That’s generally the kind of provocation that gets people to tell you to go to hell.’ – Paul Heinbecker, former Canadian ambassador to the UNCanada’s former ambassador to the UN told CBC News the U.S. is likely to be opposed by a “very, very significant majority.”“I don’t know what the numbers will be, and the United States will be putting a great deal of pressure on its allies but … I think it’s going to succeed only in isolating itself,” said Paul Heinbecker, who served as ambassador under Jean Chrétien and also as chief foreign policy adviser to Brian Mulroney.Heinbecker said the Haley letter won’t help: “That’s generally the kind of provocation that gets people to tell you to go to hell. And I suspect it will be in this case — especially since the person who’s taking names is a president whose reputation internationally puts the United States’ standing at the lowest ebb it’s ever been.”It was Prime Minister Stephen Harper who changed the way Canada votes at the United Nations. His government’s position was that there was too much focus at the UN on Israel’s sins, driven by a large voting bloc of Arab and Muslim countries with an axe to grind against the Jewish state. In response, Canada would oppose all motions that “singled out” Israel for criticism.Although it hasn’t trumpeted its support for Israel as much as Harper did, the Trudeau government has followed the Harper line. It has frequently voted with the U.S., Israel and a small coterie of Pacific island nations, the largest of which, the Federated States of Micronesia, has a population smaller than Peterborough, Ont.Last December, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, China and 162 other nations all supported a UN resolution reaffirming Geneva Convention protections to Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories. The Trudeau government joined forces with the U.S., Israel, Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands to oppose it.It also voted against motions calling on Israel to respect the “special international regime” status that Jerusalem has officially enjoyed since 1947, even though Canada voted to create that status and it remains part of Canada’s official policy.Canada under pressureTwo weeks ago, Canada voted against a UN resolution calling for a halt to the building of Israeli settlements in occupied East Jerusalem. The resolution passed 155-7. (Nauru, population 11,357, added its voice to the U.S. and Canada’s on that vote.)Canada’s votes on Israel have drawn little public attention, and don’t appear to have cost the Trudeau government support among Arab and Muslim voters, who may be more aware of Trudeau’s support for Syrian refugees.Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada has continued the Harper government’s practice of voting with the U.S. in opposing UN resolutions against Israel. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)But Heinbecker said it will be difficult this time for Canada to continue to vote under the radar against positions it officially espouses.“The Canadian government will come under a lot of pressure and expectation to support the resolution along with its allies,” he said.“Nobody agrees with the Americans on this point.”He said U.S. allies would much prefer to be working together with the United States, not at cross purposes, “but this is an important point of principle.”Security Council seat could be at stakeComplicating matters further is Trudeau’s desire to win a UN Security Council seat. The Harper government was widely believed to have blown its shot at a seat over its support for Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu. It could be embarrassing for Trudeau, who once excoriated Harper for that loss, to suffer the same rejection for the same reasons.Heinbecker said any country that alienates a bloc of approximately 50 Muslim-majority nations is unlikely to gain the 129 votes generally needed to win a seat on the Security Council.“You don’t sacrifice a principle in order to get a Security Council seat,” said the former diplomat. “But in this case, the principle is in the other direction. All the way back to the establishment of Israel, Canada has supported the idea of a two-state solution.”Trudeau is expected to come under pressure to step away from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and vote against the Trump administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel. (Reuters)The Trudeau government has also been careful not to alienate the Trump administration while NAFTA talks are under way. Nor would the Liberals want to lose support they have gained in the pro-Israel community.A vote to support the Trump administration, on the other hand, would not only force Canada to again contradict its own longstanding positions, but would also risk alienating the party’s pro-Palestinian supporters. And now, thanks to the Haley letter and Trump’s comments yesterday, it would open the government to accusations that it caved to crude threats from Washington.If Canada chooses the third option — abstention — the unintended consequence of Trump’s Jerusalem move may be to cost the U.S.-Israel alliance its only voting ally with a population larger than the city of Peterborough.",

Antonio Trillanes IV for undertaking “back-channel talks” with China that “only advanced [the] interest of our Asian neighbor.”Martin Diño, Duterte’s national campaign manager, announced Friday’s filing of the treason and espionage charges by supporters of the Davao mayor in the Office of the Ombudsman, at a press conference at Club Filipino in San Juan City.The filing came as Trillanes publicly accused Duterte, the front-runner in the presidential race, of having millions of pesos in undeclared bank accounts.The complaint said “Senator Trillanes met with the Chinese 16 times, and he requested that the meeting [be] secret. In those meetings, Trillanes made mention that the Philippines cannot enforce coastal protection. And that made the Chinese take an aggressive [stance] and take over our areas like Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands. That alone constitutes treason,” former Rep. Ronald Adamat, one of the complainants, said, quoting from supposed notes made by former Philippine Ambassador to China Sonia Brady.Although the complaint recognized that under the law, treason requires that the Philippines be involved in a war, it said “external aggression” was committed by China when it “immediately occupied the subject areas.”As for the charge of espionage, the complaint said China had been “emboldened” by the information “gathered from” Trillanes.We include the President because Trillanes could not have done this without the order of the President. They breached international policy. They did it without coursing their efforts through the foreign affairs department,” Adamat said.Source: Asian Press / PDI – May 08, 2016Commentscomments",

    "body": "Wait lang, let's recapPH-US Mutual Defense TreatyQ1 2012: Tensions escalate to alarming levelsDouglas Paal of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace writes, “If you were viewing all this activity purely through the filter of the media, however, you might also conclude that Obama had successfully tightened the noose of containment around China [Carnegie].”Q2 2012: The Scarborough StandoffThe US requested the same thing from the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s.The US and USSR agreed that the Soviets will immediately pull out their missiles and warships near the Cuban coast. Meanwhile, the US agreed to dismantle her Jupiter missiles in Turkey, but only after several months. US requested this because she doesn’t want to appear weak in the eyes of the public [Bernstein 1980].Manny V PangilinanThe MVP-DelRosario-Carpio-Roxas ConnectionDFA Sec. del Rosario consistently took a hardline stance. MVP and Del Rosario have a very close relationship.Basically, Del Rosario and Manny Pangilinan are business partners.Liliit ang hatian, eh.Additionally, DOLE Secretary Silvestre Bello III noted that the senior magistrate shared an “umbilical cord” with Avelino Cruz Jr., a legal counsel of Roxas, at the Firm [ Inq ]. Yes, even Roxas and Carpio share a strong connection.Manny Pangilinan, Albert del Rosario, Mar Roxas, and Antonio Carpio share one common interest: PHILEX.3Q 2012: Trillanes “volunteers”Trillanes met with a senior Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs official the night before [his meeting with Brady] Trillanes called Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario a traitor and said he committed treason Trillanes secretly met with Chinese officials about Scarborough Shoal and the West Philippine Sea. Trillanes said in the Philippines, \"No one cares about Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal\" Trillanes said China never intended to put up a station in the Scarborough Shoal. Trillanes told Chinese officials the Philippines cannot enforce its coastal protection Trillanes said the Philippines should have lobbied with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as China did Trillanes insisted on bilateral talks with China when the Cabinet wanted a multilateral approach.Ang gulo naman! (This is confusing!)PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO SHARE! THANKS!In ’s “ PH-China on West Philippine Sea: The issue of trust, or the lack of it ”, I explained how the Philippines flip-flopped on its stance towards the South China dispute. One day we tell China we wanna talk, then we piss them off a day later. This happened on at least four different occasions through the second and third quarters of 2011.Common sense dictates that the Philippines may not be as truthful as we would have hoped. Kapag nakaharap kasi tayo sa China, gusto nating makipagbati. Pero oras na pagtalikod natin, kabaligtaran ang ating ginagawa. Ang gulo-gulo talaga natin noong 2011, ang hirap ispelingin. In diplomatic terms, it appears na kinakabog natin ang North Korea sa level ng unpredictability.Engaging in talks means openness to compromise. If we had zero intentions to compromise, why did we even bother to talk with China to begin with? We should have already gone to war and have the matter settled already. But we didn’t.And, despite the failed talks with China, the Aquino administration even had the balls to provoke the Chinese in July 2011 when various Philippine government agencies started addressing the area as the “West Philippine Sea.” [ AsiaOne Pasimplehin ko lang saglit ha…As a sovereign entity, the Philippines has the freedom to choose between a military and a diplomatic solution to address the South China Sea dispute. Now, a diplomatic solution requires the willingness of both parties to compromise, something that’s hard to detect on the Philippines' part given our actions throughout 2011 [ TP: Trust ].Our uncompromising stance made diplomacy ineffective, so why didn’t we declare war against China right away? We still want the South China Sea dispute resolved, after all. So why don't we just resolve the issue through \"Trial by Combat\"?Because everyone knows we will lose, as was already explained before [ TP: Yasay's Face And in the middle of it all, we decided to unnecessarily provoke China even further when we unilaterally renamed the South China Sea into West Philippine Sea [ Inq ]!\"South China\" to \"West Philippine\"?So parang gusto nating makipag-diplomasya, pero tuwing babanggitin natin ang dagat, sinasampal natin sa kanila na “West Philippine” ito at hindi “South China”. Wala naman akong paki, kaya lang, pano magbubunga ang usapan kung harapan mong binabastos ang kausap mo?Labo, ateh. Labo.We won’t lose because the US will help us via mutual defense, right?Well, if the United States was really serious about helping us in a prospective war, it would have already issued stronger statements in as early as March 2011, but it did not. As a matter of fact, when the UNCLOS decision came out last week, the US used “quiet diplomacy” to persuade us to calm down [ Reuters ].Pasimplehin ko lang ulit saglit ha:Kunwari, jowa mo si Amerika. Kaibigan ni jowa si China.Isang araw, napansin mong sinisiraan ka ni China. Sa sarili mo lang, gusto mo na talaga siyang umbagin, pero 5’1” ka lang at 6’10” si China. Wala ka talagang laban e. Nagsumbong ka kay jowa tapos sabi ni jowa, tutulungan ka, pero hindi niya sinabi kung paano.Ikaw naman si tanga, asa kang tutulungan ka, kaya tinext mo si China, “Hoy China letse ka tatadyakan kita!” Tapos biglang litaw si China sa kalsada sa harap ng bahay mo, may hawak daw na kutsilyo.Nabalitaan ito ni jowa, tapos ang sabi sa yo ni Amerika, “Huwag ka na lang lumabas ng bahay. Intindihin mo na lang si China.”Tanginang ‘yan, #Paasa. Niloloko na tayo ng harapan ng Amerika, para parin tayong tangang umaasa. Pero sige, dahil umaasa pa rin tayo na baka sakaling tulungan tayo ng Amerika, tuloy pa rin tayo sa pagputak.Hay, hindi na natuto. Talagang tayong lahat ay baliw sa pag-ibig, no?The Department of Foreign Affairs, headed by Sec. del Rosario, clearly had – and still has – an uncompromising stance. To make matters worse, subsequent events show that prodding from the United States only served to embolden the Aquino administration.In November 2011, US President Barack Obama told Asia that US was 'here to stay' as a Pacific power [ Guardian ]. Shortly thereafter, China warned \"external forces\" not to get involved in its maritime disputes with neighboring countries over the South China Sea [ BBC ].Obama ignored China’s warning.A month later, through his ten-day Asian tour, Obama reportedly managed to convey successfully his administration’s determination to “rebalance” American attention, influence, and investment toward Asia, and away from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Itong si Obama, di naman tutulong sa laban, nanggagatong pa. SARAP KUTUSAN.A few days after Obama’s Asian tour, Chinese President Hu Jintao told Chinese military personnel they should \"make extended preparations for warfare\" [ BBC ].Days later, a Chinese naval vessel was seen near the Sabina shoal on 11 and 12 December, according to del Rosario. The vessel, however, \"did not drop anchor or unload construction materials and appeared to be just passing through [ BBC ].\"Just when we thought del Rosario can’t get any more hardline, he announced in January 2012 that the Philippines is prepared to validate its claim under the UNCLOS. He even taunted China by inviting it to do the same with its own claims [ Inq ].Yes, things are escalating very, very quickly, and it reached almost reached breaking point in April 2012.In April 2012, a Philippine naval ship, two Chinese vessels and at least eight fishing boats got into a standoff in Scarborough Shoal [ VoA ].In response, China gradually increased its naval presence in the area. By late May 2012, ninety-two (92) Chinese ships have already occupied Panatag Shoal [ Inq ].Yes, NINETY TWO SHIPS. CHINESE SHIPS.In short, both Chinese and Philippine Navies were continuously occupying the area and were within shooting distance of each other.If one side shoots the other – even accidentally – it will mean war.We had to de-escalate as soon as possible, and de-escalation is what the Aquino administration tried to do. Note, however, that the operative word here is “tried”, because “try” and “accomplish” are two very different words.Both navies agreed on a troop pullout at around 15 June 2012. The problem, however, is that China didn’t pull out its vessels at the same time the Philippines did [ Inq ].That is, the Chinese navy appeared to have stayed in the area even after Philippine troops have gone home. Because of this, the Philippines considered sending troops back [ Inq ].In an official statement, the DFA accused China of duplicity and intimidation [ GMA ].“It appears that there is an element that is lacking in our negotiations. I seek a deeper element of trust from our Chinese friends,” Del Rosario said [ Inq ].China claimed miscommunication. The Philippines understood the agreement as a simultaneous pullout but China said it thought she made it clear that while the Philippines will immediately pull out, the Chinese navy will “pull out gradually” to avoid public anger and disappointment in the Chinese Mainland [ Rap ].This kind of compromise is not new.The problem however, is that the DFA issued press releases even before it asked China why. In short, DFA and del Rosario failed.Wala tayong binatbat kung gyera pag-uusapan, pero bakit mas matapang pa tayo sa China? Tanginathis.The Aquino administration said it wants to try to engage in peaceful and fruitful negotiations with China, but it continues to provoke the Chinese government by sending conflicting messages.The failure of PH-China diplomacy in mid-2012 can be attributed to Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario’s preference for an uncompromising stance over the issue, along with the fact that he talks too much. Del Rosario loved issuing press releases about everything that happens in the South China Sea, further antagonizing the Chinese. According to former Ambassador Sonia Brady’s notes as relayed by Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile “US has already let (del Rosario) go, binitawan na siya.” [ ABS But can things get shittier than this?Del Rosario’s formal diplomatic channel (front door) failed, so the Aquino administration had to rely on informal (backdoor) channels.And that's where it got messier.While PNoy, DFA, and del Rosario were bickering with China over the Scarborough Shoal issue, MVP was actually in China, trying to strike a business deal with the Chinese.Remember that this mess started with MVP’s Forum Energy – Philex joint venture, when its ship sailed to Reed (Recto) Bank, trying to to look for hydrocarbons. MVP seems to have changed his mind: he now wanted Chinese participation, something that Filipino major shareholders were not very happy about [ Inq ].On 24 June 2012, MVP announced he plans to “internationalize” and “depoliticize” Reed Bank by including China into the venture, through state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) [ Inq ].Later on, it was discovered that MVP was del Rosario’s own backdoor negotiator. PNoy even asked del Rosario who authorized MVP to strike a deal with CNOOC [ GMA ].It’s messy. It’s really, really, really messy. And just like a broken record, I will again say, ”It still gets worse.”Let’s pause for a moment because something’s fishy.At this point, two things are clear:According to del Rosario’s profile on the DFA website [ DFA ], “The Secretary’s experience in the private sector included positions as …director of…Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC), Philex Mining Corporation, Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation (MPTC), Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corporation (MPTDC), Manila North Tollways Corporation (MNTC), ABC Development Corporation (ABC 5)”The 2011 Reed Bank Incident, which started this whole brouhaha, involved a Philex venture. Philex, MPIC, MPTC, MPTDC, MNTC, and ABC5, where del Rosario used to work, are all currently controlled by Manny Pangilinan.It’s also interesting to note that Mar Roxas also owns Philex shares [ GMA ], so the three of them have a strong, common, business interest. No wonder why they didn’t wanna share Reed Bank in 2011, as that would mean profit sharing.And since we’re already here, let’s also mention Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, one of the most vocal personalities in the UNCLOS case.Carpio is affiliated with the Villaraza and Angangco law firm [ TV5 ], more common known as “The Firm”. “The Firm” is heavily identified with the mining sector [ TheFirm ], with some of its members giving lectures sponsored by the Chamber of Mines [ CoM ]. More specifically, one of “The Firm’s” biggest clients is Philex Mining [ Inq ].Yes, Philex.Now, recall that MVP started negotiating with China in early 2012, that is, Philex is now willing to share profits with China, a 180-degree turn from the company’s original stance. Maybe they’ve realized that China is too much to handle.It’s also worthy to note that with Philex’ 180-degree turn came another interesting personality: Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, who went on a whirlwind tour of Southeast Asia In July 2012 to help de-escalate tensions [ JakartaPost ]. At first glance, this appears to be a welcome development, especially since PNoy, del Rosario, and MVP are doing a terrible job at it.However, of all the 11 ASEAN foreign ministers, why Indonesia’s?You see, the MVP group of companies is, in reality, owned by the rich and powerful Salim Group [ MT ], Indonesia’s version of our own San Miguel Corporation.Convenient, isn’t it? Kuncha-kunchabahan na lang.Tanginathis.But we still have one last thing to talk about: the disgraced Senator Antonio Trillanes.Sen. Antonio Trillanes, PNoy’s ally and friend, volunteered to be a backdoor negotiator. Aquino accepted the offer, despite Trillanes’ lack of a background on foreign affairs and diplomacy [ Rap ]. According to Trillanes, however, Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa asked him whether he “would like to help” as tensions between Manila and Beijing worsened in May 2012 [ GMA ].Whatever the case, one things is clear: PNoy authorized Trillanes to engage in backdoor diplomacy, despite Trillanes having no foreign relations experience.And just like any James Bond wannabe, Trillanes went to China six times with “no paper trail, no immigration stamps” to meet with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CN MFA). Even the Senate has no record that Trillanes sought permission for any of his trips. Every senator leaving the country, whether government-funded or privately-funded, should have the permission of the Senate President [ TV5 ].One of the clandestine meetings, held 17 August 2012, was recorded by Philippine Ambassador to China Sonia Brady. According to Brady’s noted as leaked by Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile during a September Senate Session [ Rap ]:To cut the long story short, Trillanes wanted bilateral talks, which goes totally contrary to what PNoy’s cabinet wanted. PNoy did not even know the specific arrangements Trillanes made with the Chinese!Trillanes slandered del Rosario, MVP, and the Philippine Armed Forces, when he told the Chinese, straight to their Chinese faces, that del Rosario and MVP wanted a “war scenario” [ ABS ] so Philex can access Reed Bank.The meeting with Ambassador Brady was on 17 August 2012, remember?On 20 July 2012, Trillanes called del Rosario a \"War Freak\". Trillanes added, “[The] fear that China will build an outpost there in Scarborough was never true all along. It’s better that we just course this through peaceful means”. [Inq] A week later, Brady suffered a debilitating stroke [ TV5 ].Now, remember that these are Brady’s notes as relayed by Enrile, so Enrile may be lying. However, Trillanes’ and del Rosario’s statements only served to confirm Enrile’s claims.After Enriles’ September 2012 expose, del Rosario said PH backdoor channeling efforts are backfiring.Del Rosario added, “I think that while backchanneling has its purpose, in our case it’s doing more harm than good. It is important that we speak with one voice on this matter [ Inq ].”Trillanes fired back, \"If Secretary Del Rosario was only close to being effective as a foreign secretary, then there wouldn’t be any need for a back channel in the first place [ Inq ].”It's also worthy to note that all diplomatic correspondence is coursed through the DFA Secretary, so that the leak to Enrile can only be blamed upon del Rosario.So gumanti rin pala yata si del Rosario kay Trillanes?Yes it is. I was initially confused and you are probably still confused right now.Actually, even China was confused, and that's the last thing we wanted to happen.The del Rosario-MVP camp didn’t want to share the South China Sea, then it tried to share it, but it refused bilateral talks. Meanwhile, PNoy-appointed Trillanes who wanted bilateral talks, but doesn’t wanna share the South China Sea.If I were China, I would say, “Putang ina, ano ba talaga? Ang gugulo niyo ah!”Formal channels have failed, and this time, backdoor channels failed too. Diplomatic channels have been exhausted. The Philippines is now in trouble and it has nowhere else to go.Because the Aquino administration bungled every diplomatic opportunity that came along the way, the Philippines had nothing else to do but to initiate UNCLOS arbitral proceedings on 22 January 2013 [ PCA ].And here we are, in 2016, desperately trying to figure out how to fix the mess that these idiots created. Tapos, ang marami sa inyo, naniniwala na lang nang basta sa basta sa dyaryo, samantalang mga kaalyado ng mga mokong na ito ang may-ari ng mga media outlets na binabasa ninyo.Baka kailangan ko nang magtago pagkatapos nito.Did you like this post?

    "body": "Last week, Kapamilya actress, Erich Gonzales revealed that she had officially broken up with her Brazilian-Japanese boyfriend, Daniel Matsunaga.Erich's admission did not really come as a huge surprise for some fans. A few days before the official announcement, Erich's followers on the popular photo sharing site Instagram noticed that she deleted her photos with Daniel Matsunaga. This started rumors about their breakup.Initially, Erich did not publicly comment on the rumors regarding her relationship with Daniel. Because of the actress' reluctance to talk about the matter, fans were hoping that it was all just a small misunderstanding.Fans got their hopes up that maybe the two could still work it out when Daniel reportedly said that they were \"ok\" in a comment on Instagram a couple of days before the sad truth finally came out.Some popular sources for showbiz news on the internet have speculated that the breakup was caused by a third party, supposedly a girl. However, the third party theory was replaced by a more shocking one shortly after.Now, sources say the real reason behind the breakup was because of a misunderstanding between the two about money. The money rumor instantly went viral, causing a number of people to speculate that Daniel may have been leeching money off of his relatively more successful girlfriend.For a time, Daniel kept quiet about the accusations leveled against him.But according to an article by pep.ph, Daniel has reportedly released a statement regarding the issue.Daniel chose to talk about the accusations on Instagram. The actor/model said the following in a comment:“I have respect for myself and I don’t depend on anybody to earn anything cause everything that I have comes from the Lord.\"\"Do not judge without knowing what happened.\"\"God bless you, guys.”Check out this photo of his comment from Instagram here:He even had the following to say to fans who he claims were easily persuaded by the rumors they see online:",

The act was so convincing that his girlfriend was clearly shocked when she saw her boyfriend was put in handcuffs and dragged in the streets and forced to kneel.The officer handed the 'warrant' to the girlfriend which of course is not a real arrest warrant but a note says \"Will You Marry Me?\".Jasmine Ferreras was confused for a moment trying to make out the words written in the supposed warrant. When she realized that it was a proposal, she was stunned and overwhelmed by a wave of mixed feelings - possibly mostly with relief from the fact that her boyfriend will not be shot because of 'panlalaban'.Anyway, although the conservative would say the act is too soon because of the recent controversy surround the national police due to alleged EJKs they are facing this wedding proposal video is undeniably a creative and timely one.Here's thevideo that is now going viral:",

    "body": "The Andy Bautista Impeachment Case Two impeachment cases have so far been filed against embattled Comelec Chair Andres “Andy” Bautista. The first one, from Atty. Oliver Lozano, will not go far because he’s basically a “serial nuisance filer”, as he has filed (usually frivolous) impeachment cases against every president since the 1990s [The second one filed yesterday by Rep. Jacinto Paras and Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, however, was endorsed by House Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, Kabayan Party-list Rep. Harry Roque, and Rep. Abraham Tolentino of Cavite[Yes, the second one is a go.The second complaint cited five grounds for impeachment [Betrayal of Public Trust for failing to implement the Data Privacy Act of 2012 that led to the Comeleaks incident, the biggest data breach incident in history [NPC], where confidential information about tens of millions of voters were leaked for everyone to see. Betrayal of Public Trust for declining to assume direct control of the task force created after the Comeleaks incident. Betrayal of Public Trust for saying that the “ñ” modification is merely cosmetic in nature, effectively attempting to exonerate those responsible for it. Betrayal of Public Trust for filing incomplete SALNs. Bribery for receiving commissions from the Divina Law office.Evaluating the Grounds The first two grounds have been extensively discussed in a National Privacy Commission press release dated 05 January 2017 [“The willful and intentional disregard of his duties as head of agency, which he should know or ought to know, is tantamount to gross negligence… A head of agency making his acts depend on the recommendations of the Executive Director or the Information Technology Department amplifies the want of even slight care...” The third ground, meanwhile, has been extensively discussed in the 13 May 2016 article “The fourth ground, or betrayal of public trust when Bautista underdeclared his assets, is well-ensconced in the “Corona Doctrine”, as established when former Chief Justice was removed from office for committing pretty much the same offense.The fifth ground – bribery through the receipt of commissions from Divina Law – is a bit shaky. I have to see the actual complaint first to see if it has any chance of succeeding. Two impeachment cases have so far been filed against embattled Comelec Chair Andres “Andy” Bautista. The first one, from Atty. Oliver Lozano, will not go far because he’s basically a “serial nuisance filer”, as he has filed (usually frivolous) impeachment cases against every president since the 1990s [ Star ]. With that said, I doubt that there’d be a congressman willing to endorse it.The second one filed yesterday by Rep. Jacinto Paras and Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, however, was endorsed by House Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, Kabayan Party-list Rep. Harry Roque, and Rep. Abraham Tolentino of Cavite[ CNN ].Yes, the second one is a go.The second complaint cited five grounds for impeachment [ GMA ]:The first two grounds have been extensively discussed in a National Privacy Commission press release dated 05 January 2017 [ NPC ], part of which reads:The third ground, meanwhile, has been extensively discussed in the 13 May 2016 article “ BBM vs Leni: Comelec-Smartmatic gives Sec Abaya a run for his money ”.The fourth ground, or betrayal of public trust when Bautista underdeclared his assets, is well-ensconced in the “Corona Doctrine”, as established when former Chief Justice was removed from office for committing pretty much the same offense.The fifth ground – bribery through the receipt of commissions from Divina Law – is a bit shaky. I have to see the actual complaint first to see if it has any chance of succeeding.Hurdling the Lower House Truth be told, I think that Congress may as well forget about the first, second, third, and fifth ground, as the fourth ground – SALN underdeclaration – is more than enough to convict Bautista. Surely, P 50 million in bank deposits declared in his SALN is way below the P330 million that Bautista’s wife Patricia discovered.And even if Bautista, by some accounting miracle, manages to escape that one, the undeclared real properties are also enough to kick him out.I have good reason to believe that the impeachment complaint will simply breeze through the House of Representatives. While some camps may argue that the supposed “supermajority” is mostly composed of political turncoats, we have to remember that a verified impeachment complaint need only gather the signatures of a third of the Lower House.That is, it’s pretty easy to get 100 signatures from the 290-or-so congressmen, especially since 121 of these congressmen belong to the administration’s PDP-Laban Party. With 100 signatures, an endorsement by the House Justice Committee would be unnecessary, and the articles of impeachment will be automatically transmitted to the Senate for trial.The question, however, is whether Andy will be convicted in a Senate impeachment trial, or not.More on that later.Comelec commissioners react Several hours after the endorsement of the impeachment complaint, the Comelec Commissioners released a resolution requesting Bautista to file a leave or resign [If Bautista files a leave of absence, the remaining commissioners can do whatever they want without Andy’s meddling: they can file a resolution that will finally ban Smartmatic from Philippine soil, or give some attention to Nelly Villafuerte’s 2013 complaint against Leni Robredo, or even conduct an internal investigation on Andy Bautista’s corruption and his alleged connivance with Divina Law.Meanwhile, If Bautista resigns, then he will lose his partial immunity from suit, exposing him to a barrage of graft cases that he will have to battle for the rest of his life.But like what I’ve said in a previous section, the Corona Doctrine virtually ensures impeachment in the Lower House and a conviction in the Senate for Bautista, so it appears that Andy has no way out.Well, not really.A Three-pronged Strategy If I were Andy Bautista, I would use a three-pronged approach as a way out.First, I will cling onto my Comelec post no matter what.I will choose to remain Comelec chief until my term ends in February 2022, regardless of the public humiliation that’ll come with it. That way, I can maintain (1) partial immunity from suit and (2) significant control over the electoral process.This way, I can temporarily ward off lawsuits as I find ways to sabotage the 2019 and 2022 elections, ensuring the victory of “friendly” candidates. Most important among these candidates is the next president, who has the power of executive clemency, a power that Andy will really benefit from.But this won’t matter if I get removed from office so…Second, I will ensure acquittal at the Senate Impeachment Trial.I will probably be impeached in the Lower house, but the Senate impeachment trial is an entirely different ballgame. I can, for example, strike deals with friendly senators in exchange for an acquittal, or I can simply blackmail a few for the same effect.Senators, however, are political animals. Thus, some of them may resist my charm for fear of losing public support, so…Third, I will minimize public backlash by going on a massive PR spree.I will spend like there’s no tomorrow to improve not only my own image, but also the image of the senators who will side with me. This similar to what I have been doing during these past several weeks, where I have appeared on TV shows left and right, in an attempt to deodorize my stinking reputation. Yes, the last PR spree was a failure because my brother Martin is so stupid [I can also tap on my allies to aid in this effort. Take for example, family friend and former DOTC Usec. Rene “Timmy” Limcaoco, whose family owns and controls Luzon Development Bank, or the bank where I deposited my presumably ill-gotten wealth. Limcaoco’s wife Melissa is a co-founder of Hatchd Inc. [ Several hours after the endorsement of the impeachment complaint, the Comelec Commissioners released a resolution requesting Bautista to file a leave or resign [ CNN ]. The problem, however, is that Bautista cannot possibly do either.If Bautista files a leave of absence, the remaining commissioners can do whatever they want without Andy’s meddling: they can file a resolution that will finally ban Smartmatic from Philippine soil, or give some attention to Nelly Villafuerte’s 2013 complaint against Leni Robredo, or even conduct an internal investigation on Andy Bautista’s corruption and his alleged connivance with Divina Law.Meanwhile, If Bautista resigns, then he will lose his partial immunity from suit, exposing him to a barrage of graft cases that he will have to battle for the rest of his life.But like what I’ve said in a previous section, the Corona Doctrine virtually ensures impeachment in the Lower House and a conviction in the Senate for Bautista, so it appears that Andy has no way out.Well, not really.If I were Andy Bautista, I would use a three-pronged approach as a way out.I will choose to remain Comelec chief until my term ends in February 2022, regardless of the public humiliation that’ll come with it. That way, I can maintain (1) partial immunity from suit and (2) significant control over the electoral process.This way, I can temporarily ward off lawsuits as I find ways to sabotage the 2019 and 2022 elections, ensuring the victory of “friendly” candidates. Most important among these candidates is the next president, who has the power of executive clemency, a power that Andy will really benefit from.But this won’t matter if I get removed from office so…I will probably be impeached in the Lower house, but the Senate impeachment trial is an entirely different ballgame. I can, for example, strike deals with friendly senators in exchange for an acquittal, or I can simply blackmail a few for the same effect.Senators, however, are political animals. Thus, some of them may resist my charm for fear of losing public support, so…I will spend like there’s no tomorrow to improve not only my own image, but also the image of the senators who will side with me. This similar to what I have been doing during these past several weeks, where I have appeared on TV shows left and right, in an attempt to deodorize my stinking reputation. Yes, the last PR spree was a failure because my brother Martin is so stupid [ Transcript ], but I’ll charge that to experience moving forward.I can also tap on my allies to aid in this effort. Take for example, family friend and former DOTC Usec. Rene “Timmy” Limcaoco, whose family owns and controls Luzon Development Bank, or the bank where I deposited my presumably ill-gotten wealth. Limcaoco’s wife Melissa is a co-founder of Hatchd Inc. [ CV ], one of Rappler’s major investors. Thus, I can ask the Limcaocos to force the financially ailing media company to write puff pieces about me or my would-be senator allies. All three prongs should work for the strategy to succeed, and I honestly think that Andy has the IQ and the US$ to make this work. Now, let’s see how the second prong can be implement in the Senate impeachment trial.Voting at Impeachment TrialThe voting patterns will most likely be along party lines, similar to the pattern described in my 18 May 2016 article “Fourteen senators will almost certainly convict Bautista, and they are:The PDP-Laban Bloc (Ejercito, Pimentel, Zubiri, Pacquiao), or the ruling party.The Macho Bloc (Sotto, Lacson, Honasan), that owe Bautista nothing and who usually call a spade a spade.The NPC Bloc (Poe, Legarda, Gatchalian, Gordon, Sotto), that has a standing coalition with PDP-Laban.Nancy Binay, who hates LP’s guts after what LP did to her father Jojo.Nacionalista’s Cynthia Villar’s son Mark is a Duterte cabinet member, so she probably vote to convict.Angara is an independent administration ally [GMA]. Hence, I can see only 8 potential senators who can acquit Bautista, and they are:Sonny Trillanes (Ind) Franklin Drilon (LP) Bam Aquino (LP) Joel Villanueva (CIBAC-LP) Kiko Pangilinan (LP) Ralph Recto (LP) Chiz Escudero (Ind) [FB] Risa Hontiveros (Akbayan-LP) Escudero, Villanueva, and Recto may need sweeteners, but I believe that they can be convinced to acquit Bautista.With 22 senator judges, 14 “convict” votes and 8 “acquit” votes, Bautista will remain in the Comelec.Risa foils Andy’s Strategy Senator Leila de Lima is detained for drug-related charges and Senator Cayetano has resigned to head the Department of Foreign Affairs, reducing the roster of senators from 24 to 22. Now, a two-thirds majority vote is required for a conviction, so that having 22 senator-judges means 15 convict votes are required, i.e. 8 acquit votes is enough for Andy to avoid impeachment.The voting patterns will most likely be along party lines, similar to the pattern described in my 18 May 2016 article “ Mark Villar thwarts LP’s Plan B ”.Fourteen senators will almost certainly convict Bautista, and they are:Hence, I can see only 8 potential senators who can acquit Bautista, and they are:Escudero, Villanueva, and Recto may need sweeteners, but I believe that they can be convinced to acquit Bautista.With 22 senator judges, 14 “convict” votes and 8 “acquit” votes, Bautista will remain in the Comelec.My lawyer-friends and I are confident that prosecutors can easily find probable cause for charges of kidnapping with serious illegal detention against Hontiveros, especially since the parents of not one but BOTH of the underage witnesses are demanding custody of their children.And what comes after probable cause? A warrant of arrest and unfortunately for Hontiveros, kidnapping with serious illegal detention is a non-bailable offense [A conviction is not even necessary at this point: all that's needed is detention without bail.Thus, a kidnapping with serious illegal detention case, if filed against Hontiveros, will land her a spot in the PNP custodial center, beside incarcerated Senators Estrada, Revilla, and de Lima. And just like de Lima, detention will prevent her from participating in Bautista’s impeachment trial.With Hontiveros down, the total number of senator judges will be reduced from 22 to 21, so that a two-thirds majority will be reduced from 15 to just 14.But recalling the previous section, we already have 14 senators who will almost certainly vote to convict, right? Yes, Andy may still have seven allies, but with only 21 senator-judges, seven acquit votes are not enough: Andy will still get removed from office.Senator Risa Hontiveros, thank you for your stupidity.

    "body": "The Philippines is sitting on a gold mine – literally. The country’s gold reserves – the ones still in the earth – are the second biggest in the world. They alone, if they were extracted, could do for the Philippine economy what oil did for Saudi Arabia following the discovery of ‘black gold’ in 1938 near a village called Dammam. They could wipe out poverty and create a boom bigger than Japan’s ‘economic miracle’ – the post-war phenomenon that took that country from destitution to become the world’s second-largest economy.Back in 2011, then secretary-general of the Philippines National Statistical Coordination Board, Romulo A. Virola, claimed that the country’s gold reserves were equal to 65.1 times the income gap – the amount needed to eradicate poverty. That’s a stunning statistic. But, of course, it fell on deaf ears.The Philippine’s love-hate – and latterly mostly hate – relationship with this most precious metal is likely to ensure that it will never be used for that. Its gold is likely to remain in the ground; its wealth and what it could do for the country and its people never to be realised. Today, instead of being Asia’s top gold producer, the Philippines is the fifth after China, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. And it’s likely to sink further.Rich gold deposits lie right across the archipelago from the island regions of Luzon to Minadao. They occur in 73 of the country’s 81 provinces. The estimated worth of these reserves have been placed at US$1.4 trillion – at today’s exchange rate that’s PHP70.2 trillion.And yet governments have repeatedly failed to utilise this resource – seemingly, environment-management and land-rights issues are beyond their capability of addressing, leading them to suppress the industry rather than celebrate it.The Volatilian™ believes this is one of he worst pieces of economic judgement the Philippines has ever made. We can’t think of a single country that would reject a gift like the gift of gold that the Philippines has been given – particularly a country that has so much need of it. This government and previous ones know the numbers; they know the economic might that the country’s gold resources can deliver. But politics-as-usual has ensured that maintaining poverty levels is preferable to getting this stuff out of the soil.There are 26 million poor people in the Philippines; more than 12 million living in extreme poverty. They might not find a meal today. Meanwhile, Environment and Natural Resources Secretary, Gina Lopez, continues to make the case that closing down the country’s mines – and gold producers are on that list – is going to benefit these people more. They may not have food, they may not have jobs but they will – according to her – have a pristine environment for their children and their children’s children.And we’ll believe that when we see it. We’ve seen, for example, the state of the country’s rivers and waterways; they’re a disgrace and they also fall under her purview. These dead bodies of stagnant polluted water are everywhere, not just around mining sites. But Lopez doesn’t take those on with much passion. If they were owned by big companies she might; but they’re not – filled with discarded refuse and human waste, they’re government waterways. There’s no glory in it for her.Back to mining, Lopez has done little if anything to deal with illegal miners who have never given a tinker’s cuss for environmental standards any more than the care for the safety of their workers. But of course, again these aren’t large corporations that could – if she did her job properly – be fully regulated and kick in billions to the economy; far more than they do right now. These are local prospectors and often operating in indigenous areas. She can’t go after them, she might be charged with destroying their livelihood. So they get a free pass – environmentally destructive and unsafe though many of them are.The real problem is this. The Philippine Government seems incapable of managing its mining industry. It’s not a new problem; it’s always been like that. And Lopez, from what we’ve seen, is the last person to handle this problem. It needs someone who’s environmentally aware, of course; but it certainly doesn’t need an eco-warrior in charge pursuing a personal vendetta against the mining companies.It also needs someone who can work with the industry and not against it; someone who comprehensively understands mining.Let’s take a look at just one company operating in the Philippine gold fields – OceanaGold Corporation, an Australian-Canadian transnational that has gold-mining interests in El Salvador, New Zealand and the United States.This company is presently the subject of a Lopez suspension order which plunged the company’s shares by 8% and wiped US$200 million of its market cap within minutes of her announcement of the ban at a loose press conference she’d called even before notifying the company. That will do as a passing example of how irresponsible she’s been on this issue.But if OceanaGold is truly an environmental danger, how come it operates and with the government’s blessing in New Zealand, a country where environmentalism is nothing short of being a religion? How come, too, it has approval to mine in South Carolina in the US to where it will likely now switch most of its Philippine resources? These countries have far more stringent environmentalist policies that the Philippines has ever had. The US practically invented them. Furthermore these countries rigidly enforce them.OceanaGold – Australia’s fourth largest gold producer by market value – is now set to expand its South Carolina operation. As its chief executive, Mick Wilkes, explained: “My investors would now prefer that they had less exposure to the Philippines than more exposure”. Not surprising.And so while mine workers at OceanaGold’s Didipio mine in Nueva Vizcaya province in the Cagayan Valley region of Luzon prepare to lose their jobs, there’s new job prospects for South Carolinians. Some 84% of employees come from the local community. Part of the company’s policy wherever it operates is to hire locally and use local businesses.The company expects to output between 150,000 and 170,000 ounces of gold from its Haile, South Carolina mine this year. Once the mine extension workings have been finalised, it forecasts that by 2020 its annual output from Haile will have reached 250,000 ounces. Last year, the Didipio mine produced around 140,000 ounces.It’s an odd juxtaposition, but while Lopez suspends OceanaGold’s Philippine gold mine, South Carolina’s former governor, Nikki Haley, now the US Ambassador to the United Nations, has supported its expanded gold workings at its mine in her state. Does anyone really believe that Hailey is any less environmentally responsible that Lopez? She’s certainly more economically responsible.Lopez’s macho warrior image might appeal to some sectors of society in the Philippines, but we’re pretty sure they aren’t the ones that go hungry and whose kids go without basic necessities. They won’t live in shacks; they’ll have access to clean water too and they won’t have to defecate in a plastic bag because they have no lavatory. They can happily live without gold – though we’re prepared to bet many of them will have plenty of gold jewelry and trinkets lying around.In New Zealand – one of Mother Earth’s fiercest protectors – OceanaGold has been working with the local government and local communities around Waihi in the North Island, a gold town that can trace its golden roots back to 1879. There, OceanaGold owns and operates the Martha Mine which produces around 100,000 ounces a year. It’s the community’s biggest employer. From the two NZ mines, the company harvests between 500,000 and 600,000 ounces annually and will do so through to 2030. Together these working account for 51% of OceanaGold’s production – against Haile, 28% (at present); Didipio, 21%.Over the past two years, the company has spent US$570 million in acquiring new workings and is now on the look out for more. But not in the Philippines, most likely in Australasia or North America.The rarely mentioned fact is the Philippines’ God-given gold bounty doesn’t belong to the government – it’s their job to manage it – it belongs to the Filipino people; all of them. And so if the Didipio mine is closed down – or any other legal gold mine for that matter, what’s actually happening is that this people’s resource is being squandered for little more than political grandstanding.Lopez’s job if she did but know it is to protect the environment AND manage the country’s resources – it’s all in the job description; Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources. The two are not mutually exclusive. These two facets have to be coordinated; neither one should be upheld to the detriment of the other which is what’s happened under her watch. And with a vengeance.The only people who are applauding her hippy-style of management are the Green elite who have no need for a gold industry. Indeed, many will be offended by the notion of mining gold in areas that Lopez wishes to designate as ecology zones comprising “blue lagoons and enchanted rivers” – another pipe dream that’s never going to be realised. But in the good old Philippine tradition, keep the people living in hope.",

    "body": "Three days before the Barangay Elections, the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition (TDC) made a final appeal to the Comelec for their demands that include higher compensation package, assurance of security and legal protection for the teachers who will sit as Board of Election Tellers (BET) on Monday’s village election. The group expressed dismay because according to them, the Comelec seems to ignore their request for a meeting they have submitted as early as mid-August.“Teachers will work for almost 24 hours or even more, from the time of distribution of election materials in the respective Comelec centers at early dawn of Monday up to the completion of all the tasks that usually up until the morning of the next day.” Benjo Basas, the group’s national chairperson said. “Yet teachers are only paid half the amount of the honorarium in the last automated elections held in May.” He continued.Basas said that manual elections like the one in Monday would expose the teachers in more possible errors, physical and mental fatigue, health risks, legal trouble and threats of harassment and physical attck. Thus, according to him, teachers deserve more than the total of P2, 500.00. The TDC proposes a payment of at least P4, 000.00, the total amount Comelec paid the teachers who sit as members of BEI last May.”Basas also noted that the Comelec still failed to review and implement its legal mandate that prohibits the appointment of teachers who are not registered voters in the city or municipality as members of the BET.“Both the election code and the subsequent Comelec Resolutions including the one for this October 28 Barangay polls prohibit the non-registered voters of the locality to sit as members of election tellers, yet the Comelec, in many instances allowed this to happen. Our teachers who are actually compelled to do this duty may face a possible election offense.” Basas explained.Last week, teachers of Manila raised this issue and ask a Comelec representative during the training in Araullo High School, the Comelec personnel agreed that indeed there may be a violation but told them to address the concern to the Comelec national office.Aside from these two issues of compensation and legal protection, the group also appeal to the Comelec and the national government to ensure that teachers will be protected against physical harm. Basas noted that Barangay elections, most of the time, are most intense and tensionable due mainly to the clannish nature of Philippine villages and the opposing candidates and their supporters are coming from the same grassroots localities, some are actually blood relatives.“We call on the Comelec to ensure the visibility of law enforcement authorities in areas they declared as election hot spots, from the start of the teachers work until they have finished all the tasks including the transportation of election paraphernalia from Comelec centers to polling places and vise versa.” Basas said.Basas believe that the presence of law enforcers may deter those who are planning to disrupt the process thru violence, tension and disorder on election day.“The problem with the bad politics and ailing electoral system is, everything may be blamed to the teachers, the front liners in elections, as if we have a direct stake in it.” Basas lamented. “We are the hapless victims of pre-election harassment, we cannot just leave the polling precincts whenever violence erupts on election day and after the polls, we are also subjects of electoral protests filed by the losing candidates.”Basas added that most of the time, they face these difficulties alone for the DepEd has no readily available legal assistance and the Comelec serves as prosecutors in election-related cases.“We appeal to the candidates and the general public to please spare the teachers. We do this task because we consider this as our patriotic duty, aside from this is our mandated work as public school teachers. However, given the choice, many of us would be opted not to sit as BET and would not risk our profession, our safety, our limbs or even our lives.”The TDC is one of the most active organizations advocating the amendment to election laws to effect the relief of teachers from ‘hazardous non-teaching related assignments’ especially poll duties and make these optional.",

Taxi Driver: Eh naliliitan nga kayo sakin ehThe argument became worst when the father of Ashby instructed the taxi driver to park in a drug store to wait for them.The taxi driver compalined to his passengers that it’s already unfair to wait for them because he already wanted to grab new passenger.But the side of Ashby didn’t agreed and they insisted the driver to park his taxi in the drug store to wait for them without resetting the taxi meter.After that, the passengers and the driver brought the fight in front of the drug store where other people are watching.Before the video ended, the passenger also shown that they didn’t paid the taxi driver because he didn’t follow their request to wait for them.In her post, she also said that they ended up in a police precinct, but she didn’t record it anymore.The netizens reacted on the video posted by Ashby and instead of gathering support, she was criticized because of their rude attitude towards the taxi driver who’s only working for his family.Netizens said that Ashby’s post is not accurate in the video that they watched.Netizens also believed that there’s nothing wrong with the taxi driver did because he’s only defending his side from the alleged abusive passengers.They also criticized Ashby for not paying the taxi driver.About kakui15",

    "body": "Karla Estrada made waves online just last month when she admitted that she and “That’s Entertainment!” co-star Romnick Sarmenta dated during their stint at the popular 80’s show.Dubbed the “Queen Mother,” Karla is perhaps most popularly known by millennials as the mother of young actor Daniel Padilla. She has three other children, namely Jose Carlito, Carmela, and Margaret.Now, the Queen Mother has been making waves online again. This time, however, it’s all thanks to her ‘kusot‘ skills in doing the laundry!In a video that Karla posted on Instagram on December 10, the Queen Mother can be seen doing her family’s laundry by hand. She is joined by her adorable nephew, Jordan, whom she thanked in the video for helping her.The video was captioned:“Literal na may labada kami tuwing linggo! thank you Jordan for helping me. happy Sunday momshies! #dedmasanails#sarApmaglaba“The TV host and personality can be seen washing Daniel’s white clothes by hand, saying that white shirts are actually her favorite clothes to wash. Jordan, on the other hand, seemed busy playing with the bubbles. Karla told her fellow moms that she does this every Sunday and that they too should do it for their families.“Favorite ko ito talagang maglaba ng mga puti. Kaya ‘pag Sunday ‘pag may time maglaba, maglinis, magluto mga momshies!”She also said that having her cute nephew around made doing laundry much more fun, “Tapos may ganyan ka pang katulong. Nako! Say hi, Jordan!” On cue, Jordan smiled at the camera and said hi.Karla’s video earned mixed reactions from netizens. Some of them said that it was all just for show. They pointed out that Karla’s nails were too long and perfect to actually be doing laundry every week.However, not all reactions were negative as most netizens who commented on her video commended her for being so humble as to do her family’s laundry herself. They also defended her from those saying that it was just for show, claiming that it can be seen and heard from the way Karla scrubs (kusot) that she does in fact really know how to wash clothes by hand.Here are some of the comments on the Queen Mother’s viral video.Watch her slay her laundry game like a true queen here!Literal na may labada kami tuwing linggo!😂😂 thank you Jordan for helping me 😂😂😂 happy Sunday momshies!💜💜💜 #dedmasanails #sarApmaglaba A post shared by KARLA ESTRADA (@karlaestrada1121) on Dec 9, 2017 at 8:05pm PSTWhat can you say about Karla Estrada’s ‘kusot’ skills?

    "body": "Palm-fringed islands, balmy weather, luxury yachts moored in azure waters — offshore tax havens conjure up a wonderland for the well-heeled and their wealth.But a CBC investigation based on the Paradise Papers leak has found that millions of ordinary Canadians also have an interest in money parked in tax havens — almost certainly without knowing it.Seven of the country’s so-called Big 8 pension funds, representing more than 25 million workers, have used tax havens as they invest Canadians’ retirement savings, according to records in the huge leak of offshore financial documents made public last month.30 years ago… they didn’t need to structure things through the Bahamas. We can go back to that, and the pensioners will get half their pension – Jim Leech, ex-CEO of Ontario Teachers Pension PlanThis revelation underscores a delicate quandary. On the one hand, pension funds need to make enough money to ensure they can pay benefits to an aging population, and using tax havens for investments abroad can help the bottom line. But it raises questions about whether Canadians’ retirement money is underwriting an offshore industry that undermines tax fairness and transparency.The pensions’ high-profile offshore dealings include the 407 Highway north of Toronto, which the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought a 40 per cent stake in — partly through an entity in Bermuda. Or the high-speed rail line from London, England, to the Channel Tunnel, which a pair of Canadian pension funds owned until earlier this year via a shell company in Jersey, a tax haven in the Channel Islands.The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought a 40 per cent stake in Highway 407 north of Toronto, partly through an entity in Bermuda.None of the pension plans would say exactly how much of their revenue is generated by investments through tax havens. In response to questions from CBC, almost all of them pointed out that Canada doesn’t tax pension plans on their investment income, so their use of tax havens makes no difference to federal or provincial government coffers.But other countries have different tax rules, and some Canadian pension funds acknowledged that offshore investment structures help them legally minimize their tax burdens abroad. Some even said it’s their duty to do so in order to maximize savings available for retirees.“We structure our foreign investments to maximize the after-tax investment returns available to CPP contributors and beneficiaries,” the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) said in a statement, noting that 85 per cent of its assets are abroad.“CPPIB has a responsibility to over 20 million contributors and beneficiaries to seek a maximum rate of return to help sustain the CPP fund for multiple generations.”Major Canadian pension fund management bodies mentioned in the Paradise Papers:Canada Pension Plan Investment BoardCaisse de dépôt et placement du QuébecOntario Teachers Pension PlanOntario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS)Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments)British Columbia Investment Management CorporationAlberta Investment Management CorporationA former top pension executive said that while Canada’s major retirement funds used to invest nearly all of their assets domestically, it would be impossible to do so today and still generate the profits needed to pay decent benefits.“Thirty years ago, when all investments were in Canada by those pension plans, they didn’t need to structure things through the Bahamas,” said Jim Leech, CEO of the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan from 2007 to 2013. “We can go back to that, and the pensioners will get half their pension.”Jim Leech, ex-CEO of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, says Canada’s big pension funds need to invest abroad to make the money needed to pay retirees. (The Canadian Press Images)‘Absolutely unacceptable’That doesn’t resonate with Hassan Yussuff, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress and one of Canada’s most prominent voices for workers. Yussuff said Canadians’ pensions simply shouldn’t be invested in tax havens because of their notoriety as epicentres for tax dodging.“We want the tax system here to have credibility,” he said. “It’s absolutely unacceptable in terms of what we expect of pension funds, in terms of their ethical investment.”The federal government has repeatedly declared that it wants to make the tax system more fair — in part, the Finance Department says on its website, by efforts “to stop the use of tax havens.”Yussuff said it’s contradictory to keep pledging tax fairness and transparency while, simultaneously, the CPP — the federal pension plan — is enmeshed in some of the very tax havens that are the targets of tax fairness and transparency campaigns.CBC’s investigation found numerous examples of major Canadian pension funds using or investing in tax havens. Here’s a sample:If you contribute to CPP, or work for the federal government or the provincial public service in B.C., then you have a stake in Chile’s largest electricity company. That’s thanks to a $1.55-billion US joint takeover by the CPP Investment Board, the federal Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the B.C. Investment Management Corp. and a private sector company back in 2006. The transaction was routed through a corporation set up in zero-tax Bermuda, because the island territory was “tax neutral” for all the investors.The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and OMERS, the pension fund for hundreds of thousands of Ontario municipal workers, owned the High Speed 1 rail line in Britain until September, via a holding company also incorporated in Jersey. Neither pension fund would say why they did it that way.The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which invests the Quebec provincial pension plan as well as the pensions of many provincial and municipal employees, put money into a number of Cayman Islands companies in order to invest in North American financial markets and in an Israeli-managed venture capital fund. The Caisse said in a detailed statement that it obtained “no tax benefit” from the North American investments. The Israeli fund, it said, is one of many “regularly constituted” in certain tax-haven jurisdictions because of their efficient corporate laws, dependable legal systems and “a neutral taxation policy.”Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, says it’s contradictory for the federal government to pledge to fight the abuse of tax havens while, at the same time, Canada Pension Plan money is invested in them. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)$1 trillion in assetsCanada’s biggest pension funds have grown significantly in recent years in order to pay benefits to an increasing proportion of retirees. The Big 8 plans alone are now worth more than $1 trillion, and agencies like the CPP Investment Board, Ontario Teachers and Quebec’s Caisse are among the biggest institutional investors in the world.Couple that demographic trend with historically low interest rates on government and corporate bonds in Canada since the 2008 financial crisis, and pension fund managers have had to look outside the country to find investment returns to sustain retirees’ benefits, analysts say.And that has often meant using tax havens.Fund managers “must fund these pensions in a very difficult economic context,” said Chris Roberts, director of economic policy at the Canadian Labour Congress.He said that as a result, a lot of CLC’s members have “conflicted feelings about what their pension funds are doing, on the one hand, but also feeling like, ‘Is my pension going to be there for me as well?'”",

    "body": "Karla Estrada is a happy mom to Daniel, Jose, Carmela and Margaret. After a couple of failed relationships, the actress was able to raise all four kids by herself. With the unconditional love she has for them, there’s no denying that the ‘That’s Entertainment” alumna was successful in doing so.“Totoo iyon na na kapag naging mother ka na, marami ka ng takot. Mas takot ka na sa buhay mo, sa mga posibleng mangyari sa iyo. Nung dalaga ako napakatapang ko pero ngayon, iniingatan ko na ang buhay ko para sa kanila.”In fact, the actress didn’t just raise her children but she also established a close bond with them. That’s why, many fans might be interested to hear what the four kids think of their mother’s longtime boyfriend, Mark Yatco. Thanks to TV host Boy Abunda, an honest Karla aired the situation between them and her partner.Karla Estrada said:“They’re cool. Okay sila. “Kasi ang pagu-usap namin lagi ng mga bata, ako ang sinabi ko kay Mark, hindi nila maibibigay yung full time nila, ng mga anak ko. Ang importante, nirerespeto ka nila at gusto ka nila. Dahil syempre yung mga anak ko buhay naman ang kani-kanilang mga ama sa buhay nila eh. Ang importante, nabibigyan nila ng respeto si Tito Mark nila, which is yun ang nangyayari.”She revealed this as a guest on the late night talk show “Tonight With Boy Abunda” yesterday.This wasn’t the first time that the “Magandang Buhay” host talked about their romantic situation. Back in 2014, Karla introduced her non-showbiz boyfriend to audiences on the defunct morning talk show “Kris TV“. The two met at a mutual friend’s birthday party. During the talk, it was obvious how comfortable the couple was with each other.Kris Aquino asked how her children regard Mark.“The two boys, okay sila. Kasi natatawa naman sa kanya yung two boys ko, they’re relax lang. Yung girls, kasi siyempre ‘pag girls iba. Lalo na si Carmela, yayakap siya na parang, ‘Tayo muna mag-usap, mamaya na kayo ni mama.’ Makikita mo eh. Pero okay naman, walang ano [problema] kasi naa-adjust namin.” “Grabe lang yung adjustment. I think siyadin, naga-adjust din siya kasi siyempre as much as gusto niyang magkasama kami lagi, hindipwede. So naga-adjust siya dun sa part na yun.”All things considered, it’s nice to know how much Karla Estrada respects and thinks about her children before anything else.Watch the full interview here.What can you say about this statement from Karla Estrada? Do you hope that the actress and her longtime boyfriend would tie the knot soon? Let us know what you think and feel about this story by leaving a comment below!",

You are doing an amazing job.”In a blog post of Mr. Alon Calinao Dy, he said, “despite doing an outstanding work for the Filipinos and for the country, Duterte’s critics continue to him down.”But the famous Duterte’s quote “You Can Never Put A Good Man Down” was changed and quoted by Chief Justice Sereno ‘yellowtard’ supporters into “You Can’t Keep A Good Woman Down.”We’ve heard about this so many times that yellow minions tried to make wrong right. But the good thing is, Filipinos know the truth. Through the help of social media, Filipinos are well informed as they could say whatever they want to say— exercising the true freedom of speech.Not only Sereno had a quote like this but also Vice President Leni Robredo who said “The Last Man Standing is a Woman.”Enough is enough with all these lies and black propaganda of Liberal Party and yellow armies. Thanks God, Filipinos voted a right leader like President Duterte who’d fight against country’s problems of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption.",

    "body": "Persida AcostaDear PAO,I just want to seek some advice regarding my vacation leave credits. I am employed at present as an office secretary for a small private company in Parañaque City. Since I was hired in 2014, I have been enjoying five days of vacation leave credits. Members of my family are all residing abroad, so I normally do not go on vacation leave. Instead, the company just gives me the cash conversion of my unused leaves. My parents and siblings are all planning to come home this year, however. My friend told me that there is a service incentive leave. So, I was just wondering if I can avail of this leave considering that our company is already giving me five days of vacation leave credits. I really want to spend a lot of time with my family because I do not know when we will be able to have a reunion again. Please advise me on this matter.MandieDear Mandie,Taking personal time off from work is not entirely frowned upon under our laws. In fact, our laws recognize the importance of allowing private employees to take such time off to take care of their personal activities or endeavors by granting them the so-called service incentive leave benefits, with certain exceptions. As provided under the Labor Code of the Philippines:“ART. 95. Right to service incentive leave. – (a) Every employee who has rendered at least one year of service shall be entitled to a yearly service incentive leave of five days with pay.(b) This provision shall not apply to those who are already enjoying the benefit herein provided, those enjoying vacation leave with pay of at least five days and those employed in establishments regularly employing [fewer]than ten employees or in establishments exempted from granting this benefit by the Secretary of Labor and Employment after considering the viability or financial condition of such establishment. x x x” (Emphasis supplied)In the situation that you have shared with us, it is apparent that you have been with your company for more than a year now and that you are already permitted by your employer to avail of and enjoy an annual five-day vacation leave with pay. Accordingly, you can no longer avail of the service incentive leave benefits above-quoted, on top of what you are already enjoying right now.Perhaps what you can do is communicate with your employer of your desire to have additional leave credits in order for you to spend more time with your family. If your employer consents, such must be expressly provided under your contract of employment or any similar agreement. Once such agreement is executed and entered into by and between you and your employer, the latter may not, later on, withdraw or reduce the same because it is explicitly stated under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code:“SECTION 6. Relation to agreements. — Nothing in the Rule shall justify an employer from withdrawing or reducing any benefits, supplements or payments as provided in existing individual or collective agreements or employer’s practices or policies” (Rule V, Book Three, Id.).We hope that we were able to answer your queries. Please be reminded that this advice is based solely on the facts you have narrated and our appreciation of the same. Our opinion may vary when other facts are changed or elaborated.Editor’s note: Dear PAO is a daily column of the Public Attorney’s Office. Questions for Chief Acosta may be sent to dearpao@manilatimes.net.",

There has to be an actual violation of the law before you are arrested,” Tinio said.This after Duterte said he will order the arrest of political fronts of the rebel, which he lately declared as terrorists.ACT-Teachers Party and other left-wing party lists including Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN), Gabriela, et al, are considered political front of the rebel group CPP/NPA/NFF.Roque said in a statement on Thursday: “Even if they did not physically take up arms, if they are part of a conspiracy to commit acts of terror or rebellion, then they can be held liable under the theory of a conspiracy.”Tinio said this would lead to “trumped-up charges,” where activists belonging to legitimate political groups would be accused of involvement in ambushes by the belligerent New People’s Army. /Joy Valle/Source http://www.okd2.com/expect-npa-attacks-act-teachers-solon-warns-duterte/",

She pointed out that there was empirical data to support this claim.Robredo also pointed out that the country had an “imperfect” criminal justice system, raising the possibility that the innocent may be wrongly judged as guilty.The bill would also be anti-poor because most of those in death row were indigents who could not afford to hire a good lawyer, she added.

    "body": "Sen. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV. INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / RICHARD A. REYESThe Aquino family has nothing to do with the supposed scam that victimized thousands of people, who trooped to the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) after being promised that they will receive P1 million or gold bars from the Marcos family’s ill-gotten wealth.The camp of former President Benigno Aquino III issued this denial on Thursday, as the family said they will not entertain the claims made by former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. that the Aquinos are behind a demolition job against the Marcoses.“Pasensya na kay Senador Bongbong Marcos dahil ‘di namin kayang sumang-ayon sa pantasya nyang pagbigyan at pansinin sila,” former Aquino administration’s deputy spokesperson Abigail Valte said when sought for a reaction to Marcos’ statement.Meanwhile, Senator Bam Aquino said he was no longer surprised that Marcos would easily blame the Aquino family for any move to besmirch the reputation of the Marcoses.In a text message, the senator said: “Di naman nakakagulat na Aquino ang ituturo ni Ginoong Marcos. Kailan ba hinarap ng mga Marcos ang mga kasalanan nila sa taumbayan?”“Wala pong kinalaman ang mga Aquino sa scam na ‘yan,” he added.The opposition senator also took the chance to insist that the Liberal Party, where members of the Aquino family were stalwarts, was not behind any destabilization or ouster plot against President Rodrigo Duterte.“Hindi kami involved sa anumang ouster plot. Ang mga paratang na ‘yan ay gawa-gawa lamang,” he said.In a press conference in Quezon City on Thursday, Marcos alleged that the Aquinos are associated with the recent event at UPLB in Laguna where thousands showed up after being promised they will be given P1 million or gold bars from the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcos family.“I’m sure they (Aquinos) have something to do with it,” Marcos said.READ: Scam at UPLB Aquinos’ handiwork—Bongbong“Dito sa statement nila, batay din sa nangyari, ang tanong namin: Kung talagang iniingatan niya ang pangalan at legasiya ng ama nya, bakit di nya agarang ikondena ang mga nanloko sa ating mga kababayan? Di ba dapat syang sumama sa pagsampa ng kaso laban sa mga sumisira sa pangalan ng kanilang angkan?” Valte noted.Last month, the UPLB community was shocked when thousands of people, ferried on rented jeepneys and vans, showed up on the campus. They were holding plastic-covered booklets that had a picture of former President Ferdinand Marcos on the front cover and the words Bullion Buyer Ltd. on the back.READ: Thousands flock to UPLB to get P1M each ‘from Marcos wealth’The event was purportedly a general assembly organized by One Social Family Credit Cooperative. The booklet was supposedly published by Bullion Buyer Ltd.The booklet, which cost P30 each, contained writings about the alleged achievements of the late strongman. /kga",

    "body": "Two governors, two Congressmen and five mayors from the Visayas and Mindanao are now next targets of the Philippine National Police anti-drugs campaign, a deep source told Philippine Observer.A big-time businessman based in Cebu is also being hunted down by a special force created by the PNP to run after big-time drug lords and heads of criminal syndicates.Last year, Philippine president Rodrigo Roa Duterte exposed 130 names of people allegedly narcopoliticians. As of today, three high ranking government officials reportedly involved in drugs are dead.Ozamis city mayor Reynaldo Parojinog, his wife, his brother and 11 other close associates are killed after using force against police operatives who conducted an early dawn raid reportedly to serve warrants of arrest issued against the family. Parojinog’s daughter, Vice Mayor Nova Princess Echavez and his younger brother Rey Jr are now being held by cops while their uncle, Ricardo, is still missing.The raid against the Parojinogs came after an AFP general boasted in one gathering that Duterte and the PNP chief are helpless in stopping drug distribution reportedly controlled by the Parojinogs in Misamis Occidental. The Parojinogs reportedly supply the shabus being sold by Herbert Colangco inside Bilibid prisons.The source says their mission is to finally cut the distribution channels in the Visayas and Mindanao. Drug lords are using the unprotected sea lanes to distribute shabu worth billions manufactured locally into towns and cities of the Visayas and Mindanao.The flow and distribution of shabu remains intact due to alleged protection being provided by these narcopoliticians, the source says. PDEA sources say as much as 14 billion pesos exchange hands every month in the Philippines. Drug prices have fluctuated over the past months due to the PNP’s relentless anti-drugs drive. Inspite of higher priced metamphetamines, drug dependents estimated to be between 3-4 million Filipinos continue to consume the lethal drugs.sourceCommentscomments",

Nakakalungkot isipin dahil yung mga matanda na kung sino payung nakaranas sa hagip ng martial law sila pa yung nanahimik,\" Paredes said.“Tapos yung mga taga-Mindanao na taong bundok sila pa yung gusto na mag martial law dahil alam nila na hindi sila ang malalagay sa alanganin kundi kami taga luzon,” he added.>This statement of Paredes just made him even harder to be like by Filipino people. It has sparked outrage from the netizens and here are some of their response;Lyn Dilangalen: Dear Mr. Jim Paredes, you're one of the heck tarantado to da maximum level. We, the \"Taga-bundok\" people are never bothered by the Martial Law implemented in Mindanao. In fact, we prefer that! It is for the good and safety of the Mindanao populace. Why would you think the Luzon will be put to alanganin? So please shut and get a life. May God bless you and lessen too much air in your head. Purbida kaaaaa!Remigio Rojas: Jim Paredes. Graduate ka nga sa Ateneo pero kulang ka sa edukasyon! Kung ang pag pabor sa ML sa Mindanao ay ugali ng isang taga bundok, tiyak ako ay isang taga bundok. Please never underestimate Mindanao. For your info, all the branches of government are now in the hands of people from Mindanao. The President is from Davao City. The Senate President is from Cagayan de Oro/Misamis. The Speaker of the House is from Davao Region and the Chief Justice is from Zamboanga. Need I say more?Beth N. Ramos: Ano ba ang itsura ng taga Mindanao na \"taong bundok\"? JIM PAREDES, this is not an insult to the Mindanaons. This is an insult that backfires to your being. Idolo pa naman kita noon. It appears now na wala kang pinagkatandaan. Shame on you!Jocelyn Nefiel: I really don't subscribe to ranting on social media but this post really got my goat!This person seems to have forgotten that he is where he is now because it was a Mindanaoan who first gave him and his group their break in the music industry - it was JEM Records (owned by the late Chito Ayala of Davao City) that first signed Apo Hiking Society (apologies to Danny Javier and Buboy Garovillo) as a recording artists. Yes, it was this \"taga bundok\" company that gave you a break! Speaking of \"walang utang na loob\"! Not everything is about you! Please stop harping back to the Marcos era martial law and read the 1987 Constitution!.... thank you Long Pineda for posting.....grabeh na talaga maka lait si Jim Paredes.... bundok jud ang Mindanao???? grabeh na jud sya oSo what can you say about this one?

But much more than this, Rachel is a proud Dutertard.Peters is a girlfriend of Camarines Sur Governor Migz Villafuerte (Liberal Party) but she is still vocal about supporting President Rody Duterte who she described as the ‘Best President ever in the country’.In her earlier interview before she flew to Las Vegas to compete, she told the media and her followers that we all should trust the President.“We should trust in our President and trust that it’s he (who) knows what is best for our country.” – Rachel said.She even defended Usec for Social Media Mocha Uson when asked about the former dancer’s performance as a government employee.“Well, she hasn’t started yet. And so, I believe everyone should be given a chance. You cannot judge a book by its cover, (That is) something my parents taught me that is still in my mind,” she said.Comedian Vice Ganda along with other celebrities have been calling their followers to show full support the journey of Rachel. Vice Ganda and his friends woke up early just to watch Miss Universe 2017 tweeting his support to Rachel.Being in the Top 10 is still an achievement.

Therefore, when a big-time celebrity like Vice Ganda went shopping in SM Megamall – a known public mall that caters to everyone – he immediately caught everyone’s attention.The incident was caught on cam and shared by YouTube user “The PINOY Channel.” As of this writing, it has gained 126,891 views, 1,000 likes, and around 198 comments from the online community. Their description reads:“Unkabogable star Vice Ganda, nagshopping sa megamall! Sobrang bait ni Vice ang laki ng patience niya dahil kahit madaming papicture ng papicture binibigyan niya padin sila ng time. Saludo talaga kay ate Vice!”Vice Ganda is known to be close to the masses but he is rarely seen visiting public hangouts such as SM Megamall. As such, it was understood that he would gain attention from people.He walked into “Home” section of the Department Store and stopped whenever someone would take a picture with him. The comedian went on to inspect a kettle and gestured to the camera, particularly to the one who held it.Based on the exchange of conversation that occurred, he was a bit surprised that the video was recording him “live.” Then he said, “Gusto kong bumili ng takore, ano ba” with a smile.he continued to scour the particular section and stopped in front of refrigerators. He gestured to the one taking the video, “Tingin mo kailangan ko ng ref, ha?”Then the person said, “TV. TV mas kailangan mo.”Vice Ganda walked on as the person laughed but he stopped once again when a particular refrigerator caught his attention.Meanwhile, netizens who watched the video stated that he seemed “simple” since he would shop in a public mall without any qualms. Some of them commented that the comedian was probably dizzy from the walking and picture-taking from the fans.Watch the shopping excursion of the comedian below:What do you think about this, readers?

    "body": "The Aga Khan could face an investigation into allegations he violated Canada’s Lobbying Act by giving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family free vacations on his private island in the Bahamas at the same time as he was discussing funding for projects.Democracy Watch sent a letter to the Commissioner of Lobbying late Wednesday, urging her to investigate whether Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan IV “violated the Lobbyists Code by giving Prime Minister Trudeau and Liberal MP Seamus O’Regan the gifts of trips to his island home.”In the letter, Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher says the Aga Khan’s actions have put Trudeau and O’Regan in a conflict of interest. It is also against the law to give a public office holder a gift that could create a sense of obligation.“Your position must be that anyone working for or associated with a company that is registered to lobby a public office holder who gives to or does anything for that office holder… that is more than an average voter does… puts that office holder in an apparent conflict of interest,” he wrote.The Aga Khan is the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Muslims and is listed as a member of the board of directors of the Aga Khan Foundation Canada. The foundation, which has received millions of dollars in federal government development aid over the years, is registered to lobby several federal government departments including the Prime Minister’s Office, although the Aga Khan is not listed among those registered to lobby on its behalf.Trudeau meets with the Aga Khan on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on May 17, 2016. Dawson ruled Wednesday that the PM should have recused himself from part of the meeting. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)A search of the lobbyist registry shows the foundation has filed 132 reports since 2011 outlining its meetings with government decision makers. However, none of those reports list any meetings with Trudeau.Representatives of the Aga Khan Foundation of Canada contacted by CBC News have yet to comment.The call for a lobbying investigation comes in the wake of a scathing report by Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson on Wednesday.Dawson found that Trudeau violated four sections of the Conflict of Interest Act when he accepted a vacation on the island in the Bahamas and a ride in the Aga Khan’s personal helicopter.While Trudeau and his family got a tropical vacation, Canadian taxpayers got a bill for more than $215,000 in transportation and staffing costs — far more than the government initially disclosed to Parliament.A terrace on the Aga Khan’s property overlooks the turquoise-blue waters of the Bahamas. (CBC)Dawson also revealed that Trudeau’s trip during last year’s Christmas holidays was one of three that Trudeau or members of his family had made to the island. Dawson disclosed that Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau stayed on the island in March 2016 with a friend and their children.Neither the Aga Khan, nor any member of his family, was on the island during their stay.Dawson said the Aga Khan was on the island during the Trudeaus’ Christmas-time visit last year as was a “senior American official of a previous administration,” who she did not name.In her report, Dawson describes the relationship between Trudeau and the Aga Khan, the times they met and the questions they discussed.Among them was a bilateral meeting on May 17, 2016 that was arranged by “representatives” of the Aga Khan. After a 15-minute chat between the two men about “personal matters, the Ismaili community in general and geopolitics,” they were joined by three of the Aga Khan’s representatives, Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly, staff members from the Prime Minister’s Office and senior officials of the Privy Council Office.A wooden pathway leads to a scenic lookout on Bell Island in the Bahamas. (CBC)Dawson’s report says the government had found a funding mechanism to allow it to contribute to the Global Centre for Pluralism’s endowment fund and Trudeau reaffirmed the government’s $15 million commitment during the meeting.The Aga Khan’s pitch for government funding for a $200 million riverfront renewal plan in Ottawa was also discussed.Dawson ruled that Trudeau should have recused himself from two discussions in May 2016 involving the $15 million grant.“Two months prior to the May 2016 occasions, Mr. Trudeau’s family accepted a gift from the Aga Khan that might reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau in the exercise of an official power, duty or function as Prime Minister,” she wrote.Looking out from Bell Island in the Bahamas at night. (CBC)“For this reason, the discussions with the Privy Council Office and later with the Aga Khan about the outstanding $15 million grant to the endowment fund provided an opportunity to improperly further the private interests of the Global Centre for Pluralism.”While the Aga Khan is not paid to lobby government (one of the criteria under the law) Conacher said he believes the Aga Khan violated the lobbying rules. Otherwise, it would create a giant loophole, he said.“Every single corporation, business, union, non-profit organization would start using board members to give gifts to politicians if this loophole were opened up by the lobbying commissioner.”Conacher is also calling for outgoing lobbying commissioner Karen Shepherd and incoming lobbying commissioner Nancy Bélanger to recuse themselves from ruling on the investigation because of the way Shepherd’s contract was renewed and the way Bélanger was chosen in “a secretive, PMO-controlled process.”Manon Dion, spokeswoman for the lobbying commissioner’s office, said she cannot reveal whether they are already looking into the issue.Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca",

Anyare?The news is from Inquirer, na sinamahan si Lascanas paalis.This is the news bit. (All parentheses are my annotations, I mean, bitchy side comments.)Davao Death Squad witness Arturo Lascañas leaves PH for safetyBy: Nikko Dizon - Reporter / @NikkoDizonINQPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:14 PM April 09, 2017Retired SPO3 Arturo Lascañas, relaxed and well-rested, talks to the Inquirer on Sunday morning (Apr. 9, 2017) at the dining area of a rented place in an undisclosed location, which for now he has to call home.(ME: WHO PAID FOR HIS TICKETS AND DOWNPAYMENT/ADVANCE FOR HIS RENT? ABER)UNDISCLOSED LOCATION — Arturo Lascañas, the self-confessed member of the Davao Death Squad (DDS) who implicated President Duterte in the group’s grisly executions, silently left the Philippines on Saturday night.“I have received threats that a lawsuit would be filed against me, and there are also people looking for me as well,” Lascañas told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.(ME: LAWSUIT LANG LAYAS KA KAAGAD? SINO NAMAN ANG MAGHAHANAP SA IYO? AS IF.)Lascañas said the moment he received these pieces of information, it dawned on him that it was better to leave the country “for the time being.”(ME: YAN ANG GUSTO KO SA INYONG MGA TAGA LP. ANG TAPANG NINYO. TAKBO AGAD. SI LASCANAS ANG PINAKA LUGING INVESTMENT NG LP KASI WALANG MAY NANIWALA.)As a security measure, the retired policeman requested the Philippine Daily Inquirer to withhold his whereabouts, even if the Philippine government certainly knew by then where he was because he properly filled out his immigration form.(ME: MAY COMPLETE ADDRESS BA ANG IMMIGRATION FORM? FROM HIS DESTINATION, BAWAL NA BA LUMIPAT AT MAG FLY TO ANOTHER LOCATION? KUNYARI PA BRAVE SA PAGSIWALAT KUNG NASAAN.)The INQUIRER asked Lascañas if he left because he took on the President, simply the most powerful man in the country.(ME: NAKS SA PAG STRESS SA \"SIMPLY THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE COUNTRY.\" PARA ANO, STUDY OF CONTRASTS BETWEEN POOR, TERRIFIED LASCANAS AND DUTERTE THE POWERFUL? PARANG HINDI SI DUTERTE ANG POWERFUL. PRESIDENTE SIYA PERO DI SIYA KASING POWERFUL NG MGA OLIGARKIYANG NAGPAPATAKBO SA INYO.)“I’m not confronting him. I was just telling the truth, the whole truth about the killings in Davao, (and about) my involvement, because I want to have a clean conscience,” Lascañas said.(ME: CLEAN CONSCIENCE O CLEAN KIDNEY? CLEAN KIDNEY! KA CHING KA CHING KA CHING)In February, Lascañas made a stunning turnaround from his statements last year at a Senate investigation where he denied involvement in the DDS, as well as allegations made by another self-confessed DDS member, Edgar Matobato.(ME: NEGOSYO LUGI KAY LASCANAS. WALANG CREDIBILIDAD. WEHHHH WEHHH WEEEHHH)Lascañas admitted to lying when he first appeared at the Senate, saying he did so out of fear for his family’s safety.(ME; WHERE'S YOUR FAMILY AGAIN? TOTOO PO BA NA OUT OF THE COUNTRY NA SILA BAGO KA BUMALIKTAD? TOTOOO BAHHHHHH)In his press conference on Feb. 20, Lascañas accused President Duterte of organizing the DDS to kill petty criminals and his enemies in Davao City. He was then assisted by his lawyers from the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) led by its national chairman Jose Manuel Diokno, and supported by opposition Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV.From then on, Lascañas had been provided safe haven by a number of supporters, some of whom helped him in his flight out of the country over the weekend.(ME: KUNYARI PA KAYO. MATAGAL NANG MAY NAG AANTAY NA \"SAFE HAVEN.\" SUPER DIKTADOR SI DUTERTE ANO? HINAHAYAANG MAKALABAS NG BUHAY ANG MGA \"WITNESSES?\" WOW, WHAT A MAGIC.)Malacañang had denied the allegations Lascañas made, saying these were part of the plan to “destroy the President and topple his administration.”Briefly on Saturday, Lascañas thought he would not be able to leave.(ME: EH PERO NAKAALIS PA RIN, SO ANO ITO, DRAMATICS? PAMPAHABA NG ARTICLE)He had to wait for around 15 minutes at the airport immigration before his passport was stamped.(ME: ANG SWERTE NAMAN 15 MINUTES LANG. CLINECLEAR LANG NA WALANG KASO. WAWANG LASCANAS.)“They didn’t talk to me. They just told me to take a seat. They didn’t tell me why,” Lascañas said of the immigration officers.(ME: GANON TALAGA.)One of them told the INQUIRER that they had no reason to prevent him from leaving. (The Inquirer took the same flight with Lascañas.)They just had to “inform” the Bureau of Immigration headquarters that an Arturo Lascañas was at one of the immigration counters.(ME: AND THE POINT OF USING THE \"QUOTES\" IS?)“The immigration staff were actually polite and even apologetic,” Lascañas said, adding however, that the immigration officer took note of his full itinerary.He was confident that he should be allowed to leave because he had no hold departure order. He was not even on the immigration watchlist.On Sunday morning at a rented place, which for now he would call home, Lascañas looked well rested and relaxed.(ME: IF I HAD--REPORTEDLY LANG NAMAN--- MILLIONS IN THE BANK I WOULD BE RELAXED AND RESTED TOO. ISIPIN MO, DRAMA DRAMA LANG NG KONTI, ABROAD AGAD, BAGONG BUHAY, PLUS MAY PABAON PA. SHEREP.)With his companions and the INQUIRER, Lascañas went out to walk around his new neighborhood and to have brunch.(ME: NAKS, BRUNCH. LASCANAS WILL NOW OFFICIALLY BE A STEPFORD WIFE.)This was the first time in two months that he was able to walk some distance, and without tight security, he said. Lascañas and his companions navigated their way with pure joy.(ME; WE ARE SO GLAD YOU NOW EXPERIENCE THE PURE JOY BROUGHT ABOUT BY SUCH WEALTH... OF EXPERIENCE.)To be unafraid was exhilarating for them.This was his very first time to be out of the Philippines, and Lascañas said he had mixed feelings about it.“Siempre masaya dahil na-allow ako makaalis. Malungkot naman dahil first time ko nakaalis. Siempre kahit papano, mahal natin ang bansa natin,” Lascañas said.(ME: WAIT WHAT?! FIRST TIME OUT OF THE COUNTRY?!!! PERO SABI NINYO ANG LAKI NG BAYAD NI DUTERTE SA INYO NG MGA PULIS KAYO. MAGKANO ULIT? 100,000 A MONTH PLUS YUNG MGA EXTRA PER KILL? SAN NAPUNTA, EH MAHIRAP PA DIN NAMAN KAYO SA DAVAO, WALA NAMAN KAYONG MAGARANG BAHAY, AT MOST IMPORTANTLY, DI MAN LANG KAYO NAKAPAG HONG KONG?! O, ANG KURIPOT NAMAN PALA MAGBIGAY SI DUTERTE PER KILL.)With his handkerchief, Lascañas, a man who admitted to have killed hundreds on orders of then Mayor Duterte, wiped away the tears that rolled down his cheeks.(ME: MAY TOPAK NA ATA ITONG SI LASCANAS. WALKING AROUND HIS NEIGHBORHOOD--WITH PURE JOY, KAMO--WHILE WIPING THE TEARS THAT ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS. ANE BE TELEGE, KUYA)Lascañas knew it would take a long time before he could return to the Philippines.“I am sure, I might either be jailed or killed. It’s just one of the two possibilities. But for me, I know God has a plan and that would be my destiny for telling the truth. I have accepted that,” Lascañas said.(ME: SANA LANG DI KA IPAPATAY DIYAN NG MGA TAONG ALAM KUNG NASAAN KA. PAPATAHIMIKIN KA DAHIL SA ALAM MO. PARANG LALAKING NANGANGABIT LANG YAN: KUNG PUWEDE MO TRAYDURIN SI DUTERTE, ALAM NILANG PUWEDE MO RIN SILA TRAYDURIN. KAYA GOOD LUCK SA YO KUYA.)Being human, he said, he also haD fears and uncertainties. “But all that will be overcome by one’s faith. To me, God is my guide. I know (God) will not abandon me,” Lascañas said. SFM(ME: YUNG MGA PARING KASING TRAYDOR MO, MAHILIG DIN MAG TAKE NG NAME OF GOD IN VAIN.

    "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a unilateral ceasefire with communist rebels this Christmas season, Malacañang said Wednesday.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. said the President announced the suspension of military operations (SOMO) against the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) Tuesday night.He said the SOMO would run from December 24, 2017 to January 2, 2018 and the Palace expects the communist rebels to return the favor.“This unilateral ceasefire would lessen the apprehension of the public this Christmas season. We expect that the CPP-NPA-NDFP would do a similar gesture of goodwill,” Roque said in a statement.“Christmas holds a special place in the hearts of our countrymen. In the observance of this occasion, we hope that all Filipinos would stand together as one nation and aspire for peace in our beloved Philippines,” he added.Earlier, Duterte said he was not keen on declaring a Christmas truce with the communist rebels following continued attacks against state security forces.However, the President said early Wednesday that if ever he declares a holiday truce, it would be out of consideration for the well-being of the Filipino people.“Look, if I declare a ceasefire, it is not addressed to the NPAs. Rather, I would want to celebrate Christmas with the rest of humankind or Filipinos na walang stress,” he said in a media interview at the wake of Police Officer 3 Wilfredo Gueta.“Baka sabihin nila walang ceasefire ngayon, baka magkaputukan. Then you put a lot of strain on the people. I will think about it. That would be my primary consideration,” Duterte said.The President added that “the ceasefire is a unilateral action of government to refrain from attacking.”This was seconded by the Department of National Defense (DND) which said that the SOMO pertains only to combat operations.",

The healthy exchange of opposing views is crucial in a democracy,” Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a Liberal Party (LP) member, said.Zero allocations are projected to punish and silence opposition legislators even as it is their constituencies who are deprived of the benefits of infrastructure development,” Albay Representative Edcel Lagman said in a seperate statement.Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Representative Villarin condemned President Rodrigo Duterte for his ‘revenge’ against the opposition who criticized his policies including the war against illegal drugs.He said that President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent moves ‘speak much about the dictatorial tendencies of this administration,’.Caloocan Representative Egay Erice said that he would fight until the ‘last drop’ of his blood to protect the people who will be affected by the budget cut.“I will fight to the last drop of my blood before the courts and on the streets if necessary to protect the 8 million Filipinos who will be benefitting from the projects,” he said in a statement.Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno clarified that the lawmakers will not get zero budgets, however the supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte will given more funds for their projects.“If you’re with us then you get something. If you’re not with us then you don’t get something… Allies will get more. More projects,” Diokno saidPresident Rodrigo Duterte is not yet giving any comments on the slash budget for the opposition members.It’s not the first time that the congress used the ‘zero budget’ against the critics of the government.Several months ago, Commission on Human Rights were nearly given a zero budget by the congress, however it was reversed after receiving criticisms from the public.",

    "body": "Former President Benigno Aquino III gave his opening statement during the senate blue ribbon committee’s investigation on the Dengvaxia controversy.In his opening statement, Aquino explained that the reason why he was attracted by the vaccine made by Sanofi is because of the increasing cases of Dengue in the Philippines that need to be resolve immediately.He recounted that he visited Paris on December 2015, to attend a Climate Change conference when he was informed that the vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur against Dengue was ready.Aquino also said that the people think that when they were vaccinated by Dengvaxia, there’s a big possibility that they might possibly die because of severe dengue.Opening Statement of Former President Noynoy Aquino during the Senate Investigation on Dengvaxia controversy.He pointed out the the role of the government is to keep the people calm and explain to them that they don’t need to panic over the controversy.“Sa lahat po ng usapin ngayon ukol sa Dengvaxia, kung di man diretsong sinasabi, ang pakiwari ay kung nagpa-bakuna ka, tila nalalapit ka sa pinakamalubhang uri ng Dengue. Tila nalalapit ka sa kamatayan.” Aquino said.“Kung tatakutin mo nang husto ang tao, darating ang punto na di na sila makakakilos dahil sa kaba. Klaro po sa amin noon , trabaho ng gobyerno na pakalmahin at suportahan ang Pilipino, kaya nung Pangulo ako, kinastigo ko ang mga opisyal na mahilig magpakaba ng sambayanan.” he added.Aquino explained that if Sanofi didn’t fail in their vaccine, the people might complaint to him that his administration didn’t gave them the anti-dengue vaccine.No one also protested against the anti-Dengue vaccination program of the government before the announcement of Sanofi Pasteur.“Kung di lumabas itong sianbi ng Sanofi, at nagdesisyon akong hayaan na lang na magdusa pa ng karaniwang Pilipino, gayong may bakuna na, palagay ko ngayon, iba na ang tanong ninyo at asunto sakin: Bakit mo pinabayaan ang kababayan mo?” he said.According to him, in a worst case scenario, if 2.8 million Filipinos suffered in Dengue, it might cost the government to spend 58.2 billion pesos to give them free medical treatment, compared the the P3.5-B cost of the vaccination program against the deadly fever.In the last part of his opening statement, Aquino said that he vowed to leave the Philippines a better place before his term ended, so he also made a way to resolve the increasing cases of Dengue in the Philippines.“Nangako akong iiwan ko ang Pilipinas na mas maganda kesa sa aking dinatnan. Kaakibat noon ang pagbawas sa gastos at kaba at pasanin ng aking mga Boss, ang sambayanang Pilipino.” Aquino said.Parents of the children who got vaccinated, raised alarm after Sanofi Pasteur announced that a person who got vaccinated by Dengvaxia is possibly got a ‘severe dengue’ if they don’t have any history of Philippine Hemorrhagic Fever.Its estimated that 700,000 people were vaccinated by Dengvaxia.Philippines and Brazil are the only countries in the world that distributed the anti-dengue vaccine to the public.An official of Department of Health believed that the procurement of the Dengvaxia were rushed by the Aquino administration.“Sa loob ng tatlong buwan, napagalaw nila ang P3 billion na procurement, eh napakabilis noon,” Former Health Undersecretary Susan Mercado said.“Kung magpapatakbo kayo ng pagpapabakuna, dalawang taon ‘yan,” he added.The vaccination program began on April 2016, just a month before the May presidential elections.Commentscomments",

    "body": "/ / in local news, Parojinogs' connection to LP revealed by a UST alumnus?, politics /Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog and Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog-Echavez | Photo from Inquirer NewsAfter the death of the Ozamis City Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog and 14 others in the recent drug raid conducted by CIDG, many suspected that it has something to do with their political connections.University of Sto. Tomas alumnus, Mark Lopez, went back to as far as the start of presidential race to analyze the links of this story to the slain Mayor’s past involvement on drugs after Parojinog was named by Duterte as one of the narco-politicians. Read his full post below.Fact check: In the presidential race, Duterte lost in five (5) Mindanao provinces out of of 27.These five provinces are Misamis Occidental, Camiguin, Agusan del Sur, Zamboanga Del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur.It was Mar Roxas of the LP who won in these provinces, except for Zamboanga del Sur, which went to Grace Poe.Duterte also lost in four (4) cities in Mindanao, out of 33.The four are Lamitan (Basilan), Bayugan (Agusan del Sur), Tangub (Misamis Occidental) and ....Ozamiz City, also in Misamis Occidental.In all of these four cities, Mar Roxas was the winner.Now why am I bringing this up?Today, a dynasty in Ozamiz city with strong ties to narcotics, kidnapping, bank robberies and other heinous crimes were swept and felled down in a daring and SEAL-team like raid by the PNP.It has been said that this family has lorded it over in Ozamiz, and has made this city a major drug distribution haven in Mindanao. It should also be noted that this is the family who started the infamous Kuratong Baleleng crime syndicate.Again, Mar Roxas and the LP won in Ozamiz, which is just one of four Mindanao cities out of 33 where Duterte lost.Do I still need to say \"connect the dot?\"Or is it clear?(UPDATE as of 11:43 pm -- Consistently, in all five provinces and four cities mentioned here, except for Zamboanga del Sur, Leni Robredo also won as the VP. Marcos won in Zambo del Sur)#GalawangDilawan***end of post***Source: Mark Lopez Facebook",

Even before Winwyn was born…in fact, she was still in her mom’s tummy…she was already declared a winner by her parents, Joey Marquez and Alma Moreno.“At that time, during the 1992 elections,” Alma recalled to Funfare, “Joey was running for vice mayor in Parañaque and I was heavy with Winwyn who turned out to be our lucky baby. Joey won so we decided to nickname the baby Winwyn. Joke ni Joey ‘yon during the campaign. Could you imagine kung ano ang naging nickname niya kung natalo si Joey.” (After serving as vice mayor, Joeyran and won mayor and served three terms.)Born on May 4, 1992, Winwyn was named Teresita Ssen Lacsamana Marquez — Teresita after Joey’s mom, Ssen is Alma’s nickname Ness spelled backwards and Lacsamana is Alma’s real surname.That luck must have sustained Winwyn during the Reina Hispano-Americana pageant in Bolivia where she bested the more than two dozen gorgeous Latinas at their turf and ran away with the title, the first ever Filipina (and from Asia) to score that victory…and the only candidate who required an interpreter for her well-thought-out answer (to the question: How would you promote Hispanic Americana culture with language barriers?): Language can be learned, but the will and determination to contribute something to the organization cannot.It has to come from the heart and it has to be natural. I believe that kindness is a universal language. If you treat people with tolerance, patience and love, you will understand each other. Hispanic culture is not about language only. It’s about love for God, love for country, love for history and culture, and love for family. As a Filipina with a unique heritage, I have instilled that.With her parents Joey Marquez (left) and mom Alma Moreno (right). With her parents Joey Marquez (left) and mom Alma Moreno (right).I am ready to promote the Hispanic culture not just in Asia but in the whole world. It is time to celebrate the Hispanic culture. It is meant to be celebrated.That intelligent answer helped Winwyn clinch the title.Told that Winwyn took after her (mana sa Nanay), Alma texted back, “Sa pagsayaw, oo!”Joey and Alma watched the pageant on YouTube, and Joey became more and more nervous as the names of the 10 semi-finalists were announced and then asked the crucial question in the Q&A segment, until the winners were announced.“I ran to the Comfort Room,” Joey told Ambet Nabus and Gretchen Fullido Sunday night on DZMM. “But I could hear the sound. I ran out only after Winwyn was announced the winner,” adding that he allowed Winwyn to join the pageant on the condition that she finished a Ph.D in Education and put up her own pre-school. “I told her that we would save for that school.”Of course, beauty runs in the family. Besides Alma, among Winwyn’s aunts are Via Marquez-Hoffman and (1979) Miss International Melanie Marquez who said that she constantly reminded Winwyn to “always feel the crown on her head every time she is seen publicly.”In Culion, Palawan, with Mabuhay Deseret Foundation (and with local surgeons Dr. BG Alcantara, Dr. Lito Alava, Dr. Zaldy Ong and Dr. Fiona) for a free operation on children with cleft palate and cleft lips as their charity advocacy, Melanie texted Funfare: Winwyn is a natural; she’s a sweet,friendly, compassionate and smart lady who is humble. I told her to give her best, to know the culture of the country, to pray and represent the Philippines with pride. She deserved to win because she worked hard for the pageant. Her humility and determination paid off. She exuded the aura of a queen. With or without a crown, she is a pride of the Marquez Family.2017 Bb.

Shoot them because we indeed are in a narcotics emergency position now,” Widodo said in a speech delivered at an event held by one of Indonesia’s political parties late on Friday.His remarks have drawn comparison to that of the Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte, who launched a brutal anti-drug crackdown about a year ago that saw many alleged drug dealers killed.The bloody campaign in the Philippines has drawn condemnation from the international community, including the United Nations.Indonesia also has tough laws against drugs. Widodo has previously been criticized for ordering executions against convicted drug traffickers who were given a death penalty by the court. Rights activists and some governments have called on Indonesia to abolish the death penalty.Friday’s shooting order from Widodo came a week after Indonesian police shot dead a Taiwanese man in a town near the capital Jakarta.The man, who was part of a group trying to smuggle one tonne of crystal methamphetamine into the country, was killed for resisting arrest, police have said.After the incident, Indonesian National Police chief Tito Karnavian was quoted by media saying he had ordered officers not to hesitate shooting drug dealers who resist arrest. — Reuterssource: GMA NEWSCommentscomments",

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)PHILADELPHIA — Zach Randolph and Vince Carter have been playing for so long that some of their teammates were toddlers when they broke into the NBA.That double dose of experience worked out quite well for Sacramento on Tuesday night.Randolph scored 27 points and Carter had two key plays late in the game, helping the Kings to a 101-95 victory over the slumping Philadelphia 76ers.Buddy Hield had 24 points and Frank Mason III finished with 16 for Sacramento, which came back from a 16-point second-half deficit.“Zach started us out and really carried us for a while,” Kings coach Dave Joerger said. “He was really, really terrific.”The 36-year-old Randolph was rejuvenated after he rested during Sunday’s 108-93 loss at Toronto. He made 12 of 19 shots and grabbed five rebounds.“He’s an amazing low-post threat, for a long period of time,” Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said.Besides putting up solid numbers — Randolph entered leading the team in scoring and rebounding at 15.2 points and 7 boards per game — he is enjoying his role as veteran leader.“We get along well,” he said. “These kids are working, they’re playing hard, and it’s showing on the court. We believe in them.”Ben Simmons had 13 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists for Philadelphia, which lost for the seventh time in eight games while playing without center Joel Embiid for the second straight night due to a back injury. Robert Covington led the 76ers with 17 points.Philadelphia looked out of sync without Embiid and Sacramento took advantage.Hield gave the Kings a 79-78 lead with a 3-pointer with 9:48 remaining. Carter made a full-court outlet pass to Garrett Temple for a layup that made it 92-86 Sacramento with 4:18 left.The 40-year-old Carter made another crucial play down the stretch, hustling for an offensive rebound that led to Randolph’s jumper with 1:59 to play.“Coach trusts me to be solid and consistent, not make mistakes and help our guys when I can,” Carter said. “I’ve been in big situations so I enjoy being on the court.”Simmons answered with a driving basket that made it 96-92, but he couldn’t convert the free throw after being fouled and the rally fizzled from there.“I don’t think we’ve been focusing down the stretch — missing shots, not calling the right plays,” Simmons said. “It’s just little things like that. It comes down to us focusing, and making sure we’re committed to defense and offense at the same time.”EMBIID’S ABSENCEEmbiid did not travel with the team to Chicago for Monday’s 117-115 loss to the Bulls. He was expected to play against the Kings on the second night of back-to-back games, but Brown said the team’s medical staff advised him to keep the 7-foot center on the sideline.The injury has kept Embiid out for four of the last six games. Brown said Embiid’s back “is still a little bit sore.”BROWN ON OKAFORJahlil Okafor, whom Philadelphia traded to Brooklyn earlier this month, made headlines in New York on Tuesday for saying he was glad to be with an organization that had “an actual NBA coaching staff.”“Jahlil knows what we did here,” Brown said before the loss. “It’s a young person who gave a quote. … I think everybody understands how we treat people here and the attention he received while he was here.”TIP-INSKings: G George Hill (illness) did not play. … Malachi Richardson had three points in 19 minutes after not playing Sunday due to an ankle injury. … G De’Aaron Fox was back in the lineup after missing Sunday’s game at Toronto due to a bruised right thigh, but he didn’t return after re-injuring it in the first half. He had two points in 11 minutes.76ers: Embiid last played in Philadelphia’s nationally televised game against Oklahoma City on Friday night, finishing with 34 points, eight rebounds and six assists in the 76ers’ 119-117 triple-overtime loss. … Prior to the game, the 76ers honored Philadelphia native and South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley. The Gamecocks play at Temple on Thursday night. … J.J. Redick left after injuring his hamstring. He had eight points in 15 minutes.UP NEXTKings: Finish four-game road trip at Brooklyn on Wednesday night.Sixers: Host Toronto on Thursday night in the first game of a home-and-home series. Philadelphia will play at the Raptors on Saturday night.",

    "body": "“Kulam” is a form of witchcraft or folk magic in the Philippines. In this modern world, however, this practice of sorcery is mostly seen on television or books or deemed as fiction despite the fact that there have been many incidents claiming that this is real. Such as the case of this woman who was allegedly under a dark spell for five years, became blind for six months, and experienced other sorts of physical tortures, all because of an extended family member’s envy.In a lengthy Facebook post of online user Nick Banayo, who claims to be a faith healer and the one who allegedly defeated the woman’s “mangkukulam“, he narrated what the victim has gone through while she was bewitched for a long time. He detailed that the witchcraft had her experience hair and teeth loss, made her look like an 80-year-old woman, brought pain to her feet, and even underwent heart surgery despite not having any heart disease.Moreover, the woman already consulted to a total of nine faith healers. Worst, some of these faith healers allegedly died as they could not defeat the culprit. After further probing and torture to the evil-doer, Nick managed to make her confess her identity. Apparently, the person who did this all was a woman named “Emily,” sister-in-law of the victim’s aunt. When asked by the faith healer why she did these, she admitted as she wailed:“Kasi maraming nagmamahal sa kanya! Hindi siya madamot, nagbibigay siya kahit kanino. Pinapakain niya ang mga tao kahit di niya kilala. Kapag may nagugutom, binibigyan niya ng pagkain. Namimigay siya ng pagkain, kahit damit niya, kahit bag niya. Lahat ng sa kanya pinamimigay niya sa taong nangangailangan! May pinagamot pa yan na babae, pinagamot niya, may sakit. Di siya nanghihinayang sap era niya kasi ang galling niya magtrabaho, matalino siya. Mahal siya ng boss niya! Kaya papatayin ko siya!”The culprit went on:“Mahal na mahal siya ng asawa niya. Inggit ako sa kanya! Inggit ako sa kanya! Papapangitin ko siya. Pinakulubot ko na mukha niya! Sobra ang inggit ko sa kanya. Sobra-sobra ang inggit ko sa kanya. Ang bait niya kasi, kahit sasabihan mo ng masama di siya nagagalit.”Furthermore, the faith healer made the evil-doer disclose that she was sent to school by none other than the victim and was even given a good job. This earned the ire of the healer and tortured her more while he said the words:“Hipag ka ng tita niya? Tapos pinag-aral ka? Oh tapos ganyan pa ang ginanti mo? Natutuwa ako sayo eh! Natutuwa ako! Ano yang ginagawa mo, ha? Pinag-aral ka na, ginanyan mo pa?”At the latter part of the healing, the woman named Emily asked for forgiveness. She said:“Patawad. Sorry, inggit ako sayo. Kasi maganda ka, mabait ka pa. Madami kang natutulungan. Kahit di mo kilala, pinapakain, tinutulungan mo…”When the victim gained her consciousness, she was unaware of what happened. She was also asked who Emily was and she aptly said that it was her aunt’s sister-in-law. She then recounted that she offered to send her to school when she saw her tending the laundry.Below are the videos of the faith healer in action:WARNING: The following clips contain scenes that some viewers may find disturbing.

That’s why the story of these young Korean students is going viral for all the right reasons. These youngsters went out of their way to help an elderly man who has lost consciousness in the middle of a cold Seoul street.Korean politician Min Byung Doo wanted to honor those who would do heroic deeds out of nothing but altruism, and so he sought the group of Korean students who, upon seeing a stranger collapse on the street, reported to the authorities at once.While waiting for respondents, the Korean students each took off their jackets and braved the cold to keep the old man warm. They figured the cold must not be doing the man well, and so they took it upon themselves to keep his temperature up. They kept him warm until respondents arrived at the scene.If most people’s kindness would end at the first sight of proper authorities, this band of Korean students went the extra mile. They waited for the old man to regain consciousness, and then accompanied him home after asking the man where he lived. They ensured that he got home safe and sound before going their way.Luckily, onlookers took pictures of the entire heartwarming gesture, prompting the Korean students to go viral. Min Byung Doo only had to ask around nearby schools to locate the boys, whom he lauded with an award of good conduct.Netizens were impressed with the level of compassion shown by these helpful students.Another netizen put the entire experience in a nutshell: “wow there’s still hope for society”Indeed, there’s always hope for the future if we only learn to help each other out.What can you say about the Korean students’ actions? If you were the elder man, how would you ever repay this act of kindness that saved your life? Do you think Min Byung Doo was right in rewarding these students?

    "body": "1855 SHARES Share TweetZiona (often misnamed in the non-native media as Ziona Chana; born 20 July 1945) is the leader of Chana páwl, a Christian sect formed in June 1942, which survives in the mountains of Mizoram state of India, sharing borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar.He is known for holding a world record as the head of the “world’s largest existing family” with 39 wives, 94 children, 14 daughters-in-law and 33 grandchildren, 180 in total and counting.The family is now living in Baktawng village, Mizoram.Ziona was featured in Ripley’s Believe It or Not! top 11 strangest stories for the year 2011, and in 2013’s Ripley Believe It or Not book 9. He is proud of and fortunate to be head of such a large family.Ziona is chief of the Christian sect known as “Chana Pawl”, which was established by his father. The sect practices polygamy. Chana sect followers claim that its origin is traced to the Bible’s Revelation Chapter 20 to “Kum Sang Rorel” or the rule of 1,000 years by Jesus Christ on Earth.The sect was originally named Khuangtuaha Pawl, after the founder Khuangtuaha. He founded it on 12 June 1942, when its disciples were removed from Hmawngkawn village by the headman of the village for propagating a theology considered “wrong and dangerous”. The sect celebrates its founding day as “Bawkte Kut” or the festival of the hut on June 12 every year. Members of the Chana sect number about 2,000 who reside in the Baktawng Tlangnuam village.Family lifeZiona hails from the village of Baktawng in central Serchhip district, which is 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the south of Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. He was born on 20 July 1945. He was married at the age of 17 to Zathiangi, his first wife, who was older than him by three years. She now controls the household activities of the family with strict discipline and is proud that everyone in the family respects her role. Ten of his wives he married in the span of one year.Ziona has built a four-storied mansion, a concrete structure, which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family. The house is called the “Chhuan That Run” or the House of the New Generation and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng. There is also a ‘khualbuk’ or a guesthouse to accommodate visitors coming to the village.Ziona has a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives take turns to sleep with him according to a roster.His younger wives stay close to his room on the same floor and there are always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them.All his wives claim to love him. His 39th wife is Madam Siamthangi who is proud to be Ziona’s wife even though he is much older than her. She is 30 years old (as of 2012) and has a five-year-old daughter by him. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they get a week to spend with him.He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He says that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembers the names of every member of his family.Ziona’s family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He does not seek any assistance from the government.Ziona’s wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture (jhum cultivation), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth.Daily family life in his house begins at 5.50 AM when all family members assemble for prayers and thereafter daily duties are assigned. Prayers and meals are held in a large hall in the mansion. Dinner is served from 4 to 6 PM in the order of age, and the day comes to a close with everyone retiring for the night by 9PM when the lights are switched off.An enormous amount of food is prepared to feed the family: 220 pounds (100 kg) of rice, 132 pounds (60 kg) of potatoes and 39 chickens.Ziona’s 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests.Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, while recording Ziona’s family as the largest living family in the world, observed: “It’s a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching 19 Kids and Counting or Sister Wives. The 66-year-old Indian man has 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren.”Ziona is interested in having more wives, even from the United States.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziona",

    "body": "Priest unwittingly takes contraband to Bohol District Jail, A priest who was about to lead a Mass inside the Bohol District Jail (BDJ) Sunday afternoon reportedly almost unwittingly smuggled contraband into the jail facility.According to BDJ administrative officer Jumbo Abad, Father James Darunday brought to the BDJ a large box of biscuits which also contained 50 packs of cigarettes and 90 pieces of packed tobacco leaves.Darunday was reportedly requested by the wife of detained drug suspect Rey Gaco, identified only as Aya, to deliver to said BDJ inmate the box of biscuits wherein the pieces of contraband were concealed.The priest told dyRD Balita that he was unaware of the box’s contents as the cigarettes and tobacco rolls were hidden beneath the biscuits.According to Darunday, he had told Aya that he will be letting jail guards inspect the box to which she reportedly replied, “OK ra na, father. Wala man nay problema.”Abad also confirmed that it was Darunday himself who asked jail guards to inspect the box while the latter proceeded to celebrate Mass.However, Darunday will no longer be leading Mass at the BDJ pending the investigation on the smuggle attempt.According to Abad, Darunday may have been used by Gaco’s wife to smuggle the contraband into the jail facility, but this failed as the priest himself asked for the thorough inspection of the box.Cigarettes and similar contraband such as tobacco leaves are considered as “nuisance contraband,” said Abad.Based on gathered reports, cigarettes are sold at much higher prices inside the BDJ compared to their regular retail value.One pack of cigarettes is reportedly sold at P600 pesos while a bunch of tobacco leaves is priced at approximately P800.Meanwhile, Abad said that BDJ officials have been implementing stringent security measures inside the facility but suspects continue to come up with different means to smuggle in contraband.BDJ officials will also be reviewing guidelines as to whether a penalty will be meted out against Gaco.[Article originally published in Bohol Chronicle, click here for full report]Commentscomments",

    "body": "Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) President Archbishop Socrates Villegas has called on lawmakers to reform the country’s criminal justice system instead of seeking to revive the death penalty.Speaking at a prayer rally in San Carlos City, the Lingayen-Dagupan archbishop called capital punishment a “lazy” proposition, and the Philippine justice system “corrupt, slow, and one-sided.”“Cleanse the police ranks! Fix all the courts! Tighten (the security) at the Bilibid and other prisons.Death penalty is a lazy form of penalty instead of helping reform those who made mistakes,” Villegas was quoted as saying by CBCP News.“We are not protesting without a solution. We are protesting with an alternative. Reform the criminal justice system,” he added.The death penalty bill at the House of Representatives passed committee-level approval by a 12-6 vote, sending it to the plenary for second and third reading.But deliberations on the measure were postponed to next year by House leaders for a “full debate.”Opposition lawmakers said the supermajority lacked the numbers.Villegas said the Church was not being soft on crime and does not take for granted the plight of victims, but noted that killing criminals is not the solution to criminality.“But the solution is not killing criminals. Our alternative is fullness of life for the guilty and the innocent. Fullness of life for the poor and the rich. Fullness of life for sinners and saints,” he said.“Christ died for the criminals and the victims. The love of God is for all. Our love should be like God’s love. For all,” Villegas added.Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle said God did not give up on sinners and “neither should we,” condemning killings as “an act of hopelessness and despair.”“Every life has hope. Every life has an opportunity to be transformed, if only we believe, if only we believe. Because the center of faith is not in the accomplishment of things. The center of faith is Jesus,” Tagle said in an Advent recollection last Sunday.“May we not give up, especially on human lives and may we not give up on every single sinner. There is hope for transformation,” he added. TVJsource : inquirerCommentscomments",

    "body": "Shocked astronomers had never seen anything like it: a bizarrely shaped rock ejected from another stellar system, just passing through ours.So strange was the discovery back in October, astronomers around the world turned their telescopes toward the cigar-shaped asteroid in the hope of uncovering its mysteries — including even listening for signs of alien life.Breakthrough Listen, one arm of an international project dedicated to searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe, started eavesdropping earlier this month using a telescope in West Virginia. But the group says it has found no evidence of artificial signals coming from the rock known as 1I/2017 U1 ‘Oumuamua, which means “messenger from afar who arrived here first” in Hawaiian.The organization says it continues to listen across other radio frequencies and analyze the collected data.Other stars, other worldsMichele Bannister of Queen’s University Belfast says the chance to study something that came from another solar system can provide scientists with crucial information to test their theory of planetary evolution.“We can do stuff here that we simply can never do in detail for other systems. And then a piece of one comes visiting!” said Bannister, the lead author of a new study about ‘Oumuamuathat wasaccepted for publication in the journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics.“We can actually connect the theory to the reality.”‘Oumuamua, which is about 400 metres long and 40 metres wide, raises many questions Bannister would love to answer.“I would like to know what its home star system looked like,” she said. “I want another one. I want to know this object isn’t unusual. Is it statistically a reasonable example of what we expect to see wandering the cosmos?”This is ‘Oumuamua, circled, as seen by the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Spain. (A. Fitzsimmons, QUB/Isaac Newton Group, La Palma.)She says with more and more telescopes dedicated to sky surveys, the chances of discovering more rocks drifting from other solar systems are increasing.“That’s something that I’m really looking forward to: the launch of the new field of interstellar asteroid research,” she said. “[‘Oumuamua is] going to have friends.”‘Weird’ rockAstronomers have discovered ‘Oumuamua resembles worlds in our outer solar system, beyond the orbit of Neptune, which helps shed some light on planetary formation.‘Oumuamua, for example, has a significant carbon content. Astronomers believe that carbon-rich material, together with cosmic ray bombardment, should colour an object like an asteroid bright red.But this didn’t happen with ‘Oumuamua.“This object has been travelling between stars for millions, perhaps billions of years, so it would have had a lot of cosmic bombardment,” Bannister said. “So [you’d expect] maybe it would be ultra-red. But it’s not.”Instead, the colour is a more neutral red, similar to what you’d find on objects in the Kuiper Belt — the outer region of our solar system, home to icy worlds — such as Pluto and its largest moon Charon.The moon Charon is seen here in a mosaic of photographs taken by the New Horizons spacecraft during its approach to the system from July 7-14, 2016. A study found that Pluto is constantly ‘spray-painting’ Charon’s poles red due to its escaping atmosphere and a reaction with solar radiation. (NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute via AP)“This object is very much similar to 15 per cent of the outer solar system,” Bannister said. “It’s a little weird, but it’s familiar.”Bannister, who worked on her post-doctoral degree at the Hertzberg Institute in Victoria, said her study wouldn’t have been possible without the work of a Canadian-led study called Colours of OSSOS, which has been mapping the objects in the outer reaches of the solar system.Another surpriseWhen ‘Oumuamua was first discovered, astronomers believed it was likely a comet. That’s because as stellar systems form, most of the objects thrown into space are comets, leftover bits made up of water and dust. Asteroids, on the other hand, are mostly rocky remnants and much less common.But as ‘Oumuamua neared the sun, the familiar tail that comets produce didn’t appear, an indication that it’s mostly rock.As ‘Oumuamua makes its way out of the solar system at roughly 38 kilometres a second, tumbling from end to end, researchers still aren’t sure exactly where it came from.“It moves like a piece of driftwood on the tide,” Bannister said. “It’s really celestial driftwood.”",

Chief dela Rosa recently visited Mandaluyong Police Station to personally talk with the rookie cops who were involved in police brutality caught on camera.In a video posted by News5 , Chief dela Rosa was seen disappointed and irritated by the improper salute of the police desk officer upon entering the station. The officer received several sermons from the cranky PNP chief.“Ayusin mo yan,” Chief dela Rosa told the desk officer while he was correcting the position of his hand.He further inspected the officer if his feet are standing 45 degrees. Chief dela Rosa then headed inside the station along with his entourage. Netizens also praised the chief for disciplining him.The viral cops he was going to confront were Police Officers Tandog and Enriquez . However, he was left disappointed as the two cops were not there. They were the cops who were allegedly caught in a video beating a civilian inside inside San Jose Barangay Hall in Mandaluyong City.The video was uploaded on Wednesday and instantly received multiple criticism from social media users. PO1 Tandog and Enriquez quickly surrendered to the authorities after their video went viral.Earlier this week, Chief dela Rosa attended the recognition rites of police trainees of Police Regional Offices 6 and 18 in Bago City, Negros Occidental . During his speech, he challenged the 821 trainees.“I want to make sure that after taking your oath as police officers of the Philippine National Police, it doesn’t mean that you’re PO1 only of Bacolod or Iloilo City Police Offices, or Regions 6 or 18, but you are PO1 of the PNP, meaning you can be assigned anywhere in the Philippine archipelago,” Chief dela Rosa said.“It should be your mindset and [you should be] willing to offer [your] life in the service of the country. Ang pinaka ayaw ko sa pulis ay yong duwag,” he added.He stressed that as police officers, they should serve the people and enforce the law. He also added that they don’t become a cop to get rich or get involved into illegal organizations.",

Nobody thought he would run for president until the very last days of COMELEC’s extension to file for COC”, Juson added.The lawyer said Trillanes dragged the name of “a respectable banking institution into an unprecedented scandal.”Duterte has confirmed on Friday that his lawyer will open his BPI account in front of the accuser (Trillanes), but the latter said he will not sign an affidavit because he is protecting is informant. /Letty Paiman/except from okd2.comCommentscomments",

    "body": "When Gordon files a complaint Senator Gordon said he’s already preparing the ethics complaint against Senator Trillanes in as early as the evening of Thursday, 31 August 2017 [As expected, the Liberal Party-led minority bloc opposed Gordon’s plans per a statement signed by Senators Aquino, de Lima, Drilon, Hontiveros, and Pangilinan [In an 01 September 2017 interview at [Trillanes and Gordon have traded barbs [Yes, I think Gordon will really file a complaint, so let’s assume that he indeed will, so what’s next?When Ethics Committee takes up complaintThe Senate Ethics committee will receive Gordon’s complaint, a hearing (or several) will be held, and the committee members will vote by simple majority on whether the complaint will be endorsed to the plenary or not.The members of the Senate Ethics Committee are:Tito Sotto (Chairman) Ping Lacson Gringo Honasan Grace Poe Manny Pacquiao Risa Hontiveros Antonio Trillanes Senator Gordon said he’s already preparing the ethics complaint against Senator Trillanes in as early as the evening of Thursday, 31 August 2017 [ Politiko ]. I expect him to file the complaint on Monday, 04 September, since 01 September is a public holiday.As expected, the Liberal Party-led minority bloc opposed Gordon’s plans per a statement signed by Senators Aquino, de Lima, Drilon, Hontiveros, and Pangilinan [ News5 ]. Nothing new there.In an 01 September 2017 interview at [ Karambola sa DWIZ ], Gordon categorically said that his ethics complaint aims not at suspending Trillanes, but from expelling him from the organization for good. I have tried searching for past incidents where the Senate expelled one of its members but I haven’t found any, so this might be a historic first for the institution.Trillanes and Gordon have traded barbs [ Politiko ] since the fateful 29 August senate hearing and Gordon is showing no signs of backing down on his threat.Yes, I think Gordon will really file a complaint, so let’s assume that he indeed will, so what’s next?The Senate Ethics committee will receive Gordon’s complaint, a hearing (or several) will be held, and the committee members will vote by simple majority on whether the complaint will be endorsed to the plenary or not.The members of the Senate Ethics Committee are:The Pro-expulsion Votes (1) Sotto Ethics committee chairman Tito Sotto is irked at Trillanes. During the same 29 August hearing, Trillanes accused him of trying to prevent witnesses from testifying, to which he irritatedly replied, “I said, 'Pag-aralan muna ng committee sapagkat hearsay.' It doesn't mean na 'huwag'. Huwag mo 'kong pagbibintangan [Sotto will probably vote against Trillanes. Ethics committee chairman Tito Sotto is irked at Trillanes. During the same 29 August hearing, Trillanes accused him of trying to prevent witnesses from testifying, to which he irritatedly replied, “I said, 'Pag-aralan muna ng committee sapagkat hearsay.' It doesn't mean na 'huwag'. Huwag mo 'kong pagbibintangan [ TP ].\"Sotto will probably vote against Trillanes.(2) LacsonLacson will probably vote against Trillanes. Lacson isn’t very fond of Trillanes either. In July 2017, Trillanes called several majority bloc senators “cowards”. In response, Lacson said, “Calling one’s own colleagues ‘cowards’ or ‘puppets’ wholesale and without qualifying, is the darndest thing he can do [ Inq ].” Lacson is also part of the Senate Justice Committee, and he’s been witness to Trillanes’ maneuverings during the senate hearing on extrajudicial killings held in October of last year.Lacson will probably vote against Trillanes.(3) Pacquiao Pacquiao, like Sotto and Lacson, is not very fond of Trillanes either. In March 2017, Trillanes sarcastically said like some of his colleagues, Lascañas did not also become a saint after his spiritual renewal. In response, the very religious Pacquiao said, “Para bang hindi ako totoong tao, para bang yung pagiging Christian ko e fake… that’s very offended (sic) to me (TRANSLATION: Like I’m a fake person, like my Christianity is fake… and that’s very offending for me.) [Pacquiao will probably vote against Trillanes.The Wishy-washy and Anti-expulsion votes Pacquiao, like Sotto and Lacson, is not very fond of Trillanes either.

[ Inq ]”Pacquiao will probably vote against Trillanes.(4) Hontiveros, and, (5) Trillanes Hontiveros and Trillanes will clearly vote against the ethics complaint, after Hontiveros previously signed a statement supporting Trillanes and Trillanes is not expected to vote against himself. Nothing surprising there.(6) Poe Poe said earlier today that the ethics complaint is unnecessary [Will Poe vote for or against the ethics complaint? Anything is possible at this moment.But with that said, let me give this short message to Senator Poe:Grace, please think hard. Being clumped with Hontiveros and Trillanes will spell an end to your budding political career. Yes, it will end your career.I put the odds at 50% in favor of the ethics complaint, 50% against.(7) Honasan The usually quiet Senator Gringo Honasan is another “wild card” because of his associations. On one hand, Trillanes was once a Honasan’s protégé. Honasan, himself a well-known coup plotter in the Cory Aquino years [On the other hand, he’s part of the three-senator Macho Bloc, the others being Lacson and Sotto, who are also members of the Senate Ethics Committee. Lacson and Sotto are likely to vote against Trillanes, and that fact can influence Honasan’s vote. Moreover, Duterte himself admitted to helping Honasan hide while the latter was still being hunted by previous governments [Does Gringo still have some sympathy left for Antonio, or will he side with his Macho peers?I put the odds at 70% in favor of the ethics complaint, 30% against.When Senate Ethics committee votes on complaint To summarize, the probability of voting IN FAVOR of the ethics complaint against Trillanes will be:1. Tito Sotto – 100%2. Ping Lacson – 100%3. Manny Pacquiao – 100%4. Gringo Honasan – 70%5. Grace Poe – 50%6. Risa Hontiveros – 0%7. Antonio Trillanes – 0% I expect Hontiveros and Trillanes to vote against the complaint. Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will vote in favor of it. Thus, it’s up to Honasan and Poe for the clincher. Note, however, that only four (4) votes are needed for the ethics complaint to prosper, so only one pro-expulsion vote is required from Honasan and Poe.That is, I think the odds of Gordon’s complaint being endorsed to the Senate plenary are pretty good.When plenary takes up ethics complaint RULE XXXIV, Section 97 of the [Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, the Senate may punish any Member for disorderly behavior and, with the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension shall not exceed sixty (60) calendar days. Note that Gordon is not seeking Trillanes’ suspension: he wants Trillanes expelled from the Senate. Based on this rule, after a majority of Senate Ethics Committee members vote in favor of Gordon’s ethics complaint, it’s time endorse the complaint to the senate plenary, i.e. the senate as a whole will vote on the ethics complaint.There are 22 active senators right now, as Senator De Lima is in detention for drug trafficking charges [Thus, two-thirds of 22 is 14.74, i.e. the ethics complaint needs affirmative votes from fifteen (15) senators.Before we go any further, let me be clear about one thing: this is Politics at work. We can choose to remain naïve by convincing ourselves about rainbows, butterflies, and unicorns, but the fact remains that in this issue – and for most political issues for that matter – political loyalties and personal political interests take primacy.Now that we got that settled, let’s move on with my predictions on voting behavior.Probable Affirmative VotesThe PDP-Laban bloc will most likely vote in favor of the complaint. The PDP Laban Bloc members are:1. Pimentel2. Ejercito3. Zubiri4. Pacquiao Note that Ejercito has already expressed support for Gordon's complaint [ MT ].The Macho Bloc members, all of whom are also members of the Ethics committee, are expected to maintain their stances, and will thus most likely vote in favor of the complaint. The Macho Bloc members are:5. Sotto6. Lacson7. Honasan The “Lone Wolves”, who are either allied to the administration or are belligerent towards the opposition, are likely to vote against Trillanes too. These are:8. Villar9. Binay10. Angara So far, we have 10 votes in favor of expelling Trillanes, so we need five (5) more, and here’s where it gets interesting.The NPC bloc may note vote as one in light of Poe’s pronouncements against the ethics case, so let’s evaluate those who are likely to vote affirmative.11. Gordon Gordon is the complainant himself. This is a no-brainer. 12. Legarda Legarda is generally pro-administration, though not as pro-administration as, say, Pacquiao or the former Senator Cayetano. With that said, however, Malacañang sources tell me that Legarda is being considered for nomination as Environment or Social Work secretary. If that’s the case, Legarda’s political interests suggest that she will likely vote in favor of the complaint. So far, we have 12 votes, so three more. Poe said earlier today that the ethics complaint is unnecessary [ Star ], which I find perplexing. You see, everybody expects Poe to run in 2019, and I find it confusing that she has to release statements that will hurt her chances of getting re-elected. But she said what she said, so let’s just assume for now that she’ll vote against the complaint.Will Poe vote for or against the ethics complaint? Anything is possible at this moment.But with that said, let me give this short message to Senator Poe:Grace, please think hard. Being clumped with Hontiveros and Trillanes will spell an end to your budding political career.

On one hand, Trillanes was once a Honasan’s protégé.

Lacson and Sotto are likely to vote against Trillanes, and that fact can influence Honasan’s vote.

Based on this rule, after a majority of Senate Ethics Committee members vote in favor of Gordon’s ethics complaint, it’s time endorse the complaint to the senate plenary, i.e. the senate as a whole will vote on the ethics complaint.There are 22 active senators right now, as Senator De Lima is in detention for drug trafficking charges [ GMA ] and is thus unable to vote, while Senator Cayetano has resigned from the Senate after accepting his nomination as Foreign Affairs secretary [ GMA ].Thus, two-thirds of 22 is 14.74, i.e. the ethics complaint needs affirmative votes from fifteen (15) senators.Before we go any further, let me be clear about one thing: this is Politics at work.

These are:\"No\" # 1. Aquino\"No\" # 2. Pangilinan\"No\" # 3. Drilon\"No\" # 4. Hontiveros De Lima also opposed the complaint but she won’t vote on it anyway because she’s currently detained in Camp Crame. Trillanes is also expected to vote against the measure.\"No\" # 5.

He publicly shared differing views on the South China Sea ruling , and he was one of the first to call for a review of Duterte’s martial law decalaration . Note, however, that he ended up backing the latter [ Inq ].Moreover, Gatchialian has a pending graft case at the Sandiganbayan [ Inq ]. Thus, it may be in his political interest to side with Duterte, since that case will probably reach the Supreme Court. By the time that case reaches the high court, Duterte would have appointed at least ten SC associate justices [ TP: SC Math ].I think Gatchalian’s odds would be just like Honasan’s in the committee level.\"Maybe\" # 4. Villanueva Joel Villanueva, while still a member of the Liberal Party, is part of the Duterte-friendly majority bloc. Villanueva is generally seen to be pro-Duterte, after photos of Villanueva's father Bro. Eddie of the Jesus is Lord movement praying over Duterte surfaced online weeks prior to the elections. That is, I believe Eddie will exert influence on Joel’s vote.I think Villanueva’s odds would be just like Honasan’s in the committee level.\"Maybe\" # 5. Recto Recto is generally cordial with Trillanes but Recto has joined the administration-friendly majority bloc several months ago [Predicting the Voting Tally Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed in the previous section. To recall, two of the 24 senators (De Lima and Cayetano) are out, so we’ll have 22 active senators in the plenary.The extremely highly probable affirmative votes are:1. Pimentel2. Ejercito3. Zubiri4. Pacquiao5. Sotto6. Lacson7. Honasan8. Villar9. Binay10. Angara11. Gordon12. Legarda The sway votes are:13. Gatchalian (70-30)14. Villanueva (70-30)15. Poe (50-50)16. Escudero (50-50)17. Recto (50-50) The extremely highly probable negative votes are:1. Drilon2. Pangilinan3. Trillanes4. Hontiveros5. Aquino The $64 Question: Backdoor Negotiations? The odds of Gordon’s ethics complaint receiving a 2/3 affirmative vote are pretty good, but it is by no means certain. Thus, it’s important for Gordon, along with other camps who want to expel Trillanes, to secure three out of the five sway votes. Thus, we are left with the following questions:Will Gordon use political capital to convince the senators?Will there be a rare display of decisiveness on the part of Poe?Will Joel Villanueva decide based on what his dad would want?Will Recto, after years of being an LP outcast, emancipate himself from the party’s clutches? And most importantly…Will the Duterte Administration influence the Senate? Your guess is as good as mine but whichever way it goes, I think that Trillanes’ immediate political survival is very seriously under threat.And here's a special message to Senator Poe: Your decision on this matter may make or break your political career, so please vote wisely. They nation's eyes are on you right now [DONT FORGET TO SHARE! Did you like this post? Help  stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Follow @iM RELATED POSTS:Recto is generally cordial with Trillanes but Recto has joined the administration-friendly majority bloc several months ago [ GMA ]. In fairness to Recto, I think he is quite neutral and fair in his decisions, so he can swing both ways (50-50).Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed in the previous section. To recall, two of the 24 senators (De Lima and Cayetano) are out, so we’ll have 22 active senators in the plenary.The extremely highly probable affirmative votes are:The sway votes are:The extremely highly probable negative votes are:The odds of Gordon’s ethics complaint receiving a 2/3 affirmative vote are pretty good, but it is by no means certain.

They nation's eyes are on you right now [ TP ].We are all familiar with Antonio Trillanes’ antics in the Senate. Looking back in history, I can recall that he has clashed with Senators Enrile, Sotto, Cayetano, Lacson, and Zubiri, to name a few. Trillanes got away with all of them, but it appears that he may not get away this time, when he insulted Senator Richard Gordon’s Blue Ribbon Committee, calling it a “comite de absuelto” during a 29 August 2017 senate hearing.This case is more important that most of us think. If Trillanes is expelled, there will only be 21 active senators left, making Comelec chair Andy Bautista's prospective impeachment trial more likely to result into a conviction, as explained in \" Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt \".I will not discuss anymore the “why” behind Senator Gordon’s prospective ethics complaint because I believe that the reader is already familiar with what kind of senator Trillanes is. Instead, I will attempt to explain the journey that Gordon’s complaint will take, along with the odds of it succeeding in expelling Trillanes from the Senate once and for all.Let’s start.",

    "body": "Lemon has a very distinct sour taste. It contains at an average 5-6 percent citric acid that is why whenever you try eating one your face will surely turn into something that is unlikely to see.Just like this baby boy named Gavin who was given a lemon by his parents. At first the child was asked by his dad if he wanted some lemons. Of course at his young age he still doesn't know what a lemon looks like and how it tastes.He trusted his parents like he was getting a treat. The lemon was given to him by his mother and he immediately bit the lemon and sipped the juice of the fruit.His next reaction was priceless. After realizing how sour the lemon was he immediately chilled because of the taste of the lemon. If only the baby could speak he would likely say that, \"Mom, Dad. I trusted you.\"His face was like a reaction you would see when someone was trying to bully you. When he was asked by his dad if he wants another lemon, he shooked his head like he was traumatized by the previous incident.",
