    "text": "General Sports IOC to decide Dec. 5 if Russia goes to 2018 Winter OlympicsFILE - In this Feb. 23, 2014 file photo taken with slow shutter speed, athletes pass the Olympic rings during the men's 50K cross-country race at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia. World Anti-Doping Agency investigations into doping haven't encouraged Russian athletes to speak out about abuses, but instead, there is a public hunt for whistleblowers, as Tuesday Nov. 14, 2017, Russia seems to move closer to a ban from the upcoming Winter Olympics.(AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky, FILE)By Graham Dunbar, Associated PressGENEVA (AP)  The International Olympic Committee will decide on Dec. 5 if Russia can compete at the Pyeongchang Winter Games.Russia faces being banned from the Feb. 9-25 games in South Korea as punishment for state-backed doping at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.The IOC said on Friday that a \"decision with regard to the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 will be taken\" by its executive board on the opening day of a Dec. 5-6 meeting in its home city of Lausanne.IOC President Thomas Bach is scheduled to announce the decision at a news conference starting at 7.30 p.m. local time (1830 GMT).Bach has criticized sport officials who call for a total ban on Russia, which could be offered sanctions that would allow some athletes to compete if they also have met stricter standards of doping controls.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it would be \"degrading\" for its athletes to take part in the Winter Games as a neutral team and be denied their national flag and anthem.That happened in August at the athletics world championships, where some Russian athletes won medals despite the Russian athletics body being suspended by the IAAF in fallout from the doping scandals.The IOC board is awaiting reports from two commissions it created to verify evidence detailed by World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren last year, weeks before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.One panel led by IOC board member Denis Oswald is prosecuting around 30 individual Russian athletes who are suspected of doping violations at Sochi. There, tainted samples were swapped with clean urine in the WADA-accredited testing laboratory.Six cross-country skiers, including two medalists, have already been disqualified by Oswald's three-man panel and banned from the Olympics for life. They plan appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.A second IOC panel is studying whether Russian state agencies, including the sports ministry and FSB security service, were involved in the doping program. That commission is chaired by Samuel Schmid, a former president of Switzerland.The case for Russia to stay in the Pyeongchang Olympics got tougher this week when WADA declined to re-accredit the reformed national anti-doping agency known as RUSADA.Russian authorities refuse to acknowledge there was a state conspiracy to corrupt the Sochi Olympics  a key condition insisted on by WADA.\"It is clear that an unconditional recognition of the McLaren Report is impossible,\" Russian IOC member Alexander Zhukov told the WADA meeting on Thursday in Seoul, South Korea.Russia blames individuals for the doping program, and wants whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov  the former director of the Moscow and Sochi labs  to be extradited from the United States. Rodchenkov is in a witness protection program after fleeing to the U.S. and alleging to American media last year how the Sochi doping system worked.",

    "text": "Football Survival specialist Pulis under pressure as West Brom slumpsFILE - In this file photo dated Monday, Dec. 26, 2016, West Brom's manager Tony Pulis gestures during the English Premier League soccer match between Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion at Emirates stadium in London. Pulis is under pressure with the team one point above the relegation zone, as the clubs fans have seemingly lost patience with their run of two wins in its last 20 league games. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, FILE)By Steve Douglas, Associated PressTony Pulis' status as one of the most respected coaches in English football is based on his reputation for being a guarantee against relegation.His record of never having been demoted in 25 years  and more than 1,000 league games  as a manager is what defines Pulis, and that's why he is suddenly under so much pressure at West Bromwich Albion.Heading into Saturday's home match against Chelsea in the Premier League, West Brom is one point above the relegation zone  in 16th place in the 20-team division  and on a run of just two wins in its last 20 league games stretching back to last season.The club's fans have seemingly lost patience with Pulis and his pragmatic style of football, and a disgruntled section has called for his departure in recent games.There are even reports of Pulis being two games from being fired, something which was put to him on Friday and wasn't dismissed.\"No, not at all,\" Pulis said when asked if it would be unfair if he lost his job. \"If the club decide what they decide, I've got great respect for the football club, the supporters, the chairman, the board  it's just life. It's the way it is. If you don't get results, you're under pressure.\"I understand, the more you give, the more people want.\"That last remark may have been a message to the club's Chinese owner, Guochuan Lai, about what he might be about to give up.It's a sign that Pulis believes he has taken the team forward since being hired in January 2015  when, incidentally, West Brom was one point above the relegation zone. He steered the team to a 13th-place finish that year, and followed that up with 14th- and 10th-place finishes in the last two seasons.West Brom's form dipped last season after reaching the 40-point mark  widely regarded as enough to be sure of staying up  and lost seven of its last eight games. After winning its opening two games this season, West Brom is without a victory in the last nine  including defeats in the last three games.Guochuan is flying in from China to watch the game against Chelsea, as he has usually done for fixtures against England's so-called \"Big 6\" at The Hawthorns since becoming majority shareholder in August 2016. That will do little to quieten the conspiracy theorists, though, especially if West Brom loses again.West Brom had a net spend of about 30 million pounds ($40 million) last summer and enriched the squad with some trumpeted arrivals like Poland midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Paris Saint-Germain, Kieran Gibbs from Arsenal, and winger Oliver Burke from Leipzig.Pulis has better players and a deeper squad at his disposal, but is failing to get the most out of them and is clearly missing Darren Fletcher, the club captain who surprisingly left in the offseason to join Stoke. Dovetail that with continued criticism of his approach  direct, unspectacular, risk-averse  and it's no surprise there are calls for change.\"People say the football's been boring,\" Pulis, on the defensive, said, \"but the last two games at The Hawthorns have seen nine goals scored.\"The problem is, five of those were scored by visiting teams. West Brom has scored nine goals in 11 games this season, with only four teams having fewer. And Pulis prides himself on having hard-to-beat teams but West Brom isn't that at the moment, even when playing an ultra-defensive central-midfield trio of Gareth Barry, Krychowiak and Jake Livermore.The 1-0 losses at Southampton and Huddersfield featured desperately disappointing displays by West Brom and its fans responded.They will abide Pulis if he gets results, by whatever means, like he did in his two spells at Stoke (2002-05, 2006-13). But he cannot even guarantee that at the moment.",

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira, file)MANCHESTER, England (AP)  Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba will return to Manchester United's squad after long-term injuries for the English Premier League match against Newcastle on Saturday, boosting the attacking options of a team that has struggled for goals in recent weeks.Ibrahimovic is making an earlier-than-expected comeback after seven months out with knee ligament damage, during which he has been released by United, replaced as the team's main striker by Romelu Lukaku, and signed again.Pogba has been out with a hamstring injury since Sept. 12 and his surges from midfield have been missed by United, whose scoring threat has reduced sharply over the last two months.Argentina defender Marcos Rojo, who has been sidelined by a knee injury for the same length of time as Ibrahimovic, is also ready to return this weekend as United attempts to keep in touch with Manchester City, which leads the league by eight points from its fierce rival.Pogba's return might be more important for the team but the 35-year-old Ibrahimovic's is more startling, given he wasn't supposed to be back until January.\"We were all saying in 2017 he would be back, but it is one thing on Dec. 31, 2017, and another thing mid-November,\" United manager Jose Mourinho said. \"Of course we welcome him back. He is an incredible personality, to fight such an important injury.\"On Pogba, Mourinho said: \"You can clearly see there is a Manchester United this season before Paul's injury and after Paul's injury.\"There are qualities in our football, qualities that influence our approach in matches, with Pogba and without Pogba. Simple as that.\"United has scored just twice in its last four league games, during which the team has dropped eight points.Ibrahimovic and Rojo seriously injured their knees in the same match, a Europa League quarterfinal against Anderlecht.United released Ibrahimovic during the summer but offered him the use of its training-ground facilities to carry out his rehabilitation after he underwent surgery.\"He made a full recovery,\" Mourinho said. \"Now you cannot expect him to be ready to play 90 minutes or to be ready to play consecutive matches like he did all his career.\"Now he needs time to be back to his level, his fitness, his confidence, his sharpness, his everything. But, from the clinical point of view, to be good and ready is fantastic.\"United signed Lukaku for 75 million pounds (then $97 million) from Everton in July as a replacement for Ibrahimovic.",

Betis won 1-0. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)MADRID (AP)  For Zinedine Zidane, the Madrid derby on Saturday is just what Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema need to break their scoring slump.The Real Madrid forwards have been struggling in the Spanish league, with just two goals between them.Ronaldo, while striking six times in the Champions League, has tallied only one in seven Liga appearances.Benzema is having an even tougher time, with just two in 12 matches across all competitions.\"It's true that this is not normal, but they just need to keep training and keep trying as they have been doing,\" Zidane says.\"You don't need to tell Karim and Cristiano that they should train more, it's something they do. They will go out on the pitch and score, I am sure of it.\"Over his career, Ronaldo has thrived against Real's crosstown rival, Atletico.Ronaldo holds the record for the Spanish capital derby with 21 goals. He scored a hat trick in his last league visit to Atletico, the final derby to be played at the former Vicente Calderon Stadium.Benzema's performances, however, have not been as impressive, with three goals in his last 14 league matches against Atletico.Zidane says Ronaldo and Benzema focused on recovering their scoring form last week during the international break, when they stayed at the club.\"We have been working on it,\" he said. \"What I want is that my players, my forwards, play well, and tomorrow is a good match for them to keep trying.\"Their scoring droughts have contributed to Real's irregular season.Real is in third place and level on points with Atletico, which is fourth after having trouble winning at its new Wanda Metropolitan Stadium.Atletico is also counting on Antoine Griezmann having a breakout. The France forward has struck just three times in 13 matches in this camapign.\"(Griezmann) is the player who can singlehandedly decide matches for us,\" Atletico coach Diego Simeone says. \"I have a good feeling ... we have yet to see the best of Griezmann.\"Both sides need a victory to keep pace with leader Barcelona, which visits Leganes hours earlier.If Barcelona wins, Real and Atletico will be staring at an 11-point gap by kickoff.",

Earnhardt is at peace with his decision to retire as he straps into the No. 88 Chevrolet for the final time in his NASCAR Cup career on Sunday. The 43-old Earnhardt has Homestead-Miami Speedway stamped as the final spot in his farewell tour. (AP Photo/Terry Renna)HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP)  Dale Earnhardt Jr. bounded out of the media center and was instantly swarmed by fans snapping photos and shoving Sharpies in his face. Earnhardt was tailed until he walked up the steps to another TV interview.\"Did you see him?\" a man yelled as more fans arrived a few steps too late to reach NASCAR's most popular driver.The chance to catch him is winding down.Earnhardt will retire Sunday, ending a career that saw him emerge from his father's intimidating shadow and grow into NASCAR's favorite son over 18 full seasons. Hilarious and heartfelt, his folksy charm endeared him to the millions that comprised \"Junior Nation \" and made him a household name to the casual fan who recognized Earnhardt simply as NASCAR's top pitchman.Earnhardt has one final destination on his farewell tour, at Homestead-Miami Speedway, a track which over the last two years also helped the sport bid farewell to NASCAR greats Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart. His legacy will be different from theirs, and not simply because Earnhardt never won a championship as they did. If anything, he was more beloved as an ambassador of the sport than any driver of his era.The 20-something Earnhardt that retreated into his motorhome to play video games all night has matured into a 43-year-old man that will be flanked Sunday by his pregnant wife, his mother and sister before he slides into the No. 88 Chevrolet one last time.\"There's a whole other world out there waiting for him,\" sister Kelley Earnhardt Miller said. \"There's his marriage and having a baby and doing other things in life, either professionally or personally that he hasn't been able to do. He'll have time for them now. It's exciting.\"Earnhardt's finale hit a bump Friday  he'll start from the rear of the field because of an engine change in the Chevys. His one wish was to end the race on his terms.\"It would be a bit of a heartbreaker if we have the kind of issue that would take us out of an event and we couldn't finish,\" he said.Earnhardt, dressed in a red T-shirt and red cap of his race sponsor, was at ease as he reflected on the end of career that started May 30, 1999, at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He finished 16th  dad was sixth  and he soon started his perpetual grip on NASCAR's most popular driver award.Earnhardt cracked jokes, quizzed his eligibility to race in an Xfinity race with a reporter and spoke with some regret on the misspent years early in his career.\"There were days when I would come into the garage to practice and everybody was in their cars pulling out of their stalls and I'm just walking in,\" he said. \"And, nothing was wrong with that, you know, in my mind. That's crazy. I mean, you'd be fired in this day and time if a driver was that carefree about it. It didn't seem to matter.\"He maintained much of that spirit even though he shaped up and ditched the lazy habits and shirttail-hanging-out wardrobe he kept at Dale Earnhardt Inc. when he joined the more buttoned-down operation at Hendrick Motorsports.Earnhardt has driven for team owner Rick Hendrick since 2008 after he split DEI, the team founded by his father but run by his stepmother. He was unhappy with the direction of DEI since his father's 2001 death in a last-lap accident at the Daytona 500, and a frosty relationship with his stepmother led him to bolt to NASCAR's most powerful team.He won a Daytona 500 with each team, and 26 races overall. But he never won a Cup championship, or came close in achievements to matching his late Hall of Fame father, Dale, who won seven titles and was known as \"The Intimidator.\"A third-generation driver, Earnhardt wanted to win a title for himself, Hendrick and the legion of fans who have idolized him for a generation. Earnhardt has been feted with charitable donations, his father's race car, a barrel of pickles and numerous video tributes from tracks, sponsors and teams. Budweiser , his sponsor at DEI, aired a tear-jerking appreciation of his days in the No. 88 car.\"They were all very emotional. Amy is the one that's obviously the most emotional, with being pregnant and everything, so they've really been hitting her,\" he said, laughing.Earnhardt, who says he's healthy and feels good in the wake of concussions that cost him 20 career races, wants some of those memories on home video and hired a photographer to shoot the final weekend and has a camera crew filming in preparation for a potential documentary.While the sport has all eyes on Earnhardt, his are on two more parting gifts: JR Motorsports can win an Xfinity Series championship on Saturday and hunting buddy Martin Truex Jr. is the favorite to win the Cup championship on Sunday.\"I'm Team Martin this weekend, for sure,\" Earnhardt said.Earnhardt's not quite ready for a complete uncoupling from NASCAR: He has two or three Xfinity races planned for next season and tossed out the Homestead finale in 2018 as a potential race.He'll still be around at the track with his Xfinity teams and his job in the NBC Sports broadcast booth. Alex Bowman takes over his ride in 2018.Outside of his family, Earnhardt will have his flock of fans pulling for him one final time in the 88.\"I thing going to Daytona next year, I'll still be coming to terms about what it looks like without Dale on the race track,\" Earnhardt Miller said. \"I'm sad about it in terms of, it's what we've known, it's what our family's done. It's all that we've lived through and worked through in our lives with losing our dad, starting JR Motorsports and all the fun and different things we got to accomplish.\"It's not over yet  but it's getting there.\"We want to enjoy this weekend,\" Earnhardt said, \"but we want to end well.\"",

    "text": "NBA MVP Ladder: Joel Embiid showing stuff of future MVP candidatePHILADELPHIA,PA - NOVEMBER 1 : Joel Embiid #21 of the Philadelphia 76ers dunks the ball against the Atlanta Hawks at Wells Fargo Center on October 25,2017 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Photo by Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images)By Sekou Smith, NBA.comBe afraid if Joel Embiid professes his love for your favorite NBA city and your team's home arena.Be very afraid.I love L.A. I love Staples Center. I wanted to come out here and put on a show, so I did, Embiid told reporters Wednesday (Thursday, PHL time) after rampaging through the Los Angeles Lakers for a career-high 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and seven blocks.That performance piggy-backed on the back of a 32-point, 16-rebound demolition of the LA Clippers Monday (Tuesday, PHL time), completing Embiids takeover of the city and reminding us all that The Process is in full effect this season.And if this is what he does to a city he loves, theres no telling what the Philadelphia 76ers big man will do if he despises your city and arena  shoutout to Hassan Whiteside. Because no one seems to enjoy the spotlight more than Embiid (just check his social media).His monster night against the Lakers continues a season-long rise for the Sixers, who are firmly entrenched in the never-too-early-to-talk-about Eastern Conference playoff chase, and cements his case for inclusion on this weeks Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Embiid is averaging 23.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.9 blocks and doing it all in just 29 minutes per game.The nimble behemoth has barged his way into the conversation with one eye-opening effort after another, minutes restriction be darned, but none more historically significant than the show he put on against the Lakers.Embiid recorded the highest scoring total by a Sixers player in 11 years as Hall of Famer Allen Iverson was the last to do it in 2006. Embiid also recorded the first 40-point, seven-assist, seven-block game since Hall of Famer and Sixers icon Julius Erving did it in 1982.Since the NBA started recording blocked shots, Embiid and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are the only players to finish a game with at least 40, 15, seven and seven, and Abdul-Jabbar did it in four overtimes. Embiid needed just 34 minutes.Sixers coach Brett Brown praised Embiids growing confidence and the growth in his game and even suggested that at least internally, they saw big things coming.We thought it was gonna be coming at Thanksgiving, he said after the win over the Lakers. Thanksgiving just happened a little bit quicker.All of it happening a bit quicker than some expected. Embiid, only 23, has played just 43 career NBA games, Saturday nights (Sunday, PHL time) visit by the Golden State Warriors will make 44.See spotlight, insert Joel Embiid.* * *The top five in the Week 5 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder:1. James Harden, Houston RocketsLast week's ranking: No. 1Season stats: 30.7 points, 10.3 assists, 4.9 reboundsHarden welcomed Chris Paul back to the lineup after 15 games away with a smashing effort -- 33 first-half points and 48 total in a smashing of the Phoenix Suns Thursday night (Friday, PHL time). Yes, you read that right: he dropped 33 in the first half against the Suns as the Rockets piled up 90 points before the break. Harden and the Rockets moved into first place in the Western Conference standings with the win and the Golden State Warriors loss in Boston. Most important, however, is the return of Paul to the mix. His return should ease some of the burden Harden has carried this season, not that he seems at all bothered by it. Rockets coach Mike DAntoni remembers how spent his star point guard was at the end of last season trying to do it all every night. He came into this season with a plan to share the workload between his star point guards. Now hell finally get to see that experiment in action.2. Kyrie Irving, Boston CelticsLast week's ranking: No. 2Season stats: 20.6 points, 5.2 assists, 3.1 reboundsTwice the Boston Celtics rallied from 17 points down to vanquish the Golden State Warriors Thursday night (Friday, PHL time), with Irving scoring 11 of the Celtics final 15 points in the game. Boston's win streak is now at 14 games and Irving is working with and without his protective mask, which means theres no doubt he has the Celtics firmly entrenched as the favorite in the Eastern Conference. He didnt come close having one of his best shooting nights against the Warriors (4-for-16 overall and 1-for-5 on three-pointers), but he rose to the magnitude of the moment against the reigning champs. Just as impressive was his leadership, as he helped second-year forward Jaylen Brown manage on a night when he had to play after the death of his best friend.3. Stephen Curry, Golden State WarriorsLast week's ranking: No. 3Season stats: 25.7 points, 6.7 assists, 4.7 reboundsCurry wont want anything to do with the footage of his foul-plagued performance Thursday night (Friday, PHL time) in Boston. It was easily his worst performance of this season (3-for-14 shooting, 2-for-9 from deep, finishing with nine points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals). The Warriors saw their seven-game win streak snapped by a Celtics team that ran its own win streak to 14 games. Curry missed Mondays (Tuesday, PHL time) win over Orlando with a thigh contusion but the Celtics had more to do with his struggles. They played an assortment of defenders on him and certainly took advantage of his foul troubles, that caused him to sit for critical stretches of the third quarter. You can bet Curry will be hunting a get back effort against the Sixers Saturday night (Sunday, PHL time) in Philadelphia.4. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksLast week's ranking: No. 4Season stats: 30.6 points, 10.0 rebounds, 4.6 assistsAntetokounmpo is finding out quickly why it will be beneficial to his game to have a point guard like Eric Bledsoe around to share the leadership burden. They havent lost since Bledsoe arrived, running off four straight wins heading into Saturdays (Sunday, PHL time) game against the Mavericks in Dallas, and Antetokounmpo has been able to exercise all of his muscles during this stretch. He had four of the Bucks 16 blocks in Wednesdays (Thursday, PHL time) Central Division showdown win over Detroit, adding that to his 21 points, six rebounds and three steals. As great as hes been as a scorer early on this season, Bledsoes presence, particularly late in games, will allow Antetokounmpo to impact games in a myriad ways going forward. If nothing else, Antetokounmpo wont always have to play the role of facilitator and best defender during crunch time.5. LeBron James, Cleveland CavaliersLast week's ranking: No. 6Season stats: 28.3 points, 8.7 assists, 7.3 reboundsThe Cavaliers have won three straight games and four of their last five with LeBron dragging his crew along as they continue to deal with their chemistry and defensive issues. His 23 points, 12 assists, nine rebounds and late-game dagger in Mondays (Tuesday, PHL time) road win over the New York Knicks was just the latest reminder that -- no matter how bleak things look for his team -- theres always a chance to turn things around when James is around. He had to perform similar heroics (31 points, eight assists, six rebounds) in Wednesdays (Thursday, PHL time) win in Charlotte, another game the could have easily gone the other way without his effort. Well see how the Cavaliers handle a little success this season today, when the LA Clippers show up at Quicken Loans Arena. But Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue doesnt have to worry about LeBron, who is grinding away to the tune of 38-plus minutes a night, being ready.* * *Next five:6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers7. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks8. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans9. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers10. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota TimberwolvesAnd five more ...DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors; Tobias Harris, Detroit Pistons; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; John Wall, Washington Wizards, Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder* * *Next up?An inside look at Eric Bledsoe from a Western Conference scout:Honestly, I havent always been the biggest fan of his game. Not there was anything about it that I didnt like, he just didnt really strike me as dynamic a player as his profile suggested he should be over the years. Even back when he was with the Clippers, I felt like there was plenty of talent to work with there, but his game never seemed to fully develop. But I have to admit, hes a perfect fit at this time for Milwaukee and I cannot say enough about [Bucks coach Jason] Kidd and what he can do for Bledsoes game and really just his understanding of the position and how he can unlock things for all those young guys on that roster.\"\"First and foremost, you out a ballhawking defender in front of all that length and defensively, it could be scary. You saw what they did to Detroit (Wednesday night). That rim protection with all that length, they can sit back and cut off all angles to the basket with the ball pressure Bledsoe provides. The real test, though, is going to be how he plays in some of those marquee matchup against the other elite point guards. We know he can put up numbers on a bad team. He did that with no problem in Phoenix. And I realize thats not an ideal situation for a guy at this stage of his career, so Im not passing judgment on how he exited that situation. But whats he going to do with the spotlight on him in some of those bigger matchups, in the playoffs? Thats the lingering question for me. Will he raise his game and the games of his teammates with his play?Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

After seeing the Boston Celtics snap his Warriors' seven-game winning streak -- and run their own win streak to a league-best 14 straight -- the All-Star guard was forced to admit the possibility that a new NBA Finals contender could be coming.\"Very, very likely, right?,\" Curry said. \"Theyre playing the best right now in the East.

Boston has accomplished this despite losing All-Star free agent signee Gordon Hayward to a broken ankle on opening night. They have also endured shorter-term injuries to Kyrie Irving (facial fracture) and Al Horford (concussion).The Celtics have risen above those challenges, enough, even, to erase a 17-point deficit to the defending champs on Thursday night (Friday, PHL time) in front of a national television audience. That, mixed with Boston's hot start, has convinced Curry that the torch out East may have been passed.",

Well, actually, it's a new on-site app that's powered by Google but it works best everytime you're in any of the Swoosh's courts with special murals.The all-new Nike HyperCourt features specialized drills straight from the Swoosh's signature athletes like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving.Using the app, players can train the way the NBA stars do without an actual coach. Your coaches are the stars. Five locations will be made available all over Metro Manila featuring a different Nike signature athlete. The LeBron James court will be Titan's Love Court in BGC, Kobe Bryant's court is the Ususan court in Taguig, Kevin Durant's court is the Comembo Covered Court in Makati, the Russell Westbrook court is the Scarlet Homes Court in Paranaque while the Kyrie Irving court is the YCL in Quezon City.It also acts as a social media platform of some sorts as players can create their own personal profile and share their progress with other players.Taking advantage of technology and addressing the fact that the young ones simply have short attention spans nowadays, the Nike HyperCourt will make sure that everyone can still raise their games on their own.\"Sobrang laki ng matutulong nito saming mga batang basketball player kasi, parang sa mga gusto talagang matuto, ito yung unang aaralin mo na drills para maging magaling ka na player,\" Kristine Cayabyab, a graduate of the Nike Rise program, said of HyperCourt.\"Makakatulong pa rin yun [kahit walang coach] kasi yung drills na yun, nandoon pa rin,\" she added.The 15-year-old basketball phenom, famous for earning LeBron James' praise during one of the King's visit to Manila, added that players can have the ability to start learning basketball the right way.In a time where most new players learn basketball by just watching on TV or on Youtube, the same way Cayabyab did when she started six years ago as a 9-year-old, HyperCourt makes everything scientific in a way.Now, Cayabyab is playing for Chiang Kai Shek College and is a rookie for Perlas Pilipinas.\"Nanonood lang din ako sa Youtube ganun, yug mga proper na gawin, shooting, footwork,\" she said.\"Sobrang laki po ng naitutulong nito [HyperCourt] sa mga players.

    "text": "NBA One Team, One Stat: Celtics get bigger, better defensivelyCHARLOTTE, NC - OCTOBER 11: Al Horford #42 of the Boston Celtics grabs possession of the ball against the Charlotte Hornets on October 11, 2017 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Brock Williams-Smith/NBAE via Getty Images)By John Schuhmann, NBA.comWhile teams with more continuity are still trying to figure out their identity, the Boston Celtics -- the team that returned only four players from last season's roster and lost one of its best players five minutes into the season -- have the best record in the league.The only games the Celtics have lost have were the game in which Gordon Hayward broke his ankle and the game they played the following night. There have been some close calls along the way (10 of their 15 games have been within five points in the last five minutes), but Boston is taking a 13-game winning streak and the league's best defense into the most anticipated game of the early season.The Golden State Warriors are bringing their own streak -- seven wins by an average of 19.8 points -- to TD Garden for the first game of Friday's (PHL time) lineup.CELTICS BASICSPace: 98.9 (22nd)OffRtg: 103.6 (19th)DefRtg: 95.8 (1st)NetRtg: +7.8 (2nd)THE STATThe Celtics are the only team that, vs. the league average, has improved in regard to each of the four factors on defense.THE CONTEXTCeltics opponents are shooting worse, getting to the line less often, turning the ball over more, and grabbing fewer offensive rebounds than they did last season. The Los Angeles Lakers can say the same, but their increase in opponent turnover rate (+0.8 turnovers per 100 possessions) is less than the league average (+1.4).On both ends of the floor, shooting is the most important thing. The Celtics' No. 1 ranking on defense starts with having the lowest opponent effective field goal percentage.And the key to that has been on the perimeter. The Celtics rank second in opponent field goal percentage from mid-range and fourth in opponent three-point percentage.On top of that, their opponents have taken only 31 percent of their shots, the sixth lowest rate in the league, from three-point range. And on top of that, only 19 percent of their opponents' three-point shots, the fifth lowest rate, have come from the corners. So not only have the Celtics defended three-pointers well, but they've done well in preventing them and preventing the more effective ones.Through Wednesday (Thursday, PHL time), the league has shot 38.6 percent on corner threes and 35.7 percent on above-the-break threes. That difference (2.9 percent) is a little less than what it's been over the past five seasons.This is the seventh straight season in which the league has taken a greater percentage of its shots from three-point range than it did the season before. The Celtics' defense is one of nine that has reduced the percentage of its opponents' shots that have come from beyond the arc from last season to this season.Of course, the Celtics ranked fifth in opponent effective field goal percentage last season, with their three-point defense being an important factor. Amazingly, if they stay there, this would be the 11th straight season that Boston has ranked in the top five in opponent three-point percentage, a stretch that began with their 2007-08 championship season.While they've seen the league's third biggest drop in opponent effective field goal percentage, it's been the other areas of defense where the Celtics have gone from below-average last season to above-average this season, with rebounding being the most remarkable turnaround.Al Horford has grabbed 24 percent of available defensive rebounds, his highest rate since his second season in the league and up from 18.3 percent last season. But the Celtics' rebounding improvement goes beyond Horford.Avery Bradley is a good rebounding guard, but the Celtics' starting shooting guard this season (Jaylen Brown) has a higher defensive rebounding percentage (17.6 percent) than Bradley did last season (16.1 percent). The same goes for Kyrie Irving (8.8 percent) and Isaiah Thomas (7.0 percent).Last season, the Celtics' starting backcourt was 5'9\" and 6'2\". This season, their starting backcourt is 6'3\" and 6'7\". At small forward, Jayson Tatum (6'8\") is bigger than Jae Crowder (6'6\"). That's a big difference in height on the perimeter and it makes a big difference in every aspect of defense, not just rebounding.This defensive improvement is coming with a 21-year-old (Brown) and a 19-year-old (Tatum) leading the team in minutes. But size has turned out to be more important than age.Bigger bodies and longer arms will obviously shrink passing lanes and create more turnovers. More important, the Celtics' added size allows them to more liberally switch screens. That has allowed them to more often keep the ball in front of them and stay out of rotation, which helps them do a better job of defending the three-point line, avoiding fouls, and rebounding.\"That's a huge thing that everybody wants to be able to do,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Tuesday. \"We've put a huge premium on it, obviously, in drafting Jaylen, Jayson and Semi [Ojeleye]. Those guys all can guard multiple positions.\"Switching is easier said than done. It requires constant communication. And no team will test the Celtics' ability to switch successfully more than the Warriors will tonight. Golden State has seen and beat every kind of defensive scheme.Golden State is also a challenge, because the Celtics' defense has been best when they've have played biggest. They've allowed a ridiculously low 84 points per 100 possessions in 131 minutes with Al Horford and Aron Baynes on the floor together. But Stevens has been willing to go with different looks to start games when the matchup has dictated it. Against Brooklyn on Tuesday (Wednesday, PHL time), Marcus Morris started and Baynes played just 12 minutes.The Celtics haven't had the toughest schedule in regard to opponent offensive strength. Thursday's (Friday, PHL time) game against Golden State will be just their fourth against a team that currently ranks in the top 10 in offensive efficiency. They've played twice as many games against the bottom 10 (six) as they have against the top 10 (three). Time will tell if the defense can remain as stout as it has been through the first four weeks of the season.\"Maybe we've just done some good things early and we'll taper off,\" Stevens said. \"And maybe we won't.\"THE VIDEOHere's an after-timeout possession from Tuesday where Brooklyn sets a double-pin-down screen for Allen Crabbe, who slips a screen for Spencer Dinwiddie.The ever-alert Horford sees Crabbe (the No. 2 three-point shooter in the league last season) break free and switches out. Brown switches onto Horford's man (Trevor Booker) but then switches again with Marcus Morris when Booker heads to the paint. Brown then switches with Irving on a Spencer Dinwiddie-Rondae Hollis-Jefferson ball screen, Tatum and Morris switch off the ball in the right corner, and Brown ultimately contests a Dinwiddie three with four seconds left on the shot clock.NBA.com/stats Video: Watch Charlotte shoot 6-for-22 from three-point range (with only one attempt from the corners) against the Celtics on Nov. 10 (Nov. 11, PHL time).TWO MORE CELTICS NOTES1. The Celtics have scored 111 points per 100 possessions in the second half of games.That ranks as the league's second-best second-half offense and is an increase from the 96 points per 100 possessions (third worst) the Celtics have scored in the first half of games.In the first half, the Celtics have scored at the rate of the third-worst offense in the league. In the second half, they've scored at the rate of the second best offense.Overall, the Celtics rank 19th offensively, having scored 5.0 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season (when they ranked eighth). Only two teams (Sacramento and Utah) have seen a bigger drop in effective field goal percentage from 2016-17 to '17-18, and no team has seen a bigger drop in the percentage of its shots that have come from three-point range (from 39.3 percent to 35.5 percent).Horford and Irving have actually shot slightly better in the first half of games. But almost every one of their teammates has shot much better in the second half.Both their three-point percentage and the percentage of shots they have taken from three-point range have been higher after halftime. They've also cut down on turnovers and gone to the line more often in the second half of games.The Celtics' defense has been good enough in the first half that they haven't fallen into many holes; They've trailed only three of their 15 games by double-digits. But their defense has also been better after halftime.Amazingly, the Celtics' third-quarter NetRtg of plus-25.0 points per 100 possessions doesn't lead the league. The team they're playing on Thursday (Friday, PHL time) has outscored its opponents by 28.2 points per 100 possessions in the third.2. Jayson Tatum has shot 19-for-35 (56 percent) on catch-and-shoot threes.That's the second-best mark among 157 players with at least 25 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts, trailing only that of J.J. Barea (20-for-32).Tatum has also shot a solid 42 percent on shots between the restricted area and the three-point line. His restricted area field goal percentage (56 percent) is below the league average, but he's made up for that by getting to the line 41 times for every 100 shots from the field. That free throw rate ranks 19th among 157 players with at least 100 field goal attempts.Tatum's effective field goal percentage of 57.9 percent ranks 25th among that same group (just a tick behind that of Stephen Curry) and is pretty remarkable for a rookie that plays on the perimeter. In fact, only one guard or small forward has shot better on at least 500 shots over his full rookie season.John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

    "text": "NBA Paul George getting comfortable with new Thunder teammatesOKLAHOMA CITY, OK - NOVEMBER 10: Paul George #13 of the Oklahoma City Thunder looks to pass against the LA Clippers on November 10, 2017 at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. (Photo by Layne Murdoch/NBAE via Getty Images)By Cliff Brunt, Associated PressOKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  Paul George couldnt find a rhythm on offense his first few weeks with the Oklahoma City Thunder.The four-time All-Star struggled to fit in with fellow All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony after he was traded from the Indiana Pacers. He settled for jumpers too often, shot too quickly at times and didnt get to the free throw line as often as usual. As he adjusted, the Thunder started the season with a 4-7 record.Once George broke out, the Thunder turned their fortunes. George erupted for 42 points in a win over the Los Angeles Clippers last Friday (last Saturday, PHL time), then scored 37 points in a victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday (Monday, PHL time). He scored just 13 points in a win over Chicago on Monday (Tuesday, PHL time), but his shots were higher quality and flowed with the offense better.The Thunder take a three-game win streak into Fridays (Saturday, PHL time) game with San Antonio.Im just staying in attack mode, playing downhill, being aggressive when I have the ball, being aggressive off the ball, George said.George leads the Thunder with 21.9 points per game. Its quite a feat to be the top scorer on a team with Westbrook, a two-time scoring champion and the reigning league MVP, and Anthony, the No. 24 scorer in NBA history. But George has that kind of talent, and he gets to play off the other two stars.Its hard because they have so many options, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. A lot of times you have the one-two option, but they have the one-two-three option. Its tough.George said during the preseason that he was adjusting to how fast Westbrook moves in transition. Now, hes in better position to attack because he is prepared. That has led to easy baskets and more free throws. He has shot 26 free throws the past three games after shooting just 27 in the previous 11 games.I think just trying to get out ahead of him as much as possible, I think, is key, George said. That way, when hes making plays in full court, Im already in position ready to receive the ball instead of catching up, getting my feet ready, trying to decide what to do. Im ready to shoot or attack at that point.Thunder coach Billy Donovan said George is starting to figure out how to use his shot selection to keep defenses guessing.I think hes just been balanced, Donovan said. Hes an elite scorer. He can do it a lot of different ways. Hes done it off the dribble, hes done it off of catch and shoot, hes done it off the drive. I think its just his balance of getting more comfortable with what were doing offensively and trying to figure out spots where he can be aggressive.Donovan said the best part of Georges performances against the Clippers and Mavericks was his efficiency  he only took 22 shots in each contest.Even when George doesnt shoot well, hes effective as both an on-ball and off-ball defender. He leads the league with 2.4 steals per game.Honestly, defense is the part that I lock in at, George said. Offensively it is going to come, defensively is where I like to leave a mark and really try to be special on that end. Its just sticking to the game plan personally in matchups, sticking to the gifts that God has given me.",

The Clippers had chances to put the Cavs away in regulation, but they didn't execute down the stretch and then had defensive breakdowns in overtime.The Cavaliers again played without starting point guard Derrick Rose, who will miss at least two more weeks with a nagging left ankle injury.The Cavs spent all night chasing the Clippers and caught them at 105-all when Love grabbed an offensive rebound and fed James, who dropped an uncontested three-pointer with 47 seconds left.Griffin missed tough shots on consecutive possessions, giving Cleveland one last chance in regulation but James missed an off-balance left-hander just before the horn.James made a free throw to open OT  he went 1-of-5 at the line  to give Cleveland its first lead. Then, after Love made his two triples, James sealed the Cavs' fifth win in six games with a jumper.Wade's aggressiveness in the second quarter helped the Cavs shake off an atrocious start. Down 10 points, Cleveland chipped away and despite some defensive lapses, the Cavs somehow tied the Clippers 56-all at halftime on James' step-back jumper over Griffin in the final second.Wade scored 17 in the quarter, 11 on free throws, as he was able to draw fouls with drives and extra-effort plays.TIP-INSClippers: Jordan made his first eight shots, three on dunks. ...

Wall wound up with only eight points on 3-for-12 shooting. The All-Star point guard's first points of the night came with about 5.5 minutes left, on a three-pointer that got Washington to 75-71.Overall, the Wizards made 38.1 percent of their field-goal attempts. Still, the hosts got within 89-88 on a pair of free throws by Otto Porter Jr. James Johnson, who finished with 20 points, made one free throw with 6.5 seconds left. That left Washington with the ball down by two, but Bradley Beal missed a 17-foot pull-up jumper and Miami rebounded, then tacked on a free throw.Beal led Washington with 26 points and 10 rebounds.The Wizards came in on a four-game winning streak, including a 102-93 victory their last time out, at Miami on Wednesday (Thursday, PHL time).Washington entered Friday averaging 110.7 points, fourth-best in the 30-team NBA, but this one was different right from the get-go.The Heat led 26-17 after the first quarter, when Washington made only 6 of 20 field-goal attempts, including 0 for 6 on 3-point tries. The high-gear, go-go attack steered by Wall was outscored 9-0 by Miami on fast breaks in that period.Wall, Beal and Porter combined to shoot 0 for 8 in that quarter. None of the three managed to score a field goal until Porter converted a pass from Wall on a fast break halfway through the second quarter.In contrast, that trio provided 65 points and 24 rebounds in Washington's victory at Miami the other night.This time, the Heat kept pouring it on for a half, pulling out to a 50-25 edge  their biggest  when Goran Dragic stole the ball from Beal and fed Dion Waiters for an easy basket with two minutes left until the break.Washington made only 12-of-42 shots  28.6 percent  in the first half, including 0-for-13 on three's.The Heat have shown themselves to be capable of stifling defense. They limited the Utah Jazz to 25 in a half a week ago, and they held the Wizards to 41  their previous season low  in the second half Wednesday.Heat: Coach Erik Spoelstra showed a quick hook, pulling F Justise Winslow just a minute into the game after the man he was guarding, Markieff Morris, scored two quick baskets. Johnson entered. ... F Kelly Olynyk was greeted with jeers from many in the crowd of 17,551 when he entered the game in the first quarter. He was involved in a scuffle with Washington F Kelly Oubre Jr. during the playoffs last season, when Olynyk played for the Boston Celtics.Wizards: Still have not defeated the same opponent in consecutive games in nearly four full years; the last time was Dec. 28-30, 2013, against the Detroit Pistons. ... After not playing at all Wednesday (Thursday, PHL time), F Mike Scott hit a buzzer-beating jumper to close the opening period Friday (Saturday, PHL time) and finished with four points in nine minutes.UP NEXT:Heat: Host the Indiana Pacers on Sunday (Monday, PHL time). Miami has won six in a row at home against Indiana, including 112-108 on Oct. 21 (Oct. 22, PHL time).Wizards: Open a three-game road trip at the Toronto Raptors on Sunday (Monday, PHL time).

Lucia6:00 p.m. -- Victoria Sports-UST vs F2 LogisticsCocolife turned to American imports Taylor Milton and Tai Manu-Olevao in the tight third set to stave off the gritty Iriga City, 25-23, 25-15, 26-24, in the 2017 Chooks to Go-Philippine Superliga Grand Prix at the Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan Thursday.The duo banged in crucial hits in the clutch to douse cold water on the torrid fightback from the Lady Oragons as the Asset Managers collected their third win in six outings.With the win, Cocolife formally barged into the top four behind unbeaten F2 Logistics, Petron (5-1) and Foton (4-1) as the tourney enters the crucial stretch of the single-round eliminations.Milton hammered 19 kills to close the match with 20 points while Manu-Olevao knocked down 16 kills, two blocks and an ace in a 19-point outing for the Asset Managers.Kay Iriga anytime na mag-relax ka tutuhugin ka eh, said Cocolife coach Kungfu Reyes. Yung third set nag-struggle kami buti na lang naka-recover.True enough, the Lady Oragons were tough nuts to crack.After pummeling Iriga City in the first two sets, the Asset Managers were comfortably ahead, 18-11, in third before the Lady Oragons gave a scary rally.Behind the hot smashes of Japanese Saama Miyagawa and Serbian Tamara Kmezic and their steady reception, Iriga City engineered a furious fightback to knot the match at 20, pushing the Asset Managers on the verge of a potential fourth set.Iriga City finally took the lead, 24-23, but Milton delivered back-to-back hits to steal the match point, 25-24.Then, Kath Villegas was assessed with an attack error, giving the victory to the Asset Managers.Kmezic finished with 13 kills and two blocks for 16 points while Miyagawa chipped in 10 markers for the Lady Oragons, who absorbed their fourth straight setback after opening the conference with an impressive win over Sta. Lucia Realty.",

Three UCLA NCAA college basketball players accused of shoplifting in China admitted to the crime and apologized before coach Steve Alford announced they were being suspended indefinitely. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump urged three suspended UCLA basketball players on Thursday to thank China's president for their freedom after they shoplifted in China.The president's suggestion came a day after he tweeted: \"Do you think the three UCLA basketball players will say thank you President Trump. They were headed for 10 years in jail.\"The trio apologized that day and publicly thanked Trump, who was in Asia last week, for his help. On Thursday morning, the president sent another tweet: \"You're welcome. go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made your release possible.\"In the same tweet, Trump said, \"HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Be careful, there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!\"Later in the day, as he rallied House Republicans before a crucial vote on a tax overhaul, Trump talked about his efforts to release the playersRep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said Trump \"personally engaged the Chinese president and it turned out the way it did,\" with the players released. He said China is known for being \"extremely punitive\" with criminal suspects, adding: \"This could have been a disaster for those families.\"Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were detained in Hangzhou for questioning last week before the Bruins beat Georgia Tech in their season-opening game in Shanghai. The rest of the team returned home Saturday.Athletic director Dan Guerrero said the shoplifting occurred when the team had 90 minutes of free time on Nov. 6 in Hangzhou. He said the three took items from three stores.The players are suspended indefinitely, and coach Steve Alford says they will have to earn their way back onto the team.",

She is only on loan to the team of Iriga as her mother league is the PVL.Palou also pointed out that the PVL All Star Game is one-day charity event held for the benefit of HERO Foundation, a foundation established to raise scholarship funds for children of soldiers who gave up their lives in the line of duty.I don't see anything wrong with what Gretchel did. In fact she should be commended for helping in this fund raising event by her participation, said Palou.He added that the All-Star event is an annual undertaking staged to benefit a charitable institution or victims of calamities.The PVL All-Star has been scheduled at the start of the 2017 PVL Season even before Soltones has been borrowed by Iriga to play for them.Citing its one-league policy, the PSL on Monday suspended the former San Sebastian star and many-time NCAA MVP for one year and fined her P50,000 for suiting up in the PVL fund-raiser.",

Kita naman natin from the first, second and third conferences na walang bitaw ang mga fans natin ng PVL, he added. We are hoping na well continue to grow it now that we are also partnering and using our barangay clinics. Sana lahat ng tao sa ibat ibang lugar mas lalo silang maengganyo sa panonood ng PVL.A new innovation was also offered to PVL fans in its inaugural year where livestream audience were given the power to choose which angle of the action they want to see with the introduction of multi-camera set up.This feature boosted the PVLs popularity that aside from tapping a broader audience base, it brought the league closer to fans through social media.Maganda na nga na sinubukan natin ang livestream kasi alam naman natin, based on our monitoring, na mas nanonood ang mga tao sa kanilang mobile phones. TV, I think, for the most part becomes the second screen eh, Laurena said.Were very happy with that turn of events also kasi siyempre nung sinubukan natin yang livestream parang kapit nga sa patalim yan eh, he added. But in the end it gave us an even bigger audience. Actually habang nagmo-mobile (viewing) sila nagso-social media na rin sila.Without revealing whats in store for the PVLs second season, Laurena vowed to give volleyball fans an even more exciting viewing experience when it opens in the first quarter of 2018.Paplanuhin pa natin yan but we want to make things more fun for the audience, he said. Im sure when we come back theres a lot that we can offer for our audience not just on TV but also on digital and hopefully also on on-ground, sa events.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

    "text": "PVL Idols, fans both enjoy every moment of All-Star SundayA male fan is relishing his selfie moment with (from left seated at the table), Ran-Ran Abdilla, Jerrili Malabanan, Creaks Racraquin, and Rex Intal.Volleyball-crazy couple Gerardo and Zenaida Reyes travelled all the way from Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, to come face-to-face with their idols in the featured meet-and-greet attraction of the much-talked about Premier Volleyball League All-Star Sunday, Oct. 29, at Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan City.The 63-year-old wife, a retired nurse, said she goes gaga over the Ateneo Lady Blue Eagles particularly middle blockers Bea de Leon and Amy Ahomiro, two of 45 PVL stars on hand that bright Sunday to interact with fans, sign autographs, and oblige selfie requests.Her husband, an engineer and six years her junior, belongs to a different breed of fans.He digs every player who is exceptionally talented, be he or she a spiker, setter or libero. Without missing a beat, he rattled off the names of Marck Espejo, Peter Torres, Ish Polvorosa, Vince Mangulabnan, Myla Pablo, Jia Morado, Grethcel Soltones, Diana Mae Carlos, Isa Molde, and many more whose court brilliancies he said takes his breath away.Guarding their positions in a long queue of PVL diehards who each would have a chance at every one of the white-shirted volleyball luminaries seated at blue cloth-covered tables joined end-to-end, Mrs. Reyes was looking forward to getting the autographs of and be photographed with de Leon and Ahomiro.Oh, Mr. Reyes was prepared to make the most of his personal encounters with his heroes and heroines, and there were 45 of them lined up for him.There were the Hashimoto sisters of GMA, Cavite  Nicole, 18, and Yuki, 9  who came with half-sister Pau Franco, 23. The two younger ones couldnt wait to see Jia Morado up close and personal.Businesswoman Cristina Fernando, 47, and a mother of four, arrived with two other companions. She was overly excited at her meet-and-greet moment with Amy Ahomiro.Pat Quiamzon, 18, and younger sibling Tin-Tin, 12, both studying in Paref Woodrose in Ayala, Alabang, came over for Bea de Leon.Who would they encounter first but handsome Tawi-Tawi pride Fauzi Ismail of National University seated beside Grethcel Soltones of PVL Open champion BaliPure?Next at the long table offering what veritably looked like mouth-watering dishes were the good-looking specimens of malehood, Ran-Ran Abdilla of Philippine Air Force and former Ateneo Eagle Rex Intal, who is now with Cignal, book-casing the beautiful pair of Jerrili Malabanan of Far Eastern University and BaliPure and Ceska Racraquin of San Beda College and Creamline.Whoever thought up these seating arrangements of the PVL standouts was a genius, not much unlike a master chef arraying his sumptuous dishes and concoctions in a not-be-outdone presentation.And so Mrs. Reyes, Mrs. Fernando, the Hashimoto sisters, the Quiamzon siblings quickly forgot their original intents of just being contented with seeing their particular volleyball idols.As quick as lightning, they had their selfies with Ismael and Soltones, then with Abdilla, Malabanan, Racraquin and Intal, besides getting their autographs.This was the second straight year that Sports Vision was staging the All-Star games. First-time All-Stars Malabanan, Racraquin, and setter Timothy Tajanlangit of the University of Santo Tomas were tremendously enjoying their share of fans adulation.We feel like we were really celebrities, said Malabanan. Oh you already are, girl, remember that.I like the feeling of interacting with fans, gushed Racraquin. Its a one-of-a-kind feeling. I make them happy and they make me happier.A quiet fellow, Gen. Santos City-born Tajanlangit, was bursting with joy at his selection as an All-Star. I will never forget this moment when fans are getting my autographs besides having selfies with me.Originally set for two hours, the autograph-signing and photo ops lasted for yet over an hour more.Each of the lucky fans went home with a memento or two of this grand spectacle that was the PVL All-Star Sunday.See you next season.",

Tapos ang mga meet and greet din na nami-meet namin ang mga taong sumusuporta sa amin. At the end of the day sobrang fulfilling siya for us.Racraquin for her part admitted that that the travel was a bit exhausting but seeing the smiles on their fans faces was all worth it.Unang-una nakakapagod. Exhausting pero super saya kasi ang dami naming napasayang tao and at the same time nakapag-travel kami as a team. Nakapag-bonding kami, she said.In other results of the Visayan PVL on Tour visit, Pocari Sweat shot down Philippine Air Force, 25-20, 25-21, 16-25, 23-25, 15-10, in Iloilo while BanKo-Perlas bested the Jet Spikers, 20-25, 25-11, 25-16, 25-17.Morado and Racraquin will go up against each other in the next PVL event set on October 29 at the FilOil Flying V Centre in San Juan.The Creamline playmaker will be donning the colors of the team that will be handled by coach Rico De Guzman against Racraquins squad under seasoned mentor Roger Gorayeb in the 2017 PVL All-Star Sunday.Helping Morado are Pocari Sweat stars Myla Pablo, Gyzelle Sy, Jeanette Panaga, Elaine Kasilag and Mel Gohing, Banko-Perlas Nicole Tiamzon and Suzanne Roces, Joy Cases of Air Force, Pau Soriano of Creamline, Isa Molde of University of the Philippines and Bea De Leon of Ateneo.On Racraquins side are BaliPures Grethcel Soltones, Jerrili Malabanan, Risa Sato, Jasmine Nabor, Aiko Urdas and Alyssa Eroa, BanKo-Perlas Amy Ahomiro, Kathy Bersola and Jem Ferrer and Diana Carlos of UP.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

Valdez had to travel by ferry to Bacolod and found a flight at 2:00 p.m. After arriving in Manila, she immediately travelled to Batangas City.In the only other game, Myla Pablo spearheaded Pocari Sweat to a 17-25, 27-25, 16-25, 26-24, 15-5 win over a Grethcel Soltones-led Bali Pure.Valdez is scheduled to play when the PVL on Tour visits Iloilo on Oct. 17 and Bacolod on Oct. 18.",

    "text": "PVL Lady Bulldogs trust new systemHappy ako na dito sa PVL nakuha namin ang sistema na gusto talaga ni coach para sa amin. Tingin ko sobrang malaking maitutulong nito for the team.National Universitys dominating championship run in the Premier Volleyball League Collegiate Conference is a testament that the Lady Bulldogs are already adapting to a new system under head coach Babes Castillo.Just a few months since assuming the post left by Roger Gorayeb last summer after the 79th Season of the UAAP, Castillo was able to slowly guide the squad under his system and bring fresh brand of play for NU.The PVL was his testing ground and the Lady Bulldogs delivered.NU swept all of its nine games in the tournament including an emphatic demolition of Far Eastern University in the best-of-three Finals series.Six-foot-5 veteran Jaja Santiago, Risa Sato, a healthier Aiko Urdas and Jorelle Singh, third year setter Jasmine Nabor and top libero Gayle Valdez responded well with Castillos system.Even with a new coach the Lady Bulldogs were able to collect their third straight Collegiate Conference title since winning the defunct V-Leagues last two editions in 2015 and 2016.Sabi nga namin, ang natutunan ko sa conference na ito is a matter of respect and mag-jive kami sa bagong sistema na ini-implement sa amin, said Santiago, who won the Conference Most Valuable Player award. Natutuwa ako kasi lahat kami sumunod doon and lahat kami nakuha namin yun.Castillo is the graduating Santiagos fourth coach in her five-year collegiate career. She was coached by Francis Vicente during her rookie year before going under the guidance of Dong Dela Cruz and Roger Gorayeb in the next three years.So adapting to a new system isn't new to her.Natutunan ko na wala namang mawawala kung susundin ko ang bagong sistema and mamahalin namin kung ano ang meron kami ngayon, she said. Happy ako na dito sa PVL nakuha namin ang sistema na gusto talaga ni coach para sa amin. Tingin ko sobrang malaking maitutulong nito for the team.The championship is a big boost for NU as the Lady Bulldogs prepare for the most important battle when the 80th UAAP tournament rolls early next year.NU has a two-year UAAP Final Four drought.Pagtatrabahuhan po talaga namin na makarating ng championship ngayong UAAP kasi yun po talaga ang goal naming, said Nabor, named Finals MVP. Kumabaga last UAAP po yun po ang plano namin pero may mga kulang pa po.Parang simula ngayon hanggang mag-UAAP na pagtatrabahuhan po namin ang mga dapat naming pagtrabahuhan para makuha po namin ang goal naming, she added.Sisiguraduhin po namin na nasa maayos kami na preparasyon, Santiago seconded.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

Hong)By Beth Harris, Associated PressLOS ANGELES (AP)  Three UCLA basketball players detained for shoplifting at three high-end stores in China publicly apologized Wednesday before coach Steve Alford announced they were being suspended indefinitely.Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley won't be allowed to suit up, practice or travel with the team while the university continues to sort out the circumstances of last week's incident in Hangzhou, China, Alford said during a news conference at Pauley Pavilion.\"These are good young men who have exercised an inexcusable lapse of judgment and now they have to live with that,\" Alford said. \"They let a lot people down in the process.\"\"I'm confident that they have already begun to use this experience as a life lesson,\" he added.Ball, Hill and Riley took turns confessing to the theft and apologizing while also thanking President Donald Trump for intervening on their behalf with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The players had returned to Los Angeles on Tuesday after Chinese authorities withdrew the charges against them.\"I'm sorry for stealing from the stores in China,\" said Ball, the younger brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, who played last season at UCLA.\"I've learned my lesson from this big mistake and I'm a hundred percent sure I'll never make a mistake like this again. It's going to make me a better person from here on out.\"When it was his turn, Hill said, \"I'm sorry for shoplifting. What I did was stupid. I don't want to be known for this dumb mistake.\"\"I hope you can forgive my stupid, childish actions,\" he added.Riley was the first to speak and he thanked the Pac-12 Conference, several UCLA administrators and his teammates.\"You guys mean so much to me,\" Riley said of his teammates. \"I'm sorry for letting you down.\"Athletic director Dan Guerrero also spoke at the news conference, but no one took questions from a large group of media.Alford didn't specify what the indefinite suspensions mean, saying only that the three players would have to earn their way back onto the team.He said at some point, the trio may be permitted to join team workouts, meetings and practices, but that timeline has yet to be decided.\"We will come to a resolution in short order,\" Guerrero said.Earlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted: \"Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!\"All three players did.\"I'd like to thank President Trump and the United States government for the help that they provided us as well,\" Ball said.The players were detained in Hangzhou for questioning following allegations of shoplifting last week before the Bruins beat Georgia Tech in their season-opening game in Shanghai. The rest of the UCLA team returned home Saturday.Guerrero said the incident occurred when the team was given 90 minutes of free time on Nov. 6 in Hangzhou.\"Those three visited several stores, took items from three stores and returned to the hotel,\" he said, without revealing the items taken or their value.The next day, Guerrero said, police arrived at the hotel shared by UCLA and Georgia Tech and interviewed both teams in an attempt to identify the culprits. Police searched the players' personal belongings and the team bus before identifying Ball, Hill and Riley, he said.No one from Georgia Tech was implicated.Guerrero said the UCLA trio was taken to a police station for questioning, and Alford arrived later, along with basketball administrator Chris Carlson. Guerrero found out while flying to Shanghai.After being arrested, the players remained in custody for questioning and were released on $2,220 bail on Nov. 8. Guerrero said they had to give up their passports and agree to travel restrictions.Upon their release, they remained in a hotel at UCLA's insistence, not the local police's, with Carlson and another administrator supervising them, Guerrero said.He said the bail money was refunded by police. Once the charges were withdrawn, the trio acknowledged breaking the law, he said.Guerrero said UCLA provided the resources to help the players and the university is working to see who is responsible for costs and any NCAA implications.Police told the players they could leave the country on Tuesday and they boarded a plane later that day.Guerrero said Alford reminded his team of the expectations for good behavior before they left on the trip and while they were in China.UCLA traveled to China as part of the Pac-12's global initiative that seeks to popularize the league's athletic programs and universities overseas. The China Game is in its third year, and while the scandal was developing the league announced that California and Yale will play in next year's edition.The No. 23 Bruins host Central Arkansas in their home opener on Wednesday night.",

    "text": "Basketball Gilas hopeful Remy Martin's dreams go beyond the basketball courtRemy Martin, then playing for Sierra Canyon School. (File photo by Gregory Payan, Associated Press)Any cager dreams of making it big in the NBA.Just ask Filipino-American point guard Remy Martin of the Arizona State University Sun Devils.But amid his success in the U.S., it's still true to Martin's nature to tap into his Pinoy roots.Aside from openly saying that he dreams of playing for Gilas Pilipinas, he's also manifesting his Pinoy upbringing through his goals.\"Being raised in that Filipino household has stuck with me and made me the person I am today,\" Martin said via Craig Morgan in an interview for thesundevils.com.\"They care for you, they show you love and they are so supportive. That's what I want to be for others,\" Martin reflects.Now currently seeking further success in the U.S., Martin hopes to inspire Filipinos to reach for the stars, while keeping their roots firmly intact.\"Every time I look at it, all I want to do is help the culture, let people know that there are Filipino basketball players that can play at this level and potentially do more,\" he said.More than basketball, however, Martin wants to give hope, empower Pinoy kids to dream bigger.\"Every time I step out on that court it's for them. It's for hope. I want to help the kids there be more motivated and see that there is another path.\"Born to Filipina Mary Ann Macaspac, Martin carved out a name for himself during his high school days at Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California by possessing a certain drive and defensive focus not usually seen from younger prospects.Now in college, Martin says he wants his defense to be his calling card. At 5'11\" his intensity on the less glamorous end of the court gives him an edge among his taller, more physically gifted peers.As he bares: \"I try to capitalize on the little things like playing defense because it's mental and it's mostly heart.\"Heart. Sounds familiar, right?That's the undying phrase embedded in the Pinoy basketball psyche as the battle cry of Gilas Pilipinas.And it's his Puso -- and defense -- that's earning him praise from head coach and former Duke Blue Devil Bobby Hurley.\"He's just got a great fire and passion and positive energy,\" Hurley said via thesundevils.com. \"He likes to demoralize the opponent if he can; just wear him down into submission just because of how hard he's willing to play on defense and then create.\"And by working hard and being himself, Martin is slowly coming close to his goal.\"Imagine being LeBron James here and having that kind of impact on kids,\" Martin said, \"It's about knowing that they have somebody where they can say 'oh, look, we have him. We have somebody that has been through this' and they can follow that.\"He reportedly wants to visit the Philippines \"within the next couple of years\" but for now, he's doing his part in inspiring the next generation of Pinoy ballers.\"Maybe I can pave the way for those kids to get some exposure. Why not? Why can't I do it? Because I'm small? OK, well, I'll be the first one then,\" he said.H/T thesundevils.com",

Hot on its heels is also 9-4 De Ocampo Memorial College; 8-5 NU Juniors B; NU Juniors A, Chiang Kai Shek, and University of Baguio, all 6-5; and 5-4 NU Seniors.Despite the loss, already into the semifinals is UP which was led by Bright Akhuetie who had 12 points.After transferring from Perpetual, the Nigerian is expected to carry State U into the Final Four in the next season of the UAAP.With an 11-2 standing to end the eliminations, UP is assured of the top-seed in the next round of the tournament. There, the top four teams will face off with the one-seed pitted against the four-seed and then the two-seed duking it out with the three-seed.In the Under-17 tournament, De La Salle Zobel (DLSZ) claimed a Finals berth after routing UST, 60-45.Jack Macasaet topped the scoring column for the Junior Archers with 11 points on top of three rebounds, two assists, two steals, and one block.The boys from Alabang will now await the winner between twice-to-beat Chiang Kai Shek and Lyceum.",

(AP Photo/File)By Beth Harris, Associated PressLOS ANGELES (AP)  Three UCLA basketball players detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting have been allowed to return home, where they may be disciplined by the school as a result of the international scandal.Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were on a plane back to Los Angeles that was due to land late Tuesday afternoon after a 12-hour flight from Shanghai.Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said the matter \"has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Chinese authorities.\"The players were detained in Hangzhou for questioning following allegations of shoplifting last week before the 23rd-ranked Bruins beat Georgia Tech in their season-opening game in Shanghai as part of the Pac-12 China game. The rest of the UCLA team returned home last Saturday.A person with knowledge of the Pac-12's decision said any discipline involving the trio would be up to UCLA. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the conference doesn't plan any sanctions.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said the school is weighing its options.\"I want to be clear that we take seriously any violations of the law,\" he said in a statement. \"In this particular case, both Athletics and the Office of Student Conduct will review this incident and guide any action with respect to the involved students. Such proceedings are confidential, which limits the specific information that can be shared.\"There was no immediate word on the trio's status for the team's home opener Wednesday night against Central Arkansas.The school said the three players, along with coach Steve Alford and athletic director Dan Guerrero, will make their first public comments about the matter at a campus news conference Wednesday, but won't take questions.Scott thanked President Donald Trump, the White House and the State Department for their efforts in resolving what he called \"the incident with authorities in Hangzhou, China.\" He indicated that UCLA made \"significant efforts\" on behalf of its athletes.It wasn't clear under what terms the players were freed to return to the U.S.\"We are all very pleased that these young men have been allowed to return home to their families and university,\" Scott said.Trump said Tuesday he had a long conversation about the three players' status with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.Ball, Hill and Riley were expected to have an immediate impact as part of UCLA's highly touted recruiting class. Instead, they are being talked about solely for their actions off the court.Ball, a guard whose brother Lonzo is a rookie for the Los Angeles Lakers, averaged 33.8 points as a high school senior. The elder Ball played one season in Westwood and left early for the NBA draft.The Balls' outspoken father, LaVar, was in China at the time of the incident. He spent some time promoting the family's Big Baller Brand of athletic shoes with his youngest son, LaMelo, while his middle son was detained.Forwards Hill and Riley, both four-star recruits, figure to bolster 7-foot senior Thomas Welsh in the frontcourt.The Bruins traveled to China as part of the Pac-12's global initiative that seeks to popularize the league's athletic programs and universities overseas. The China Game is in its third year, and while the scandal was developing the league announced that California and Yale will play in next year's edition.The game is sponsored by Alibaba Group, the Chinese commerce giant that both UCLA and Georgia Tech visited before the shoplifting incident occurred.",

As the last original owner, I am proud of how far the league has come, and the role we have played in its growth.This is the second WNBA franchise to put up for sale in the past few months. San Antonio was bought by MGM Resorts International and the team was moved to Las Vegas.That franchise will begin play next season and is coached by Bill Laimbeer, who left the Liberty last month. New York promoted assistant coach Katie Smith to the head job.While all of the eight original WNBA franchises were owned and affiliated with NBA teams, only three of the 12 teams now have NBA partners  Indiana, Phoenix and Minnesota.The Liberty is a WNBA original with a history of great players and fans, WNBA President Lisa Borders said. We thank MSG for its 21 seasons supporting the growth of womens basketball and appreciate its dedication to find a new ownership group to build on the teams successes for many seasons to come.New York has reached the playoffs in 15 of its 21 seasons but has never won the title. It has had the best record in the Eastern Conference the past three seasons. Led by Tina Charles, the Liberty were 22-12 this past year and were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.The team was fourth in attendance this season, averaging 9,889 fans, with attendance growing 8 percent over the last three seasons under team president Isiah Thomas.This was a difficult decision for us, which we made after carefully assessing the needs of our business, Dolan said. We are confident that new ownership can build on the foundation we established over these last 21 years, and steward this incredible franchise into an even more successful future.Dolan lauded Thomas for expanding sponsorships, increasing the fan base and developing a team for the long term.The Liberty now presents a tremendous opportunity for a new owner to bring new resources, creativity and focus to ensure the team becomes an enduring success, Dolan said.Dolans group also owns the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. Thomas is a former Knicks president and coach and his move to the WNBA came against a contentious backdrop of his time with the NBA club.Ten years ago, while the Knicks coach, a jury ruled Thomas sexually harassed a former team executive, and the Garden improperly fired her. A court ordered the Knicks and Dolan to pay $11.6 million, with the settlement at $11.5 million. In 2015, the WNBA and Liberty suspended Thomas bid for partial ownership of the Liberty.",

    "text": "Basketball Don't call it a comeback because Dondon never leftDondon Hontiveros will keep shooting.Don't call it a comeback because Dondon Hontiveros never actually left.Turns out, after his final stint with Alaska in the 2017 PBA Governors' Cup, the veteran sniper was still ready to go. It just so happened that the Aces didn't plan on bringing him back for another year so they gave him a tribute game to thank him for his services.Hontiveros, who had no immediate suitors from the PBA teams, just looked like he was retiring.\"Well, it wasn't really retiring. The plan was they [Alaska] gave me a tribute game and it looked na I was really retiring,\" Hontiveros told ABS-CBN Sports regarding his whole situation in the PBA and with Alaska.\"Pero I still had plans to play, but with regards to Alaska not giving me another contract, I knew na it would be my last year with them,\" he added.With the chances of him joining another PBA team for the playoffs rather slim, Hontiveros had mentioned to his agent about the possibility of making the jump to the Asean Basketball League and join Alab Pilipinas.However, there was one slight misunderstanding.A misunderstanding that cut his \"retirement\" short.\"Na-mention ko sa agent ko na to check on Alab,\" Hontiveros said.\"I was thinking na January pa yung season but when I got a call from Charlie Dy and Jimmy [Alapag], they said na November yung first game so yun nga, napabilis yung pahinga ko. Good thing, I was satying in shape the whole time so playing for Alab, parang no-brainer for me,\" he added.FULL CIRCLEAfter a decorated PBA career which included championship wins with San Miguel Beer and multiple Finals appearances with Alaska, Hontiveros is happy to come full circle with his basketball journey.He started his pro journey as the star of the Cebu Gems in the now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball League during the late 1990s where he had the chance to travel all over the Philippines to play ball.With Alab in the ABL, the 40-year-old gunner will have the chance to travel the ASEAN region to play ball.\"When Alab came up, I think it was the best decision for me, opportunity na maka-travel,\" Dondon said.\"And if you come to think of it, para I've come full circle na kasi I started playing professionally in 1998, ganito din na set up. Yung MBA nga lang around the Philippines pero here, all over Southeast Asia and China and Taipei,\" Hontiveros added.LABAN PILIPINASAnother major factor for Hontiveros to give Alab a shot is the fact that the team is the Philippine representative in a major league.Dondon cherished his time playing in the national team back when he was in the PBA and the chance to suit up with \"Pilipinas\" in front of his jersey was too hard to pass up.\"Yun din yung isang reason to play for Alab kasi yun nga, you're playing for a club team that's representing the Philippines,\" he said.\"Of course there are other teams na national team players din nila, so exciting time for me. Yun din ang pinagkaiba eh, you get to represent the country,\" Hontiveros added.Ultimately, Hontiveros feels like he can still play at a high level and thus his decision to keep shooting.Of course, him playing for Alab is also a way to give back to fans who supported his career since the beginning.\"I look forward to to show our basketball-loving fans na na-appreciate namin yung support nila,\" he said.Don't call it a comeback. Dondon Hontiveros never left.Catch Alab Pilipinas as they open their season against defending ABL champion Hong Kong Eastern on Nov. 19, Sunday LIVE at 8 p.m. on S+A, S+A HD and via livestream.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @paullintag8",

(Photo by Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images)Jordan Clarkson is one honest dude.Early in the new NBA season, the Fil-Am combo guard is enjoying some success as one of the league's better reserves, averaging 14.8 points per game through November 12.That's third-best for the Los Angeles Lakers and sixth in all of the NBA among players coming off the bench.There are two particular reasons why JC has been actively chasing success in his young pro career.The first is obvious and the second one, once you think about it for more than six seconds, is actually more obvious.\"I mean my pops, my family, thats always No. 1,\" Clarkson said, according to Tania Ganguli of the Los Angeles Times.\"But second probably the girls and stuff. Females. Know what I mean? I love women,\" he added.\"They don't like you when you're down.\"Well, can't argue with that logic.

    "text": "Milestone1977: The year Adamson won it allLet us know how you feel #1 20#1 0#1 3#1 2#1 0by Gerry PlazaIt was surely one memorable season.All of Adamson Universitys closely-knit community converging at the Rizal Coliseum on October afternoon in 1977, filling it to the rafters, anticipating what seemed an impossibility.Winning the UAAP championship.While dominant teams such as UE, FEU and UST all took the reigns in the last forty years of the league by that time, no one gave Adamson even a slim chance to break the monotony.But one brilliant point guard provided the Falcons the needed spark that made the San Marcelino-based squads dream come true.Hector Calma was just a scrappy 58 late teener who didnt even expect to make the team, given his diminutive, lean frame. But what Adamson coach Moises Urbiztondo saw in Calma was that court wizardry, leadership, and intelligence no other guard at that time could deliver.He was fast, smart, and always provided sense in any offense or defense the team played. Best of all, he directed the plays Urbiztondo laid out and saw to its symphonic execution with all his teammates knowing their roles in seeming perfect harmony.And, even with an average height of about 62 in Season 40, the Falcons stood tall and beat the giants of the league, including the Goldies, the Red Warriors, and the Tamaraws. Their strategy was choking defense on the entire stretch of the court, as Calma would even read the plays of the opponents and instigate defensive stops that would trigger a fluid transition offense.His dazzling play carried the Falcons to their romp to the 1977 Finals against another rare contender, the UP Maroons. Indeed, this playbill was so out of the norm that it ignited hysteria on both campuses, with Adamson seeking its first title ever and UP, its lone championship in about four decades.But with the sophomore Calma leading the way for the Falcons, with the able support of Randy dela Rosa, Emmanuel Apaoan, Luisito Cabiles, Nardy Macam, Jaime Rosario, Antonio Sayson, Edgardo Wycoco, Perlito Danan, Alfonso Jovero, Roberto Valerio, and Cielito Santos, they were simply too much for the Maroons.Their backbreaking defense brought UP to its knees, pulling away in the endgame with precision fastbreaks to savor its first ever, and to this day, its only UAAP seniors basketball title in front of a frenzied Adamson gallery, who had earlier celebrated the championship win of its juniors squad, the Baby Falcons. It was a double title victory that made the year identified with the Vincentian-run school in collegiate sports annals.",

UST then snatched second-place with 651.5 points while UP Pep ranked third with 610.5 points.In a parallel universe where the Iskolars ng Bayan decided to put up a fight on the cheerdance mat instead of away from it, however, what could have happened?For all of UPs historic greatness, they would have had a tall task matchingor much more, betteringthe championship routine of NU Pep last year. (Please check out this video for reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkP3OfLedxg&feature=player_embedded)That futuristic-themed performance earned for the squad from Sampaloc a score of 71150 points better than their runners-up FEU Pep Squad.Basing from how the judging goes, they aced the four categories of stunts, pyramids, tosses, and tumbling.Without a doubt, that almost-perfect tour de force was more than enough evidence for their four-peat.And so, UP Pep could have brought their best, and that still wouldnt have been enough to top NU.After all, the maroon and green had women lifting men and men being tossed up in the airand that still wasnt enough to top NU Pep in 2014.Of course, we cant be certain, but its safe to say that UP Pep could have very well brought their A-game last year only to see NU Pep playing an A-plus-plus-plus game.Still, while the new standard in the Cheerdance Competition would have gone on to win the gold, its also safe to say that State U would have gone on to win the hearts of many.Never forget that in 2014, that gender equality routine was the talk of the town despite the Bulldogs back-to-back.Also never forget that in 2016, Utak-Puso, while far from UPs best, had an iconic finish that just about everybody loved. This, even though it was NU that just won a three-peat.Bottom line, if NU and UP went at it again last year, its safe to say that NU would have won the gold, yet again, and UP would have won the hearts of many, yet again.And bottom line, we will all again get to witness NU Pep and UP Pep go at it in the 2017 Cheerdance Competition that will be on S+A, S+A HD, and sports.abs-cbn.com/livestream/cdc.",

(AP Photo/Tertius Pickard)Reigning IBF Super Flyweight world champion Jerwin 'Pretty Boy' Ancajas looks to defend his title for a third time this weekend when he takes on unbeaten Irishman Jamie Conlan at the SSE Arena in Belfast on Saturday, November 18th.The first world champion to come out of Manny Pacquiao's MP Promotions banner, Davao Del Norte's Ancajas has emerged as one of the best young boxers in the country.With just one defeat in his 28 professional fights, Ancajas is riding a 14-fight winning streak, which includes a title win over McJoe Arroyo in 2016.Earlier this year, Ancajas introduced himself to an even bigger audience after stopping Japan's Teiru Kinoshita via a seventh-round TKO in the co-main event of the Manny Pacquiao-Jeff Horn card in Brisbane.Up next for Ancajas will be 19-0 Conlan.The 31-year old Belfast native will be fighting in front of a hometown crowd as he goes for his first attempt at a world championship.An interested observer of this matchup will be ALA Boxing's Jonas Sultan, who's widely regarded as the number one contender for the IBF Super Flyweight crown after outpointing former two-division world champion John Riel Casimero at Pinoy Pride 42 in Cebu earlier this year.Should Ancajas successfully defend his crown, we could be in for a historic All-Filipino world championship matchup in the future.",

Wilder knocked out Stiverne in the first round. (AP Photo/Kevin Hagen)By Tim Dahlberg, Associated PressDeontay Wilder can't wait to get Anthony Joshua into the ring.He's just not sure when it's going to happen.\"I just want to prove who is the best, that's all I want to do,\" Wilder said Thursday. \"I want people to see a great fight and witness the two best heavyweights compete with each other one night in the ring.\"Wilder, who is coming off an impressive first-round knockout of Bermane Stiverne, said his representatives have been in contact with Joshua's camp, and the sides are exploring ways to stage the heavyweight unification fight.It could happen sometime next year, Wilder said, if Joshua's handlers aren't too protective of the British fighter.\"I think they're hesitant for a reason,\" Wilder said in a phone call with The Associated Press. \"They've got a great thing going. He can fight literally a guy who doesn't even have a name and can make millions and millions of dollars off him. Why would they risk taking a chance with the most dangerous heavyweight in the division?\"There are other obstacles to the fight, as well, including whether to hold it in England or in the U.S. and on what pay-per-view network. Joshua's camp has indicated their fighter would have to get more money than Joshua, too, because he has proven his ability to sell huge amounts of tickets in England.There's also the feeling that both fighters should fight once more  perhaps on the same night  to build up more anticipation for the bout.\"They want a warmup fight,\" Wilder said. \"Joshua's last performance was OK, but it wasn't his best. They want to redeem that and they want to make at least one more good payday before fighting me.\"Joshua fought last month, stopping Carlos Takam in the 10th round of a sloppy fight in Wales. A week later, Wilder destroyed Stiverne in Brooklyn to keep his share of the heavyweight crown.Stiverne, who lost his title to Joshua in their first fight, was criticized for being out of shape and didn't land a punch. But Wilder showed his brute power in stopping him in the first round.\"It was a devastating knockout,\" Wilder said. \"Being able to put on a spectacular performance like I did put the icing on the cake.\"Joshua is massively popular in England  his fight earlier this year with Wladimir Klitschko drew 90,000 to Wembley Stadium  but not as well known in the U.S. Wilder also is trying to grow his fan base outside his home state of Alabama and there have been questions about the quality of his opponents.But both fighters are undefeated with impressive knockout records. When they do meet it could be the biggest heavyweight fight since the days Mike Tyson was destroying everyone in front of him.\"The heavyweight division was once in a dark place but now it is coming into the light,\" Wilder said. \"It's exciting and I can't wait to make it even more exciting.\"",

He was 89.Pacheco's daughter, Tina Louise Pacheco, told The Associated Press that he died Thursday morning at his Miami home after prolonged illness.Pacheco was born in Tampa and opened a practice in Miami after earning a medical degree from the University of Miami. He met Cassius Clay, who would later become Muhammad Ali, in 1960 when the fighter began training with Angelo Dundee at the 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach.Pacheco worked as Ali's cornerman from 1962-1977, which included three successful title bouts. Pacheco has said he left his position after suggesting Ali retire because of serious injuries. Ali fought four more matches, losing three.Pacheco went on to become a television boxing analyst, as well as a painter and author.Pacheco was one of many members of Ali's colorful entourage, traveling the world with the heavyweight champion as he fought the biggest fights of his career. He got a title out of it  \"The Fight Doctor\"  but Pacheco would later say he never got a penny for his efforts.His association with Ali did pay off with a gig as a color commentator in network TV fights in the 1980s. By then Ali had been diagnosed with Parkinson's, and Pacheco told about how he tried to get Ali to stop boxing after the brutal \"Thrilla in Manila\" fight against Joe Frazier in 1975.Pacheco finally left Ali's camp in 1977 after Ali signed to fight Earnie Shavers. Pacheco would later say that he told Ali he would stick around if he fought boxers who couldn't hurt him, but Shavers was known as a vicious puncher and he feared for Ali's safety.",

(AP Photos)Whether it be in the ring or in the cage, it looks like everyone wants a piece of 'The Notorious' one.After making his professional boxing debut in a highly-hyped superfight against surefire boxing Hall of Famer Floyd 'Money' Mayweather, Conor McGregor has been a prime target for anyone and everyone looking for a money fight.The latest to call out the Irish prizefighter is another boxing legend in multi-time world champion-turned-mega promoter 'The Golden Boy' Oscar De La Hoya.In an statement he made on 'Golden Boy Radio', De La Hoya said that he'll unretire for a fight with McGregor, just like what 'Money' Mayweather did.\"I still have it in me. I've been secretly training, secretly training. I'm faster than ever and stronger than ever.\"The six-division world champion even went on to say that he can take the two-division UFC world champion down in just two rounds.\"I know I can take out Conor McGregor in two rounds. I'll come back for that fight. Two rounds.\"\"Just one more [fight]. I'm calling him out. Two rounds, that's all I need. That's all I'm going to say. You heard it on Golden Boy Radio. Two rounds, that's all I need.\" De La Hoya added.While it's hard to see this 'superfight' of sorts coming into fruition, betting odds have already surfaced, with De La Hoya opening at -140, while McGregor opening even.Opening lines for a potential boxing match between Conor McGregor and Oscar De La Hoya:De La Hoya -140McGregor EVENOdds via @BovadaLV https://t.co/pUN3DYMt89  OddsShark (@OddsShark) November 14, 2017At this point, it's unclear what De La Hoya's motives are for calling out McGregor. Does the boxing legend see McGregor as an easy, big money fight? Who knows.It's also important to note that De La Hoya wasn't the biggest fan of the Mayweather-McGregor superfight back in August.Heck, he even had some pretty strong words regarding the crossover fight. (NSFW)FUCK YOU #MayweatherVsMcGregor BOTH OF YOU ARE DISRESPECTING THE SPORT OF BOXING #CaneloGGG Sept 16th https://t.co/SX1Co1Uuj8  Oscar De La Hoya (@OscarDeLaHoya) August 25, 2017De La Hoya, 44, retired from competitive boxing back in 2008 after absorbing defeat at the hands of the one and only Manny Pacquiao. He returned to the ring back in 2016 for charity, against movie actor Mario Lopez in an exhibition bout. Even after retirement, his hands still looked, dare we say, golden.McGregor, 29, is the reigning UFC Lightweight Champion, and is one of only four people to have held UFC world championships in two weight divisions. He is also the UFC's only simultaneous world champion, having won the UFC Featherweight title and then the UFC Lightweight title. He later relinquished the featherweight championship.McGregor has not seen action inside the UFC Octagon since dominating Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight title back in November of 2016.H/T: ESPN.com",

    "text": "Boxing Wilder knocks out Stiverne in 1st roundDeontay Wilder celebrates after knocking out Bermane Stiverne in the first round of the WBC heavyweight title boxing bout Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Kevin Hagen)BARRY WILNER, AP Sports WriterNEW YORK (AP)  When Deontay Wilder finally took off the gold mask he wore into the ring, he displayed a fierce scowl.That look never disappeared from his face as he knocked out the only man who'd ever gone the distance with him.Wilder sent Bermane Stiverne to the canvas three times in the opening round to defend his WBC heavyweight title Saturday night at Barclays Center.\"So much frustration, it just seemed like my career, it's been crazy . so many guys using PEDs,\" Wilder said. \"I just want to prove that I am the best. I know I am the best, but I wanna prove I am the best.\"There wasn't much question of that in the Showtime card that ended in spectacular fashion.The 32-year-old Wilder jabbed through much of the first round while Stiverne, who hadn't fought in two years, moved slowly and cautiously around the ring. Suddenly, Wilder lashed out with a huge right that felled Stiverne (25-3-1).Already, Wilder was celebrating, but Stiverne got up. Unwisely, it turned out, because another big right as part of a flurry of punches sent the 38-year-old challenger back down.At that point, Wilder climbed atop the ropes in a neutral corner, shouting at Stiverne's trainer to end things.When they didn't, another right and then a mammoth left hook sent down the challenger for the final time with his \"Alabama Slammer.\"\"One champion, one face, one name, he goes by Deontay Wilder,\" the WBC champ said.Wilder won the belt from Stiverne in 2015 in a 12-round decision. He repeatedly insisted Stiverne would go down and out early in this one.Wilder kept his word.He is 39-0 with 38 knockouts.Wilder now can set his sights on something he has been promising throughout 2017: unifying the heavyweight belts. He wants England's Anthony Joshua, the WBA/IBF champ, sometime next year, and was busy issuing challenges after disposing of Stiverne.\"I've been waiting on that fight for a long time now,\" he said. \"I declare war upon you. Do you accept my challenge?\"I know I'm the champion, I know I'm the best. Are you up for the test?\"This was Wilder's sixth defense, and his most ferocious. Stiverne, who last fought on Nov. 14, 2015, outpointing Derric Rossy, never had a chance. He was a substitute for Jose Ortiz, who failed a drug test.Stiverne did not land a punch and never should have bothered showing up.Earlier, Sergey Lipinets won a unanimous decision over Akihiro Kondo for the vacant IBF junior welterweight title, a decision that was lustily booed by the crowd of 10,924 at Barclays Center.In a bout featuring lots of action but lots of missed punches, the 28-year-old Lipinets of Kazakhstan won despite dealing with a cut on the forehead that bled for the final six rounds. He won 118-111 on one judge's card and 117-111 on two others even though Kondo, fighting outside of his native Japan for the first time, carried much of the action in the second half of the bout.The AP scored it 115-113 for Lipinets, who is 13-0. Kondo fell to 29-7-1, losing for the first time in nine fights.\"The head butt really impaired my vision and it led to me walking into some stupid shots,\" Lipinets said.Shawn Porter pummeled Adrian Granados for most of 12 rounds in a lopsided fight. There were more clinches in the first round of that fight than in the entire Lipinets-Kondo matchup.Porter is in line for another welterweight championship opportunity; he held the IBF crown in 2013-14. He improved to 28-2-1 in a bout that had little style, but plenty of action. The judges all had it 117-111 for Porter.\"He gave me a little trouble here and there,\" said Porter, who wants a rematch with WBA champ Keith Thurman, who beat him at Barclays Center last year. \"I hurt my left hand in the sixth round, but I kept using it. I had to use my jab. It took a toll on me and by the 10th round I just couldn't throw it anymore.\"Granados is now 18-6-2.In what was billed a heavyweight eliminator, Dominic Breazeale (19-1, 17 KOs) stopped Eric Molina after eight rounds. Molina, exhausted after taking a battering in the eighth, had his arms hanging over the ropes when the round ended. A ringside doctor then stopped it.Molina (26-5) previously has lost to both Wilder and to WBA-IBF champion Anthony Joshua. Breazeale also has lost to Joshua.\"Deontay is who I want to face,\" Breazeale said.",

Currently ranked as the number two contender in the WBO's featherweight division, a win over Hayashi could establish the Boholano as the next challenger for the WBO Featherweight world championship, currently held by Oscar Valdez.Before any talk of a world title opportunity, Magsayo must first get past Hayashi, who has won 14 of his last 15 contests.Joining Magsayo on the card will 'Prince' Albert Pagara, who takes on Tanzania's Mohamed 'Chico' Kambaluta in a 10-round Junior Featherweight contest, while Jeo' Santino' Santisima faces Indonesia's Kichan 'The Lion from Borneo' Kim, also in a 10-round Junior Featherweight affair.Check out the fight card below:Fight card for #PinoyPride43 in Tagbilaran, Bohol on November 25th. pic.twitter.com/chmvj4XSBg  Santino Honasan (@honasantino) November 2, 2017Pinoy Pride 43 happens on Saturday, November 25th in Tagbilaran, Bohol.",

Parang, kung matalo ko siya, champion pa din ako.\"The odds will be stacked against Villanueva however, as he walks into Nery's hometown of Tijuana.Still, the Pinoy isn't fazed by the homecourt disadvantage.\"Talagang positive lang iniisip ko. Kaya ko manalo sa laban by win or by points, so pinag-aralan namin ni Coach yung style nung kalaban. Sa tingin ko malaki talaga yung chance.\"",

Joshua fights Carlos Takam on Saturday in a mandatory defense of his WBA and IBF heavyweight belts. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File)By Steve Douglas, Associated PressCARDIFF, Wales (AP)  Anthony Joshua was taken to the 10th round before stopping the durable Carlos Takam and retaining his WBA and IBF heavyweight titles in front of an estimated 75,000 fans in Cardiff on Saturday.The referee moved in to stop the fight after Joshua caught Takam with a hook-uppercut combination and was moving in to land more blows. The Frenchman shook his head in disgust and many in the crowd jeered the decision.At the end of an uncomfortable evening for Joshua, during which he might have broken his nose through a second-round clash of heads, the British boxer earned a 20th straight win that likely set him up for a unification fight in 2018 with either WBO champion Joseph Parker or WBC champion Deontay Wilder.Takam was fighting at 12 days' notice  as an injury replacement for Kubrat Pulev  and lived up to his reputation as a tough opponent, absorbing big shots by Joshua and making himself tough to hit with his movement. Takam took an eight count in the fourth round after toppling from a left hook by Joshua, and fought on with a cut above his right eye that twice required treatment.Joshua was taken beyond seven rounds for only the second time in his pro career. The other time was the 11-round fight against Wladimir Klitschko in April.\"I was trying to break him down round by round,\" Joshua said. \"Unfortunately, the ref stopped it. I think people want to see Takam unconscious on the floor. That was where I was trying to get to. I don't have control over the ref's decision.\"Takam (35-4-1) was cheered by the crowd after the fight at Principality Stadium, Wales' national sports arena.\"I don't know why the referee stopped the match,\" he said.Joshua was fighting at the heaviest weight of his professional career  254.8 pounds (115.6 kilograms)  and predicted a grueling slog against an experienced opponent that gets in close and works the body.Takam caught Joshua with some shots, but they didn't have enough power to hurt the champion. Still, Joshua looked frustrated at times, and even showboated in the seventh round by walking into Takam's range with his arms out and head down, then shaking his head as Takam threw a punch.",

    "text": "MMA St. Pierre wins middleweight title fight to cap night of new champsGeorges St-Pierre, of Canada, celebrates after winning a middleweight title mixed martial arts bout against England's Michael Bisping at UFC 217 early Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)DAN GELSTON, AP Sports WriterNEW YORK (AP)  Georges St. Pierre returned from a four-year layoff and peered through the river of blood that flowed down his face to choke out Michael Bisping and win the middleweight championship at UFC 217 on Saturday night.\"I took this fight to challenge myself and I am honored to be champion once again,\" he said.St. Pierre's win in the main event made it 3 for 3 for the championship challengers at Madison Square Garden in what was easily UFC's card of the year. T.J. Dillashaw won the bantamweight championship and Rose Namajunas won the strawweight title on the pay-per-view card.UFC 217 goes on the short list of one of the promotion's great cards  and a promotion at a crossroads got a vintage performance from an MMA legend in St. Pierre and a breakthrough outing from Namajunas that stamped her as the face of the women's division.The 36-year-old St. Pierre had been the UFC's 170-pound champion for nearly six years, winning 12 straight fights with nine consecutive title defenses when he walked away. St. Pierre cited the need for a mental breather before he wanted to train and fight again.Against the trash-talking Bisping, St. Pierre fought like he had only four months off, not four years. The Canadian fighter had takedowns in each of the first two rounds as the packed MSG crowd roared for the fan favorite.St. Pierre's forehead got busted open and his face turned into a crimson mask. He smothered Bisping in blood as they wrestled on the ground and stood up looking as if they had just left the set of a horror film.St. Pierre (26-2) shook it off and slapped a rear naked choke at 4:32 of the third to snuff out Bisping and win his 13th straight UFC fight.\"I don't have words in my mouth right now,\" GSP said, wiping blood from his face.St. Pierre was one of the UFC's biggest stars and pay-per-view draws during his long reign atop the 170-pound division, but the Canadian star walked away in November 2013. He's back  and ready for yet another title defense.Namajunas brought the MSG crowd to its feet with a stunning and dominant victory over undefeated Joanna Jedrzejczyk to win the 115-pound strawweight championship.Namajunas (17-3) used a devastating left that dropped Jedrzejczyk (14-1) and sent the crowd roaring in anticipation of a beatdown. Namajunas pounced on Jedrzejczyk with a series of lefts that ended the fight in the first round and perhaps signaled the arrival of a new star. She wagged her tongue and stretched her arms wide as she soaked in the magnitude of her accomplishment.Namajunas is billed as \"Thug\" and brought gasps a few years back when she shaved her long, blonde locks in favor of a close-cropped cut. She choked back tears as UFC President Dana White slapped the championship belt over her shoulder and the fans that had booed her on the way into the cage rallied behind her and drowned her out as she spoke about what the victory meant.\"Just confidence, conditioning, composure, content that I'm the champion,\" she said.The upset not only ended Namajunas' undefeated run, but she failed to tie Ronda Rousey for the UFC women's record of six straight successful title defenses.Namajunas and Jedrzejczyk posed nose-to-nose during the staredown inside the cage.\"In many ways, Joanna showed me how to be a champion but also showed me how not to behave as a champion,\" Namajunas said. \"I hope tonight changed some of her opinions about me. I have so much respect for her and for anyone who steps into the octagon and does this. I'm so happy right now. I can't wait to get home, look at my garden and take this all in.\"Where else would a woman named Rose want to go to think about how her career will grow?Moments later, Dillishaw dropped the undefeated Garbrandt with a right and finished him off in the second round to win the 135-pound championship.Dillashaw (15-3) was rocked in the first round and stumbled to his stool when he took a shot to the face to end the first. Garbrandt, predicted by many as UFC's next big star, even ducked under Dillashaw's left leg as he kicked and did a little dance to the delight of the crowd.But Dillashaw stunned Garbrandt with a high left kick to the head and then a right hook that corkscrewed Garbrandt's body and effectively ended the bout. UFC President Dana White strapped the belt around Dillashaw's waist as the new bantamweight champ.\"No Love\" Garbrandt (11-1) earned one of the loudest ovations of the night when he was shown on the screen walking into MSG. He walked out having lost his shot at taking the next step as UFC's hopeful breakout star.Dillashaw won the bantamweight title in 2014 and had two successful defenses before he lost the belt to Dominick Cruz in 2016.Paulo Costa improved to 11-0 with a second-round stoppage over Johny Hendricks and Steven \"Wonderboy\" Thompson (14-2-1) put away Jorge Masvidal (32-13) by unanimous decision for a much-needed win on the other two bouts on the main card.UFC needed this kind of night with its three biggest stars on the sideline.Conor McGregor has not announced any future fights and Rousey spent fight night posting on her social media accounts pictures and video from a video game convention in California. Jon Jones' career remains in limbo as he faces a potential four-year suspension for his latest doping violation.McGregor, who claims he wants a stake in UFC as a condition to fight, will likely come to terms and compete again, perhaps to complete the trilogy against Nate Diaz.But UFC could just about hang a \"Help Wanted\" sign on the cage door as it looks for a new wave of PPV superstars to emerge.The UFC brand carries more weight than the names on the marquee for now and UFC 217 was on pace to become the third-highest grossing sporting event in MSG history.UFC ran held four cards in New York state over the 12 months and is set to expand its East Coast footprint in 2018. UFC 220 will take place Jan. 20 at the TD Garden in Boston and a possible return to New Jersey's Prudential Center on the horizon.",

(Photo by Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images)By Dan Gelston, Associated PressNEW YORK (AP)  Kobe Bryant is set to enter the UFC octagon  at least, with a sports drink.The retired Los Angeles Lakers great is an investor with BodyArmor, the first official sports drink of UFC, and hit New York on Thursday (Friday, PHL time) to promote the partnership.He could have used something stiff to ease the sting of the Dodgers loss to Houston in the World Series.Heartbreaker, man, he said. Im happy for Houston and they deserve it. But being in LA all these years, my heart breaks for them.Bryant was flanked by UFC President Dana White and fighters Cody Garbrandt, Francis Ngannou and Cythia Calvillo just a left hook away from Madison Square Garden. Garbrandt defends the 135-pound title against T.J. Dillashaw on the UFC 218 card Saturday night (Sunday, PHL time) at the Garden.Bryant, who gave an informal backstage pep talk to the fighters, cant stick around for the card. He said he was in a rush to get home to his three daughters, the oldest of which, Gianna, has flashed some of the same basketball skills as her dad. Bryant has said he has no interest in a Lakers front office role and is content to keep his scouting reports within the family.I coach my daughters sixth grade team. Thats the extent of it all, Bryant said. Shes a beast. Shes tough. Shes a little firecracker, man.Bryant, the third-leading scorer in NBA history, called his first year of retirement lovely.I started thinking about what comes next when I was 21 years old, Bryant said. When you retire, how do you grow, how do you mature? And also, how do you understand the market?Bryant has more than business interests to keep him busy in retirement. He wrote an ode to basketball titled, Dear Basketball, that he recited in September alongside Jaws film composer John Williams and his orchestra in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Bowl. He wants to become a mentor to athletes, in the corporate world or anyone who wants to pick the brain of the five-time NBA champion.How can I take the knowledge that Ive learned in my profession and help them, Bryant asked. Ive had that in my life. Ive had guys like John Williams, who is a composer, who seemingly has nothing to do with what I do but has everything to do with it in terms of how you manage a team, how you focus on details.BodyArmour unveiled its new flavor Knockout Punch, specfically for UFC. BodyArmour says its the fastest growing sports drink in its category, and boasts 110 percent increase in sales from last year.BodyArmour wants to usher in a new generation of sports greats as the undisputed sports drink champ.Its the boxing of sports drinks. Thats what Gatorade is, BodyArmour founder Mike Repole said.Its the kind of trash talk Bryant could support. And its just a small reason why Bryant has invested in the company.I was obsessive about every little detail, Bryant said. From footwear to what I wear to recovery. If I feel like I could gain any type of advantage whatsoever, I obsessed over that detail. So yeah, this is something I wish I would have had.The Lakers will retire Bryants No. 8 and No. 24 in a ceremony Dec. 18 (Dec. 19, PHL time) during their game against Golden State. Bryant is an 18-time All-Star and the Lakers franchise leader in points (33,643), games played (1,346), 3-pointers (1,827), steals (1,944) and free throws (8,378).",

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)LAS VEGAS (AP)  Demetrious Johnson successfully defended his flyweight title for a record-breaking 11th time, stopping Ray Borg by armor submission at 3:15 of fifth round Saturday night at UFC 216.The card was the first major sporting event in Las Vegas since the mass shooting that killed 58 people this week. A moment of silence kicked off the pay-per-view portion of the event, then a handful of survivors and first responders were brought into the octagon and recognized as Everlast performed \"America the Beautiful\". The UFC has pledged to donate $1 million to help victims and their families.The 31-year-old Johnson (27-2-1) broke the defense record he shared with longtime middleweight champion Anderson Silva.\"Shout out to Las Vegas,\" Johnson said. \"Thank you so much to all the first responders.\"Borg dropped to 11-3.\"Ray Borg was running his mouth,\" Johnson said. \"I got the suplex and the armor, I knew I got it.\"Also, Tony Ferguson defeated Kevin Lee to win the UFC's interim lightweight title. Ferguson survived a slam and another takedown, secured a triangle choke, and forced Lee to tap out at 4:02 of the third round.\"Whewwww!\" Ferguson shouted after the fight. \"Feels good. This is exactly the way I wanted it to be.\"Ferguson improved to 23-3, and Lee dropped to 16-3.Johnson landed a heavy body kick in the first round and was able to gain top control, working from half-guard for most of the round while neutralizing any offense from Borg.In the second round, Borg was able to press forward and secure a short takedown before briefly taking Johnson's back. Johnson offered a quick reversal and was once again on top of Borg in dominant position.The third round found Borg looking to secure another single-leg takedown early, only to be reversed once again with Johnson on top. Johnson's ever-active smothering grappling rendered Borg ineffective for most of the first three rounds.Most of Borg's energy was spent simply trying to escape his disadvantaged position, while fighting off submission attempts. Johnson was able to mount Borg shortly toward the end of a dominating round.Borg pressed early in the fourth and took Johnson down with an impressive takedown. Johnson, true to form, wasted little time in scrambling back to top position and controlled from there for much of the remainder of the round. The final round was much of the same, with Johnson securing multiple takedowns while keeping Borg on the defense. Late in the round, Johnson secured Borg's back, executed a slam and transitioned to an armbar. Johnson locked in the submission and forced Borg to tap.Lee was able to takedown and mount Ferguson in a dominant first round.The two stood toe-to-toe for much of the second round, with neither fighter gaining a distinct advantage. Lee looked to be in control in the third round with a slam and top control. Ferguson, however, was able to stay focused from bottom position, working potential submissions until he was able to secure a triangle around Lee's neck.\"I knew I had to weather the storm and he was going to waste his energy,\" Ferguson said. \"Then I knew I'd get the submission.\"Ferguson has won 10 straight fights. He called out lightweight champion Connor McGregor in an expletive laden post-fight rant.Lee was humble in defeat.\"I have nothing but respect for this man, I'll be back,\" he said.",

(Screen grab from the FCC: Full Contact Contender YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDHQbyTS-R-EBvXALZmZpqQ)The next time someone tells you that professional wrestling is fake, show them this video.Over the weekend, English mixed martial artist Jonno Mears scored only the second win of his young MMA career, and how he did it recently became viral.After stuffing a takedown from his opponent Aaron Jones, Mears, managed to grab his opponents legs and execute an elevated Boston Crab, or more popularly known among WWE fans as the \"Walls of Jericho\", as made popular by WWE superstar Chris Jericho.Here's Jericho using it inside the WWE ring.What's even more impressive/crazy is that Mears actually got his opponent to tap out.Check it out:While it is a WWE finishing move, the Walls of Jericho puts pressure on your lower back and spine, bending it towards the opposite direction, and that definitely hurts.Jericho himself got wind of the insane win, and it looks like he liked what he saw:Good stuff.A little reminder for aspiring MMA fighters though, what Mears pulled off is likely a once-in-a-blue-moon incident, so don't go trying to win your fights by putting people in Figure Fours or trying to hit your opponents with an RKO out of nowhere.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)LOS ANGELES (AP)  The UFC has stripped its light heavyweight title from Jon Jones for a third time and reinstated Daniel Cormier as the 205-pound champion after Jones' latest failed doping test.The mixed martial arts promotion announced its decision Wednesday after the California State Athletic Commission changed the result of Jones' victory over Cormier on July 29 to a no-contest.Cormier lost the belt to Jones in a third-round stoppage at UFC 214 in Anaheim, California. Last month, USADA announced Jones had violated the UFC's doping policy with a second positive test.The California commission made its no-contest ruling after Jones' backup sample also failed a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency test for the same substance, the banned steroid Turinabol.Cormier (19-1) has never lost to any opponent except Jones (22-1), the troubled UFC star. Cormier held the light heavyweight title for most of the previous two years while Jones was largely sidelined by disciplinary issues.The 30-year-old Jones could face a four-year suspension from the California commission for his second failed test, but his representatives have indicated he is expected to appeal the result by arguing that it resulted from a contaminated nutritional supplement, a defense that has worked in previous MMA doping cases.Jones has a lengthy history of misbehavior. After avoiding serious punishment in previous incidents involving cocaine use and a drunk-driving conviction, he was stripped of his title in 2015 after his involvement in a hit-and-run accident that left a pregnant woman with a broken arm.He returned to the octagon several months later and reclaimed an interim title while Cormier was injured, but Jones' belt was stripped again in November 2016, four months after he was pulled from a rematch with Cormier at UFC 200 for failing a pre-fight doping test.Jones served a one-year suspension before returning in July, pronouncing himself wiser and more mature.",

They pour their hearts out in the octagon. But sports being sports, victory is never assured, especially in the global stage where opponents are also champions from their home soil.This is the reason why three of the top local Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighters have teamed up as they prepare to bring national pride from their respective fights in the UFC in Japan and China slated this September and November, respectively.Jenel The Demolition Man Lausa, Rolando Gab Dy Incredible Dy and CJ The Golden Boy de Tomas banded together under the guidance of Philippine Vision Group president Joe Talamayan, who helps them organize their training, conditioning, diet, coaching, as well as marketing the three athletes to get financial supporters.Lausa, an IloIlo native, who won his first fight the UFC in 2016 believes the joint, systematic training with his fellow UFC fighters would be beneficial for their individual development as athletes.Mas maganda ngayon na magkakasama kami kasi natututo kami sa isat isa. Pati ang management ng coaching, training, marketing namin ngayon, organized, he says.The son of Filipino boxing legend Rolando Navarette, Dy says getting exposed to a vast array of fighting styles and learning situations help prepare the fighters like them against the generally more well rounded international opponents. I am thankful for the recent developments in the team. We are not tied to only one gym. We can practice anywhere and with anyone as long as they welcome us, he says.De Tomas shares, Sanay ako na nagse-set ng goal sa buhay at nararating ko naman. Pero ngayon, dahil sa team, pakiramdam ko mas madali kong mararating ang mga gusto kong makamtan. De Tomas sees himself as a Dreamchiever, he sets clear goals for himself before he starts doing anything. He then pours out all his energy in working towards it until he achieves it.De Tomas started practicing Martial Arts at the age of 5. By the age of 12, he started coaching to have enough money just to go to school where he eventually became a salutatorian. At 18, De Tomas told himself he would have a championship belt and so he did, and got another belt one year later. He also told himself that by the age of 20 he would be a UFC fighter. Right now (he is 20 years old), he already is one. He stopped studying after high school. He now supports his family through sports and wants to go to college.Lausa shares, Nag-umpisa ako dati sa IloIlo, sa boxing. Mahirap, napakahirap ng pinagdaanan ko. Para lang masuportahan ko ang sarili ko, ang dami kong pinasok na trabaho --- naging janitor, waiter, at coach ako. Naging embalsamador pa nga ako! he chuckles. Di ako sumuko sa training hanggang nag-champion ako sa boxing. Pumunta ako ng Maynila para ituloy ko ang boxing pero wala akong pera. Natutulog ako sa tabi ng riles ng tren! Pinalad ulit ako nung pumasok ako ng MMA at naging champion ako sa URCC. Pero lahat ito, naging napakahirap. Laking pasasalamat ko sa mga tumulong sa akin dati, at hanggang ngayon, lalo na kay Sir Joe. Mahirap ang buhay ng isang fighter. Masarap isipin na bukod sa suporta ng pamilya ko, meron pa akong team na parang pamilya na din, Lausa says.I am so motivated in my next fight! I know Im a winner, says Dy. I will show the world what being Incredible means! Ive been down so many times in my life and that taught me how to survive against anything and win against anything. I feel powerful, I feel healthy. I am ready! I worked so hard for this! he adds. A dog-lover, he reflects the personality of his favorite pet and ally, a pitbull. Confident, strong, outspoken but has a soft spot for his close friends and family.I feel for the fighters, says Talamayan, who leads in managing the athletes. They put their heart and soul in the sport. They practice morning, day and night, to excel in their craft. They rely on fighting as their means of living, to bring their kids to school and feed their families. They work harder than most of us! Building a team that can support them in what they do is the least that we can do, he says. Please support them on their fights. Follow them on social media and give a few words of encouragement, or just say hello. Go Philippines! Lets unite, and win! he adds.Uniting the fighters as one can bring good things for the fighters and, in a larger scale, for the Filipino brand in the UFC. Filipinos love to root for fellow Filipinos. Winning the three fights is the perfect situation to bring back national pride once again in the UFC, Talamayan says.Please support us. Sana makanood kayo ng mga laban namin. Laban natin ito. Mas masarap lumaban kapag kasama ang buong bayan! Lausa says.Dy will clash with Japanese Teruto Ishihara on September 23 at the UFC Fight Night 117 at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. De Tomas is awaiting an opponent and will compete in the first ever UFC Fight Night in Shanghai, China on November 25. Lausa is in the middle of finalizing his fight plans in the UFC in the coming months.",

Rousey was on fire in the start of her career, winning her first twelve professional fights and establishing herself as one of the most dominant champions in MMA history.Her momentum came to a screeching halt however when she ran into Holly Holm, losing via knockout in 2015, before suffering the same fate against Nunes.While Rousey has not yet officially retired, many believe that the former UFC bantamweight queen is done with her MMA career.Congratulations to Ronda Rousey and Travis Browne!",

(AP Photo/Isaac Brekken)By Greg Beacham, Associated PressLAS VEGAS (AP)  Conor McGregor was exhausted and hurt by the 10th round, his audacious venture undone by every logical problem with a mixed martial artist entering a professional boxing ring for the first time to take on the most accomplished boxer of recent years.Yet the Irishman lasted longer and fought more competitively against Floyd Mayweather Jr. than just about anyone expected. McGregor was gracious and analytical afterward, but he was bothered by one aspect of his defeat: Referee Robert Byrd's seemingly wise decision to stop the bout while McGregor was still on his wobbly legs.\"Let the man put me down,\" he said.Among his many talents, McGregor has a knack for coming up with slogans that would look good both on a T-shirt and a coat of arms.Even though he didn't get his wish to taste the canvas, McGregor left the Vegas ring with his honor intact  and he can go just about anywhere he wants from here.\"I'll see what's next, but I'm open,\" McGregor said. \"I love a good fight, and tonight was a damn good fight. I can't tell you exactly what's next, but something will be next.\"After hanging in there against Mayweather, McGregor is in an unprecedented position as a huge draw in two combat sports. He could command another hefty boxing paycheck, or he could return to the UFC to defend his two championship belts as the biggest star in his up-and-coming sport.McGregor will make no decisions before his upcoming yachting holiday in Ibiza, but he certainly doesn't seem eager to limit himself to one sport.\"I believe I'll do it again,\" McGregor said of boxing, before immediately adding: \"I'm looking forward to kicking something again. I'm also looking forward to grappling. I'm looking forward to getting back in and having a good, solid knock again.\"The UFC wants its biggest star back in the octagon quickly. McGregor has won titles in two weight classes, but he has never defended either belt, and he hasn't fought at all since last November.Yet the UFC also just made untold millions from McGregor's dalliance with boxing while he was under contract. President Dana White realizes McGregor will be impressed by boxing money, and White says he is willing to write a check that will keep McGregor in the cage.\"I would rather he did not (box again),\" White said. \"This is not what he does. He is a mixed martial artist.\"A third meeting with Nate Diaz is an obvious choice for McGregor's next UFC fight after their two crowd-pleasing brawls in 2016. McGregor immediately mentioned that possibility, but also said he would want that bout at the lightweight limit of 155 pounds, not the 170-pound welterweight mark at which they fought the first two times.\"I'm the 155-pound champion,\" said McGregor, who weighed in for Mayweather at 153 pounds. \"If he wants that fight, he must come down. That's a fair trade.\"Other possible UFC opponents include the winner of the interim lightweight title fight between Tony Ferguson and Kevin Lee in October. McGregor also has said he would like to fight No. 1 lightweight contender Khabib Nurmagomedov in a major UFC event in Russia.Returning to featherweight is less likely, given the effort necessary to make that 145-pound limit. McGregor hasn't fought there since he knocked out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds in late 2015, and the vaunted Max Holloway recently won that belt.If McGregor wants boxing-size paychecks, a fight with his retired sparring partner, Paulie Malignaggi, seems logical. Other 154-pound boxers would line up for a chance to prove that Mayweather was washed up by clobbering McGregor.But McGregor's capable performance will have consequences rippling beyond his own wealth: He likely opened opportunities for other mixed martial artists to cross into boxing, if the UFC and boxing promoters can make profitable deals. UFC bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt is among the MMA fighters who grew up in boxing gyms and would love to pursue a career in both sports.No matter what he decides, McGregor established himself as a major sports icon with his valiant defeat and world-class trash-talking. He intends to cash in on that success in his limitless future.\"I'm young, I'm fit and I'm fresh,\" McGregor said. \"I'll continue to get better, and I'll continue to make adjustments that I learned from this fight to make myself a better fighter. I always have, and I always will.\"",

McGregor is scheduled to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a boxing match in Las Vegas on Aug. 26. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)By Greg Beacham, Associated PressLAS VEGAS (AP)  Tony Ferguson and Kevin Lee don't consider it a betrayal of their profession to say Conor McGregor will probably lose his boxing match with Floyd Mayweather.\"I've got to be honest,\" said Ferguson, the UFC's No. 2-ranked lightweight. \"It's going to go past four rounds, but it's going to be Mayweather.\"Ferguson and Lee will fight for the UFC's interim lightweight belt in Las Vegas in six weeks, but they'll both spend this weekend in the same arena watching McGregor, who holds the UFC's regular lightweight title. The contenders both respect McGregor's abilities, but they also understand the scope of the task he's facing Saturday night.\"I don't see it,\" Lee said. \"That's a big hill to climb. You're talking about 20 years of experience against six weeks of boxing training? You can't do much with that.\"Ferguson and Lee share the viewpoint held by most UFC fighters heading into the boxing spectacle of the summer: While they don't think McGregor will win, they hope a reputable performance by the Irishman will raise their sport's credibility and exposure while opening up new financial opportunities to anybody with a stiff punch.Even if McGregor gets embarrassed, UFC flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson will respect him for trying.\"He's about to make about $100 million,\" Johnson said. \"While (fans) spend the rest of their days doubting him, he'll spend the rest of his days eating lobster. Why not go for it? He's going to make the most money he's ever going to make. He's representing our sport and himself, and showing that mixed martial artists, we have the skills to hang with the best.\"The fighters feel that a lopsided loss might belittle MMA slightly among casual fight fans, but it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody who understands both sports. In fact, Lee thinks McGregor would be more damaged than MMA.\"It's going to hurt this,\" Lee said while pointing at his head. \"It's going to hurt his confidence more than anything. He's messing with these Michigan boys now. He's messing with Floyd, and after that he's got to mess with me. He's going to have some millions to fall back on, but it's going to hurt him.\"If McGregor hadn't talked his way into this improbable boxing match, his next opponent easily could have been Ferguson (22-3), the gritty lightweight contender. Ferguson is overdue for a title shot, but the division has been frozen since McGregor beat Eddie Alvarez late last year to claim his second belt.Ferguson already had a bout wiped out earlier this year when No. 1 contender Khabib Nurmagomedov couldn't fight. He has grown weary of waiting for the chance to move up, and McGregor's dalliance with boxing has delayed him even more.\"Defend or vacate,\" Ferguson said, addressing McGregor. \"This is where we're at. The (lightweight) belt belongs in the UFC. It's not a boxing belt. You need to come back. You need to defend, or you need to vacate. You're out there making money, that's fine, that's perfect. But I like to fight. I like to compete. You said the same thing. So when you're sitting on the sidelines, you should come back and get in the octagon and compete with me, or you need to move on.\"Ferguson and Lee also wouldn't be surprised if McGregor never returns to the octagon.\"What would he be coming back for?\" Lee said. \"I think he should retire. He's already a champion. He's already got enough money.\"While most MMA fighters realize the unique alchemy of this particular matchup, they would love it if crossover fights became a thing. McGregor and UFC President Dana White both believe the Money Fight will lead to more boxing opportunities for MMA stars.\"I think it's a win-win for combat sports,\" White said. \"I always like when these types of fights come together, and you can see where the bar is on what's possible.\"Johnson has reigned atop the flyweight division for five years, but his low-profile weight class  and maybe the UFC's marketing efforts around him  have limited his ability to earn top dollar.If the opportunity to box a top 125-pounder ever arose, Johnson would have to consider the possibility.\"For me, it's about the maximum compensation,\" Johnson said. \"Can I capitalize on the money? If someone says, 'Hey, dude, why don't you come fight in boxing? We're going to pay you $5 million.' I'm going to take that whether I get knocked out or not. I'll fight to the best of my ability, because I'll tell you what, it'll take a long time for me to make $5 million here (in the UFC).\"Ferguson is an impressive striker with a mean streak and a growing affinity for the bombast of fight promotion. He would entertain a boxing match as well.\"I don't have to worry about getting kicked or kneed or taken down?\" Ferguson asked with a grin. \"All I've got to worry about is your hands and my footwork? Sign me up for that.\"This special is available to subscribers of ONE SKY, SKYcable, Destiny Cable, SKYdirect, and SKYbroadband via SKY On Demand for P950.Existing subscribers can catch the fight by calling 4180000 or their local SKY office, texting BOXINGPPV to 23662 or by visiting www.mysky.com.ph/boxingppv.SKYdirect postpaid subscribers can text SKY to 23668; SKYdirect prepaid users can also subscribe through mysky.com.ph/boxingppvSports fans are encouraged to watch out for announcements as SKY Sports PPV will continue to offer more live sporting events.",

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)By Greg Beacham, Associated PressLAS VEGAS (AP)  Conor McGregor has already won.Even if the loquacious Irishman takes the one-sided beating that most expect him to receive from Floyd Mayweather in the boxing spectacle of the summer, the UFC champion has earned life-changing wealth simply by getting into the Vegas ring. Getting knocked out wouldn't change that the most famous man in mixed martial arts would still have an unprecedented perch as a powerful player in two combat sports.UFC President Dana White puts it succinctly: \"Conor can do whatever Conor wants to do with his life after this. Everything is possible. He's the unicorn.\"McGregor seems constantly mindful of the enormity of what he has achieved simply by making this showdown happen, and it fills him with glee. With no competitive boxing experience since adolescence, McGregor managed to talk his way into a pay-per-view fight with Mayweather, the unbeaten champion in the final bout of a perfect 21-year career.A fight that started as a barstool argument and turned into a social media phenomenon has improbably evolved into a real, actual sporting event that will create untold millions in wealth, much of it going into the fighters' pockets. There's no telling just how much it will be yet, but McGregor is widely expected to make between $75 million and $150 million, depending on pay-per-view sales.\"It's absolutely amazing to be involved in it,\" said McGregor, whose cocky public veneer often gets lowered in private. \"I'm very grateful. The city of Las Vegas is going to benefit massively from it, as is (Mayweather). Everyone involved, we're all living good. Life is so good, and I'm grateful.\"Sure, an embarrassing loss would hurt McGregor's pride, and a brutal knockout could be physically damaging. The enormity of the challenge he's facing appeared to be on his mind during a subdued performance at the final news conference Wednesday.But if he loses, he'll have plenty of time for healing and strategizing on his new 100-foot yacht in Ibiza starting next week.\"I'm already at that Forever Money stage,\" McGregor said. \"The fact of the matter is I don't have to worry about money. My focus is simply on using this opportunity to its fullest and demonstrating my skills to the world.\"Once McGregor gets back from Ibiza and finishes counting his millions, nobody knows what he'll want to do next. He'll have enough money to be finished with both sports entirely, but White believes that his numerous endorsement deals and long-term aspirations mean he won't walk away from fighting just yet.McGregor has long insisted he'll return to the UFC, and he wants to campaign in both the featherweight and lightweight divisions. He'll find no shortage of challengers eager to make big money as his opponent, with possible opponents ranging from featherweight champ Max Holloway to the winner of Tony Ferguson's bout with Kevin Lee on Oct. 7 for an interim lightweight title.There's always the possibility of a superfight with someone like Georges St. Pierre, the long-retired welterweight champion currently preparing for a middleweight title fight. The weights don't match up for McGregor, but that has never stopped him before.But if McGregor beats Mayweather, or even keeps it close, another boxing match could be irresistible.McGregor would love to pursue careers in both sports, and he has a natural foe in Paulie Malignaggi, whose much-debated recent sparring session with McGregor has sparked genuine animosity between the two.When told that McGregor likely would need a significant bump in pay to return to the UFC after his experience of boxing's more fighter-friendly pay structure, White laughed: \"I've got a feeling we're going to have that conversation, and I don't mind it. I welcome that conversation.\"McGregor has been eager to take that relationship even farther, stating in several interviews that he would like to own a share of the UFC. The promotion was purchased by WME-IMG last year for more than $4 billion.\"It's never been done, but anything is possible,\" White said in response. \"There's a lot of people who feel like they're worth this and they're worth that. We know what this kid is worth, know what I mean?\"The biggest fight of the year, Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor is available to subscribers of ONE SKY, SKYcable, Destiny Cable, SKYdirect, and SKYbroadband via SKY On Demand for P950.Existing subscribers can catch the fight by calling 4180000 or their local SKY office, texting BOXINGPPV to 23662 or by visiting www.mysky.com.ph/boxingppv.SKYdirect postpaid subscribers can text SKY to 23668; SKYdirect prepaid users can also subscribe through mysky.com.ph/boxingppvSports fans are encouraged to watch out for announcements as SKY Sports PPV will continue to offer more live sporting events.",

    "text": "MMA Jones facing discipline, questions after failing drug testFILE - In this July 7, 2016, file photo, mixed martial arts fighter Jon Jones cries as he speaks during a news conference in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)By Greg Beacham, Associated PressLAS VEGAS (AP)  Jon Jones will need an awfully good explanation for the latest major setback in his checkered mixed martial arts career.Jones could be facing a multiyear suspension after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency notified the UFC light heavyweight champion of a potential violation of the promotion's anti-doping policy.UFC President Dana White said Wednesday that the promotion likely won't know for several weeks whether the test results will be confirmed after an examination of Jones' backup sample. Any potential discipline must wait until after the adjudication process afforded to every fighter.But unless some extraordinary reason surfaces for Jones' latest failed test, the man widely considered the world's best pound-for-pound fighter is facing another lengthy absence during his prime.\"At this point, who (cares) what I think? He's done enough damage to himself,\" White said while promoting Conor McGregor's boxing showdown with Floyd Mayweather this weekend.\"His dad said it: Jon is his own worst enemy,\" White added. \"Boy, is that true. But sitting here today, it's not over yet. He's got to go through the process. Maybe there was something crazy that happened for this stuff to get into his system, so I don't know.\"Jones has been provisionally suspended by USADA, which administers the UFC's anti-drug policy. The California State Athletic Commission also has jurisdiction over Jones, who regained his light heavyweight title July 29 with a third-round stoppage of Daniel Cormier at UFC 214 in Anaheim. He failed a test conducted on a sample collected one day before the bout.\"If this holds up, and he ends up getting (a suspension of) two, three (years), it's probably the end of his career,\" White said.Under its privacy rules, USADA won't announce the substance for which Jones tested positive unless the fighter divulges it.Jones' agent, Malki Kawa, appeared on \"The MMA Hour\" podcast later Wednesday and said the fighter was told he had tested positive for turinabol, an anabolic steroid. Kawa said Jones passed two tests earlier in July, and the fighter is wondering whether he took a tainted nutritional supplement in the weeks before the bout.Kawa posted a strident defense of his client on Facebook on Wednesday.\"I know how hard he worked to get back to where he's at,\" Kawa wrote. \"This is definitely heartbreaking. He (definitely) didn't cheat or use steroids. But I'm with him more now than the night he won the belt.\"Jones hasn't publicly commented on the third failed test of his career.He tested positive for cocaine in 2015, later publicly acknowledging he had used the drug. He then received a yearlong suspension in 2016 for what he claimed was a sexual enhancement pill. His fight against Cormier was his first since that suspension ended.Penalties are compounded for multiple failed tests, and a multiyear suspension would leave the UFC without one of its rising pay-per-view draws. Jones' bad-boy image actually appears to have made him more marketable for the UFC, which has a current dearth of pay-per-view stars.Brock Lesnar, Ronda Rousey, McGregor and Georges St. Pierre are all in various stages of retirement, comebacks or more lucrative side jobs, with only St. Pierre currently scheduled for an MMA fight.Jones' mistake also throws two weight classes into upheaval.White said Cormier is likely to regain the UFC light heavyweight title, which he held twice after Jones was stripped of the belt for his first two failed tests. Cormier also reigned atop the division while Jones was sidelined following his arrest over a hit-and-run accident.Cormier has never lost to anyone but Jones, but the good-natured star will be in the same awkward position in which he found himself during Jones' previous forced absence.And Jones appeared to be ready to make an impact on the UFC heavyweight division. White had been talking to Jones' camp about matching him with heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic in Detroit later this year in what would have been a blockbuster pay-per-view matchup.Instead, Miocic must find a new opponent for his belt  and any matchup that the UFC can make will be less intriguing than a showdown with Jones.\"We've got a lot of problems if this turns out to be true, but they aren't problems compared to what Jon has,\" White said. \"The list goes on and on of what could have been with Jon Jones.\"",

Barnes, File)By Greg Beacham, Associated PressLAS VEGAS (AP)  Jon Jones could face a lengthy suspension from mixed martial arts after the UFC light heavyweight champion was notified Tuesday of his second potential violation of the promotion's anti-doping policy.Jones is widely considered the top pound-for-pound fighter in the sport, but his potential violation stems from a sample collected after his weigh-in July 28 for his title fight against Daniel Cormier at UFC 214 in Anaheim, California.Jones won the fight and reclaimed his 205-pound belt after sitting out the previous year for a failed doping test. The victory appeared to be a return to glory for a long-troubled fighter who has repeatedly hindered his stellar career with misbehavior outside the octagon.Jones was stripped of his belt in 2015 after being involved in a hit-and-run accident. He was scheduled to fight Cormier for the title in July 2016, but was pulled from the UFC 200 card for what he claimed was a failed test due to a sexual enhancement pill.Jones hasn't yet been stripped of his title for a second time, UFC President Dana White said. Cormier held the belt for most of Jones' absence, and he had said he didn't plan to retire after his second loss to Jones.Jones' camp and his manager, Malki Kawa, released a statement: \"We are all at a complete loss for words right now. Jon, his trainers, his nutritionists and his entire camp have worked tirelessly and meticulously the past 12 months to avoid this exact situation. We are having the samples tested again to determine the validity or source of contamination. Jon is crushed by this news and we are doing whatever we can as a team, to support him.\"If the violation is confirmed, Jones seems likely to face a multiyear suspension from the sport, taking away even more of his fighting prime. The UFC also will be harmed by the lengthy absence of its best fighter and a burgeoning pay-per-view draw.The UFC also could lose its dream matchup between Jones and former heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar. The superstars both appeared eager to meet next year in a heavyweight fight that would be among the biggest events in the UFC's history.The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency administers the UFC's doping policy. The California State Athletic Commission has jurisdiction over Jones' test along with USADA.",

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)By Dan Gelston, Associated PressThe UFC is turning to a high-tech platform that could enhance the way fans watch fights.The world's leading mixed martial arts promotion has reached a partnership with Heed. The joint venture between WME-IMG and AGT International wants to change the way fans connect with sports at home or at a live event through sensor-measured data.WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than $4 billion.\"Our goal is to revolutionize our sport, our events and ultimately enhance the fan experience,\" UFC CFO Andrew Schleimer said.Heed also has struck deals with Professional Bull Riders and Euroleague basketball.The new format uses sensors that collect data on everything from fan and competitor emotion to real-time event tracking that could change how fights, bull rides or other events are scored.\"This gives us a solution that is better than the human alternative to judging the difficulty of a bull ride,\" PBR CEO Sean Gleason said.Gleason said PBR would roll out a side-by-side system in January and use the Heed technology as a full replacement to human judging in 2019.\"We'll have bull meters or information on G-forces that were applied that are available in television, digital products and social apps,\" he said. \"It helps new fans understand the difficulty and nuances of bull riding.\"No bull, PBR believed science can almost reinvent the sport.Heed will outfit both bull and rider with technology that measures spin, direction changes, kicks and rider control.\"It's not only an informational and educational tool for fans but will help new fans understand the difficulties and nuances of bull rides,\" Gleason said. \"None of us have been on a bull, so it's hard to have a frame of reference to how difficult bull riding is and how athletic it is. This tool will help explain that in scientific data. That will be great for the sport. This is revolutionary, not evolutionary for our sport. We are incorporating technology into the core of our scoring and the competitive results.\"At the premier European basketball competition, the EuroLeague, sensors will be deployed in all 16 arenas. They will collect data from fans, players and coaches. Heed will transform this information into video content and performance reports for fans on site and at home through TV broadcasting, social media and other digital distribution channels.Heed sampled its technology on an old UFC fight that kept a running tally of blocks, jabs, hooks, overhands and uppercuts on the side and bottom of the screen.\"Fight Pass could be a very unique place to have some of these specific content and stories that we're creating with Heed,\" Schleimer said.Heed says its technology can track fan or fighter emotions ranging from sadness and surprise to disgust and fear. The UFC said those tools, along with the fight tracking, could help the company stay more informed on a fighter's health.\"We believe there's a tremendous opportunity for us as UFC and for the fighters to benefit from a health and safety perspective,\" Schleimer said. \"Just by virtue of the types of things that we're capturing, we're going to be very much focused on how we can leverage that to enhance our brand, our promotion and our athletes, which we're always looking to do, anything related to health and safety.\"",

Robs growth as a player on both ends of the floor makes him one of the most versatile and effective wings in the league, while his contributions of character and professionalism feature prominently in our evolving organizational culture. This extension is both well-deserved, and a really great story, Colangelo said.Through 14 games this season, Covington holds averages of 16.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 31.1 minutes per game. His scoring average, 50 percent mark from the field and 49.5 percent mark from three-point range (eighth in the NBA) all represent career-highs.The fifth-year forward has converted on 50 three-pointers this season, which ranks fourth in the NBA and he is one of just nine players in the league with at least 20 steals and 10 blocks in 2017-18. After leading the league in deflections per game a season ago, and finishing fourth in the leagues Defensive Player of the Year voting, his average of 3.4 deflections per contest this season places him fourth among NBA players.Covington is one of 14 NBA players to make at least 500 three-pointers since the start of the 2014-15 season, while his 524 three-pointers in a 76ers uniform rank fourth in franchise history, behind Hall of Famer Allen Iverson, Kyle Korver and Andre Iguodala. He has finished second on the team in steals in each of his seasons in Philadelphia and is one of 17 players league-wide with at least 350 steals in that timeframe. Just five players have both 500 threes and 350 steals in that span.Covington signed with the Sixers on Nov. 15, 2014 after being waived by Houston. In 217 games (178 starts), he holds averages of 13.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.6 steals in 28.6 minutes per game with Philadelphia. Covington originally was unselected in the 2013 NBA Draft after four seasons at Tennessee State and signed a free-agent contract with the Rockets in July 2013.",

(Photo by David Liam Kyle/NBAE via Getty Images)By Tom Withers, Associated PressCLEVELAND (AP)  The Cavaliers problems at point guard arent getting much better.Derrick Rose, who was supposed to handle starting duties while Isaiah Thomas recovers from a hip injury, could miss three more weeks with a left ankle injury that has bothered him for a month.Rose injured the ankle Oct. 20 (Oct. 21, PHL time) at Milwaukee and has missed Clevelands past five games. The team said Friday (Saturday, PHL time) that Roses ankle will be immobilized for a week and he will undergo extended treatment over the next two to three weeks.In his first season with Cleveland, the 29-year-old Rose, whose promising career has been slowed by injuries in recent years, is averaging 14.3 points in seven games. The former league MVP signed with the Cavs as a free agent this summer after spending last season with the New York Knicks.Rose has shown flashes of his All-Star form, but hasnt recovered from the ankle injury.Because hes been limited and with Thomas still likely to be out another month or more before making his Cleveland debut, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue has been forced to juggle his lineups and has used LeBron James at point guard.Hes also been forced to use Jeff Green and Dwyane Wade at the point.Iman Shumpert started at point guard during Clevelands recent road trips as the Cavs went 3-1. Shumpert started again Friday night (Saturday, PHL time) as the Cavs host the Los Angeles Clippers.We still miss a true point guard, Lue said. Its hard having to just try to mix and match and have Jeff play the point and D-Wade and different guys, but theyve been doing a good job of handling and we know hes going to be out for at least two weeks now so just keep continuing to plug away.There remains no clear timetable for Thomas to play. The two-time All-Star, acquired in the blockbuster offseason trade for Kyrie Irving, has increased his workouts in recent weeks.",

(Photo by Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images)MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)  Memphis Grizzlies guard Mike Conley is out indefinitely with a sore left heel and Achilles tendon, leaving Mario Chalmers to start in his place at least for now.The Grizzlies updated Conleys status Friday (Saturday, PHL time) after the guard consulted with the teams medical staff and other physicians. The team plans to have another update on his status in approximately two weeks.Conley will receive treatment and therapy to ease the soreness. The Grizzlies have no timetable for Conleys return, but Memphis coach David Fizdale said doctors think theres a good chance the soreness can be healed in two weeks.Its unfortunate, but watching him play in pain like that and really trying to push thru that stuff was worse to watch, Fizdale said.Fizdale said Chalmers, who tore his Achilles tendon in March 2016, will start for now. The Grizzlies also have Ben McLemore and Wayne Selden, both coming off their own injuries, as potential backcourt options. Fizdale said Conley had worked so hard this summer to be ready for how the coach wants the Grizzlies playing.For whatever reason, this thing is just not going away on its own, Fizdale said.The guard has started 12 of the Grizzlies first 14 games this season. Conley is averaging 17.1 points, 2.3 rebounds, 4.1 assists in his 11th NBA season. He has been playing an average of 31.1 minutes each game. Conley sat out Wednesday nights 116-113 loss to Indiana and also missed a Nov. 1 game against Orlando.After a strong start with two wins over Houston and a win over Golden State, the Grizzlies have lost three straight and five of their last seven to fall to 7-7 and fourth in the Southwest Division.Chalmers, who has been working to improve his own shot, is averaging eight points a game shooting 36.5 percent right now. The veteran guard knows what advice he has for Conley based on his own experience with an Achilles injury.Take your time, make sure its right, make sure its healthy before you come back, Chalmers said.",

    "text": "NBA Thompsons playmaking a steadying force for defending champsFILE - OAKLAND, CA - NOVEMBER 7: Klay Thompson #11 of the Golden State Warriors handles the ball against the New Orleans Pelicans on November 7, 2016 at ORACLE Arena in Oakland, California. (Photo by Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images)By Janie McCauley, Associated PressOAKLAND, Calif. (AP)  Klay Thompson danced unabashedly in China after winning another NBA championship, and it got shared all over social media. He smoked a stogie on the rooftop, letting loose to reveal another side of himself.I didnt plan for that video to go viral, Thompson said matter-of-factly. I was just having fun. Ive always been myself and having fun while doing it and learning to enjoy every day, because it goes by so fast.Coming to that mindset, however, has been a process for the seventh-year Golden State guard, who acknowledges for so long he put extreme pressure on himself to be the best.The quiet, more under-the-radar Warriors All-Star of the bunch, Thompson has provided a steadying hand early on for the reigning NBA champions who are favored to capture a third title in four years.I used to stress a lot more at the beginning of my career about my performance, Thompson recalled. Now, its not like I dont stress, but I play more carefree and Im more able, if I play as hard as I can Im satisfied with the results. ... I used to compare myself with all players and want to be the best so badly, but now its all about winning and having fun and realizing basketball is more of a team sport than anything.After a recent practice, Thompson dazzled right alongside a couple of visiting Harlem Globetrotters, spinning the ball on his finger, rolling it up and down his arms, off his knee and then a foot soccer-style before swishing a short jumper.I shouldve been a Globetrotter! he yelled.Its a new look for this hang-loose, beach-loving Splash Brother.The approach is working for the Warriors.He still carries the threat. You have to honor him, Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. Hes great at making the right play. Their whole team is. I think hes trying to fit in with their whole buy-in that ball movement and passing is greater than any one man carrying the bulk of it.Still, his numbers are stellar. Thompson has had a fast start this season, which previously hasnt been the case.Thompson credits the familiarity with teammates and a comfort in coach Steve Kerrs offense.Hes taken another step in his game. Just the experience that hes had in his career, every year hes gotten better and I think this year hes shown how at the end of the season he carried it over to the beginning of this year, backcourt mate Stephen Curry said. Historically he hadnt started seasons well but this year hes locked in. Hes obviously shooting the ball well and playing great defense, but I think the biggest thing is his playmaking in situations where hes drawing a crowd. Hes making great decisions setting guys up and just playing under control for the most part this entire season.Life off the court is great for Thompson, too, and that helps him be stress-free on it.Look closely, and its easy to see he has come out of his shell.On a day off last week, he golfed a popular public course close to Oracle Arena. Thompson signed someones toaster last spring, and it became a superstition.In July, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at an Oakland Athletics game, then drove an IndyCar in September while serving as Grand Marshal of a series stop in Sonoma.Thompson shares his training tricks on social media and posts photos with his bulldog, Rocco.He recently donated $75,000 to relief efforts in the aftermath of the devastating Northern California wildfires, committing $1,000 per point for a three-game stretch during which he scored 69 points  but added to that total.He is a spokesman for chocolate milk and an obscure  in the U.S. anyway  Chinese shoe company. He signed an $80 million, 10-year extension to wear the sneakers.Lifes good, Thompson said. I never thought Id get paid millions of dollars to wear shoes and apparel. Im very proud to be a part of Anta. ... Its so cool that Im big in China. I never thought Id be on billboards and posters in China.Thompson has found a balance during the offseason to stay sharp, mixing up his workouts with outdoor activities he enjoys.It took years for me to figure out how to prepare the best I can for the season. I finally learned in my sixth year, he said. Youve got to stay in shape almost year-round because as you get older its harder to get back into shape. Its easier to get out of shape than it is to get back into shape. I do other things besides basketball to stay in shape in the offseason. I think that just keeps my mind fresh.He hopes to do a formal swim from Alcatraz, or even a triathlon. He swims in the ocean  my favorite place in the world  whenever he can. Freestyle is his strength, butterfly not so much. He plays hours of beach volleyball or just throws the football around and runs routes through the sand.At work, he has been a model of consistency. Thompson is determined to be a better passer, creating for teammates whenever possible. He also usually guards the opponents top perimeter scorer.Thompson is off to his best shooting season ever, with career highs of 49.4 percent shooting from the field and 45.6 percent on three-pointers.I think his playmaking has been the best its been in his career, Kerr said. Hes really doing a good job of putting the ball on the floor and moving it on, drive and kick game, finding the centers in the pocket for little floaters. ... Its been his best passing season so far.Thompson used to get teased for his lack of assists, and it remains a running joke.I got thick skin, Thompson quipped, honestly I dont really care.That carefree approach has taken time, and the Warriors are better for it.",

(AP Photo/Doug Ferguson)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressNAPLES, Fla. (AP)  LPGA rookie Sung Hyun Park took a big first step toward sweeping all the season awards, and possibly picking up a $1 million bonus.Park made a pair of birdies over the closing stretch at Tiburon Golf Club on Thursday for a 5-under 67, leaving the 24-year-old from South Korea one shot behind after the opening round of the CME Group Tour Championship.Peiyun Chien of Taiwan and Sarah Jane Smith of Australia opened with bogey-free rounds of 66 to share the lead in a warm breeze.Park had decent separation from the other four players who only have to win the final LPGA Tour event of the year to capture the CME Race to the Globe and its $1 million bonus. As for the entire 74-player field, it was plenty crowded at the top. That includes Lydia Ko, the first of a record five players who have been No. 1 this year.Ko, who has gone 34 starts over 16 months on the LPGA Tour since her last victory, drilled a 3-wood onto the green at the par-5 17th and made the 15-foot eagle putt, then holed a bunker shot for par on the final hole for a 67.Of the top seven players on the leaderboard, Park is the only LPGA Tour winner this season.\"Nothing different from my usual play,\" Park said. \"I think I started off with a really good feel, a lot of good shots and some good putts. There is a little bit of bounce on the greens, but I think I can play well in the next rounds.\"She dropped two shots by missing the green and coming up short on pitch-and-runs up the slope, though she atoned for those mistakes with seven birdies.Park had only seen Tiburon on Wednesday during the pro-am. Her peers don't necessarily see her as a rookie because she dominated on the Korean LPGA Tour the last two years. But she's new to the LPGA Tour and already has won rookie of the year.At stake for Park is a chance to become the first rookie since Nancy Lopez in 1978 to win all the major awards.Most players headed back to their rooms to get dressed for the Rolex Awards dinner on Thursday night, which is more of a preview than a coronation because all the major awards won't be decided until Sunday.Lexi Thompson leads the Race to the CME Globe and the Vare Trophy. So Yeon Ryu has a tiny lead for player of the year. Park is leading the money list. Shanshan Feng, who made her debut at No. 1 in the world, is coming off two straight victories and can capture the Globe and player of the year with a victory.Park was the only one with a presence on the leaderboard.Thompson began by slamming her driver into the turf as she watched her opening tee shot sail so far right on the par-5 opening hole that it landed in a murky creek in the hazard. She took her penalty drop and let the club fall out of her hands as she pushed the next shot into the hazard. Thompson at least could play that shot, and she eventually holed a 6-foot putt to escape the bogey.That was the only big damage for Thompson, though some of her best putts were for par and she managed only a 71.\"I bounced back, had a good attitude out there and played some solid golf coming in,\" Thompson said.Feng opened with a birdie and holed a 25-foot birdie putt on her third hole, though her momentum stalled and she had to settle for a 70, along with Brooke Henderson, who at No. 5 in the Race to the CME Globe also can collect the $1 million bonus just by winning.Ryu had treatment on her right shoulder at the turn and battled for a 72.Park, with her lanky build and long swing, looked impervious to all the awards on the line this week. And she wasn't the least bit bothered playing alongside Thompson and Feng. She attacked the course with her driver and managed the wind with her high ball flight.\"They are playing that I played with before, so nothing particularly different today,\" she said through a translator.The surprise might have been Ko, though she has shown signs in recent months of getting her game back. Her biggest concern was the prospect of throwing away her eagle with what looked like a double bogey on the final hole. From a buried lie in the bunker, however, it came out perfectly and rattled into the cup for par and a 67.\"I don't think I've made a par like that before,\" Ko said. \"I hit it way too hard and it kind of half-plugged in the bunker. I said, 'Oh, great. What am I going to make?' Luckily, it was the perfect place to hit for a 4.\"",

(AP Photo/David J. Phillip)PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP)  Rickie Fowler woke up at 5 a.m. Saturday and played three holes in the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. It was enough to get him a three-way share of the 36-hole lead going into a marathon finish in Mexico.Fowler and Patrick Rodgers had to wait out a five-hour rain delay just to resume their second round Saturday. Fowler saved par from a bunker on the 18th hole for a 4-under 67. Rodgers finally make his first bogey of the tournament on his 17th hole had to settle for a 65.They shared the lead at 10-under 132 along with Patton Kizzire, who hasn't hit a shot since his 70 on Friday.The last three groups didn't have enough light at El Camaleon Golf Club to even start the third round, leaving them a 36-hole finish on Sunday. But that's only if the weather at this rain-plagued event allows. More thunderstorms, with heavy downpours, were in the forecast for the next two days.\"We deal with weather every once in a while on the PGA Tour, around the world, really,\" said Fowler, at No. 10 the highest-ranked player at Mayakoba. \"You kind of just learn to play when you get to play, relax when you get to relax. Rest when you can, tee it up when you can.\"Fowler had three tough finishing holes Saturday morning, and they were even more challenging after another storm moved through. There was mud on the golf balls, and it didn't help when Fowler twice wound up in bunkers. Both shots came out a little hot, but we managed to escape with pars.Rodgers finally dropped a shot when he missed the green on the par-3 eighth and failed to get up-and-down. But he saved par from right of the ninth green to at least keep in a share of the lead going into the final day. With the forecast, there was no guarantee of getting in 72 holes.Players will be allowed to lift, clean and place their golf balls through the green for Sunday.John Oda, playing the PGA Tour for the first time as a pro, shot a 65 and was one shot behind along with 31-year-old rookie Brandon Harkins and Brian Gay, neither of whom hit a shot Saturday because they were already done with their second rounds.Charles Howell III already was 4 under through six holes of the third round when darkness halted play. Howell was at 8-under par.Seventy-nine players made the cut at 1-under 141, but there will not be a 54-hole cut because the groups will stay the same over the final two rounds. Patrick Reed bogeyed three of his last four holes to miss the cut by one.Fowler hasn't played since Oct. 1 at the Presidents Cup except for a few casual rounds. He is playing at Mayakoba for the first time under the tour's \"strength of field\" policy that requires players to go to a tournament they haven't been to in the last four years.So far, he has no regrets, and not much rust.\"I'm very happy, coming from basically five weeks of very little golf played,\" Fowler said. \"There were only two rounds last week when I was playing at home that were consecutive. All the other ones were spread out. It was never far off, so I was looking forward to getting down here. Hard not to enjoy yourself when you're at a place like this where you can go hang at the beach and really throw your feet up and relax.\"Rodgers is trying not to press.He won the Jack Nicklaus Award as the nation's top college golfer when he was at Stanford, and it has been frustrating to see friends from his high school class of 2011 already have PGA Tour titles  in the case of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, plenty of them.Rodgers and Thomas once were roommates in south Florida when they turned pro.\"To be honest, at times it's been really hard because I feel like I have the game that everyone else has and I feel like I work as hard as everyone else does, but everyone has a different process and I have to be patient with that,\" Rodgers said. \"But I've always felt that I have the game to win a lot out here and I'm looking forward to a good chance this weekend.\"DIVOTS: Four of the five Mexican players in the field made the cut, let by Oscar Frausto was at 7 under and had yet to start his third round. ... Fowler's parents were supposed to join him on this working vacation until his father had surgery and his mother realized her passport had expired. ... Defending champion Pat Perez was nine shots out of the lead going into the third round.",

    "text": "Golf Mickelson geared toward winning a Ryder Cup in EuropeU.S. Team member Phil Mickelson gets his ball back after putting on the third hole during the final round of the Presidents Cup golf tournament at Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City, N.J., Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressPhil Mickelson has more than just an elusive U.S. Open title on his mind for 2018. He wants desperately to be on another Ryder Cup team, and he's willing to add tournaments to his schedule if that's what it takes.Mickelson already holds the U.S. record by qualifying for 11 consecutive teams, and he has made 23 straight appearances in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup combined. But this isn't about a streak. It's about having a chance  perhaps his last chance  to win a Ryder Cup in Europe.\"That's a big goal of mine, and if I play like I've been playing, I'll make the team,\" Mickelson said at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai.Whether he speaks from confidence or hope remains to be seen.Mickelson hasn't won since the 2013 British Open, and the last PGA Tour season was his first without recording a top-3 finish. He plans to start next year at the CareerBuilder Challenge in Southern California and play the entire West Coast from there, followed by the World Golf Championship in Mexico City.\"I'll play more tournaments if I have to,\" he said. \"I'm not sure if I have to add much. Paris is a big goal of mine, and it's important to get off to a good start.\"Mickelson has been on five losing teams held on European soil. There were two close calls. One was in 2002 at The Belfry, when the matches were tied at 8 going into Sunday singles. Europe won the last session, including Phillip Price defeating Mickelson. The other was in Wales, when Graeme McDowell won the final match for a one-point victory.Mickelson, who turns 48 in June, doesn't see Paris next September as his last chance to win in Europe. Told that he would be 52 the next time the matches go to Europe, Mickelson said, \"I'm not looking that far ahead.\"\"I'm expecting to have a good year,\" he said. \"I'd like to get on the team and go over there and win.\"___PARK ON TOP: Sung Hyun Park brought plenty of winning experience to her rookie season on the LPGA Tour.The 24-year-old Park won seven times on the Korean LPGA Tour last year, and facing the best competition in the world hasn't slowed her. Park became the fourth South Korean player to reach No. 1 in the world, and the first player to get there as an LPGA rookie.\"There won't be any changes because of the ranking,\" Park said from China, where she makes her debut at No. 1. \"I believe my future play is more important that the fact that I moved up in the ranking.\"Her future play could lead to even grander feats.Park, who won the U.S. Women's Open, leads the LPGA Tour money list at just over $2.1 million with two tournaments remaining. She is second behind So Yeon Ryu for the points-based Player of the Year and already has clinched Rookie of the Year. Not since Nancy Lopez has a player won both awards in the same season.Park also is No. 3 in the Race to the CME Globe and is second in the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average.___KOEPKA'S LIST: Brooks Koepka knew he had a big year from looking at that U.S. Open trophy. A look into his closet brought even more evidence.One of Koepka's traditions at the start of every year is to go down to the beach and write a list of goals for the year on a yellow sheet of paper. He tapes it on the wall of his closet, then invariably forgets about it.\"I'm usually looking down trying to find clothes and shoes,\" he said.A few weeks ago, he happened to look at eye level and noticed his list for the year, which had about seven items related to golf and five items off the golf course. Among the ones he ticked off was winning a major (U.S. Open), having at least a share of the first-round lead in a major (British Open) and then one of the bigger ones, having the lowest aggregate score in the majors (21-under par).He described them as \"little goals,\" only because of the detail, such as having the solo lead after the first round. He took care of that Thursday in the HSBC Champions.\"You can make them as detailed as you want,\" he said. \"When you go into specifics, a lot of those things come true.\"He didn't get them all.One goal was to not miss a cut. He missed the cut by one shot in his first tournament of the year at Torrey Pines. He also wanted to win multiple times, meaning he will have to either successfully defend at the Dunlop Phoenix next week in Japan or win the Hero World Challenge.\"The biggest change for me was off the golf course,\" Koepka said. \"The hardest thing for me was making sure I was in the gym five days a week when we played. Some days I've gone seven.\"Overall, Koepka was pleased with how many he got. He'll do it again this year, only at a different beach. Koepka will be on Maui for the Sentry Tournament of Champions.___WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?: The LPGA Tour tied a record when Stacy Lewis tied for 15th in the Toto Japan Classic. Lewis became the 15th player this year to top $1 million, equaling the number from last year.And it's about to grow.Women's PGA champion Danielle Kang is $647 short of $1 million and is assured of topping the $1 million mark next week at the CME Group Tour Championship. Minjee Lee is the defending champion this week in China. Lee is $3,268 short of $1 million, and provided she doesn't withdraw from Blue Bay, she will top $1 million.Amy Yang and Mirim Lee will have to play well next week in Naples, Florida, to have a chance. Lizette Salas and Michelle Wie are farther away, but still in range, of the $1 million mark. Both are playing in China and next week at the season finale.___DIVOTS: Four of the five winners of full PGA Tour events this fall were in the Tour Championship. ... Patrick Cantlay won in Las Vegas at 9-under 275, the highest winning score by seven shots since it became a single-course event in 2008. This was just the third time the winning score has been worse than 20-under par. ... Jason Day, who started the year at No. 1, is now at No. 12. ... The PGA of America has extended the contract of chief executive Pete Bevacqua through 2024. ... Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland, which has hosted U.S. Open sectional qualifying 30 of the last 31 years, has been selected to host the U.S. Women's Amateur in 2020. ... The PGA Tour Champions has a new title for its Tucson event  the Cologuard Classic. Cologuard, produced by Exact Sciences, is a colon cancer screening test used at home.___STAT OF THE WEEK: In the last two years, Shanshan Feng has three victories, two runner-up finishes and two third-place finishes during the LPGA Tour's fall version of the Asian swing.___FINAL WORD: \"Can we just keep playing here? Can we move the CME Group Tour Championship here? Can we move the U.S. Open here?\"  Shanshan Feng on playing LPGA Tour events in Asia.",

Justin Rose took advantage of a record-tying collapse by Dustin Johnson and rallied from eight shots behind to win the HSBC Champions.(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressSHANGHAI (AP)  Justin Rose was down to his last couple of events when he rallied from eight shots behind at the HSBC Champions to keep alive an important streak. This is his eighth consecutive year with at least one victory.His streak on the PGA Tour ended last year, though Rose counts the gold medal he won in the Olympics.\"I've prided myself on winning every year since 2010,\" Rose said. \"It's becoming harder and harder to win out here, as I've found out. It's not really a complete year unless you've hoisted a trophy. So I'm happy to have that box ticked in 2017.\"Rose had three runner-up finishes this year, including a playoff loss to Sergio Garcia in the Masters. The others were the Sony Open and BMW Championship, though he was not in serious contention in either. He finished seven behind Justin Thomas in Hawaii and five behind Marc Leishman in Chicago.\"Winning is a habit, and I felt like I was getting out of the habit,\" he said. \"The Masters, I felt like I could have won. I felt like I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't judge myself too harshly. But then you ask yourself, 'What's the reason I'm not winning?' To have that a little less prominent in my mind is important.\"Rose still has the Turkish Airlines Open and the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai before heading home to the Bahamas for the Hero World Challenge.His next goal is multiple victories in a season. He has won twice in 2010, 2014 and 2015 while playing the PGA Tour and European Tour. He has taken note of Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama each winning at least three times dating to 2015.\"That's what you have to do to be relevant on the tour,\" Rose said. \"My next evolution as a player is have a multiple-win season. The bar keeps going up, no doubt. But I feel like the young guys have inspired me of late.\"___THE 500 CLUB: With little fanfare, Charles Howell III made his 500th career start on the PGA Tour last week in the HSBC Champions.He was surprised by the milestone, and where it took place. Howell left for what he thought was a two-week swing through Asia when enough players chose not to go to Shanghai that Howell got in as an alternate. The problem was he didn't have a visa, so Howell and Chez Reavie spent nearly two days in Hong Kong waiting for it to come through. He got the visa and tied for 15th.\"So this is my 500th golf tournament on the PGA Tour,\" Howell said. \"And it's the first time I've ever played in China.\"Howell said he was shocked when he realized he had played 500 tournaments, including two times he played as an amateur. He removed his cap to show flecks of gray in his hair and laughed.\"I can't believe I've played that many PGA Tour events,\" he said. \"I didn't think I'd make it that long.\"___HAPPY TRAILS TO TORREY: Pat Perez has played Torrey Pines, the course where he grew up on in San Diego, every year since his rookie season. He has contended twice in the last four years. Adding to the occasion is that his father, Tony, is the starter on the first tee.But if he wants to announce his son teeing off, Tony Perez will have to be in Dubai.With two victories in the last year and at No. 18 in the world, Perez is ready to travel. His plan is to play in the Singapore Open the third week of January, and the following week  opposite the Farmers Insurance Open  he'll be at the Dubai Desert Classic.And to think that just eight years ago, Perez referred to himself as \"globally unknown\" when he was at the HSBC Champions. This year, he not only had an autograph request, one Chinese fan asked for a selfie. And he's going to Singapore.\"I can't believe somebody wants me,\" he said. \"I think that 'globally unknown' is not gone, but it's slowly deteriorating.\"___KUCHAR'S LOSS: Matt Kuchar is tough to beat in table tennis, at least at the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup.In China? That's different.\"No, it doesn't bother me,\" Kuchar said after losing to Dou Zecheng. \"It's their national sport. I have to get back and raise my game.\"Most amusing about this 11-point match was not that Kuchar lost, but that he didn't know the 20-year-old he played. He figured he lost to a Chinese teenager until told that Dou  known as Marty Dou in America  is a fellow PGA Tour member.\"Somebody told me who he was,\" Kuchar said with a smile. \"Hey, I fully expect when I come over here I'm going to get my head kicked in on the pingpong table. But I'm ready and willing to learn and improve.\"___CANTLAY'S PROGRESS: Being gone from golf for nearly four years because of a severe back injury makes it hard for Patrick Cantlay to compare anything with the past, and that goes for his physical condition.One thing is clear: He returned this year bigger and stronger, which has been more about filling out than bulking up.\"I think it's just age,\" said the 25-year-old Cantlay. \"I think I've always matured a little late. I'm spending more time in the gym. I'm getting older. I've gotten stronger. I'm not doing it to get bigger, just for a stronger core for my back.\"Out of golf since 2013, he had a remarkable return. He didn't miss a cut and made it to the Tour Championship while playing on 12 events. Part of that was due to an ankle injury that slowed him for two months, but as for his back, he has no limitations.These two weeks are an example of that. He flew to Shanghai for the HSBC Champions with no issues, despite spending so much time in a plane. He also decided to play this week in Las Vegas after another trans-Pacific flight.\"I can play any tournament I want. I feel good,\" Cantlay said. 'I've had no problem with travel. I'm happy with my progress.\"___DIVOTS: PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says there will not be an increase in the amount of FedEx Cup bonus money this year, the first under the new contract with FedEx. He said the \"impact\" of the new contract likely will be visible in 2018-19 with the overhaul in the schedule. ... Ricky Elliott, the caddie for U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, was voted HSBC Caddie of the Year last week in Shanghai. The previous caddie of the year, Austin Johnson, was voted best dressed. ... Jason Day fell to No. 11 this week, his first time out of the top 10 since the week before the won the Match Play Championship in February 2014. ... Dou Zecheng goes by 'Marty Dou\" when he plays in America, and it wasn't a name he picked randomly. Dou said when he went to elementary school in Canada, that's what his teacher called him. ... Mark Newell has been nominated as president of the USGA. Three-time major champion Nick Price has been nominated to serve on the executive committee.___STAT OF THE WEEK: The average world ranking of the four opposite-field event winners on the PGA Tour this year was 378.5.___FINAL WORD: \"I'd pull my hair out if I had any.\"  Bill Haas after a 76 in the third round of the HSBC Champions.",

    "text": "Golf Tiger's return ultimately measured by performanceFILE - In this Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 file photo, Tiger Woods watches his tee shot on the ninth hole of the North Course during the second round of the Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego. Tiger Woods is returning to competition at his holiday tournament in the Bahamas the week after Thanksgiving, Thursday, Nov. 23, 2017. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressTiger Woods still has more majors than comebacks.But the gap is narrowing.Woods said he will return to competition at the Hero World Challenge the week after Thanksgiving  an 18-man field in the Bahamas with no cut  just over seven months after fusion surgery. That was his fourth back surgery in a little more than two years, and that alone should be enough to temper expectations.This will be the 10th time that Woods has returned from an unscheduled break of two months or more, eight of them since winning his 14th major at Torrey Pines in the 2008 U.S. Open. And it will be the fifth time he returns since his last victory in August 2013 at the Bridgestone Invitational.Should it be cause for celebration?Of course.A popular phrase in recent years is that golf needs Woods, but this is only true as it relates to his performance. Otherwise, it becomes a nostalgia tour, and the question facing Woods is whether he can handle being a ceremonial golfer. If that's what this is about, there would be no need for him to play.This will be the second straight year that Woods makes a celebrated comeback from back surgery in the Bahamas.He had gone 15 months and two microdiscectomy surgeries when he played the Hero World Challenge last year and finished 15th against a field of 18 (Justin Rose withdrew after the opening round with back pain). Woods made 24 birdies that week but finished at 4-under par and was 14 shots behind the winner, Hideki Matsuyama.He was held to a different standard. He was measured by the freedom of his swing more than his score in relation to the field. That began to change when he missed the cut at Torrey Pines in his first start against a full field, and then flew across eight time zones to Dubai and lasted one round  a 77  before withdrawing the next day because of back spasms.Different about this return is the nature of the surgery, which carried a higher risk and was geared more toward his quality of life.Golf is a bonus.Woods made headlines at the Presidents Cup during a news conference for assistant captains when he was asked if he could see a scenario where he would not return to competition. \"Yeah, definitely,\" he responded. \"I don't know what my future holds for me. As I've told you guys, I'm hitting 60-yard shots.\"It was a leading question that was more about the uncertainty of his health than his desire to play, and the outlook changed quickly.Within a week, he posted a slow-motion video of a full swing. Then another one of Woods hitting driver, a third video hitting a stinger with a long iron, and news amid this tease that doctors had cleared him to play and practice without restrictions.So what next?For one holiday tournament, at least, Woods will be taking on a short field that is long on power and talent.Does anyone really think he can dominate the likes of Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka the way he once ruled his sport? The numbers suggest otherwise. Woods turns 42 at the end of the year and he has gone through eight surgeries  four on his left knee, four on his back.Can he win again?It would be foolish to declare that he can't by measuring Woods against the entirety of the PGA Tour.Woods announced he will play the Hero World Challenge on the week that Rod Pampling defends his title in Las Vegas. Pampling, once a frequent practice round partner of Woods at the majors, is one of the shorter hitters and won last year at age 47. Koepka was the runner-up.Pat Perez is 41 and doesn't overpower courses. He has won twice in the last two years and now is No. 18 in the world.Even without winning over the last four years while suffering from back problems, Woods has built up an enormous mystique from the previous 18 years that produced 79 victories on the PGA Tour.Thomas won five times last season. Spieth and Jason Day each won five times in 2015. Woods had 11 seasons with at least that many victories, and he had six years when he won seven times or more.\"Imagine combining the year Jordan had, the year Jason had, the year Justin had. That was Tiger Woods for my whole junior career,\" Koepka said.That's what people remember.That's why his fifth comeback since 2014 still resonates with hope.The PGA Tour celebrated the announcement of Woods' return on Tuesday with a tweet that said, \"The fist pump is back.\" For now, the only fist pump belongs to those who are eager to see him play because they were not sure they would get that chance again.How long that lasts depends on Woods.",

    "text": "Golf Dustin Johnson no longer intimidating as a closerDustin Johnson tees off on the fifth hole during the second round of the Memorial golf tournament, Friday, June 2, 2017, in Dublin, Ohio. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressSHANGHAI (AP)  No one ever can tell what's going through Dustin Johnson's head by looking at him. His expression was the same at the HSBC Champions when he was building a six-shot lead on Saturday and when he was losing it on Sunday.Leave the emotions of the surreal moment to Henrik Stenson.Suddenly one shot behind, Stenson drilled his 4-wood just short of the green at the par-4 16th and as he stood by his golf bag, he turned to the right and widened his eyes as far as they would go. It was a look that suggested, \"What's going on here?\"Johnson sure didn't have many answers.He left the 18th green with the same stoic expression that he had on the first tee when he began the final round with a six-shot lead. Instead of going to the trophy presentation on the third-floor balcony of the HSBC suite above the 18th green at Sheshan International, Johnson went into the scoring room to sign for a 77.It was his highest closing round with the 54-hole lead since his 82 at Pebble Beach in the 2010 U.S. Open.As collapses go, this was shocking for a couple reasons.Johnson had made 22 birdies through three rounds. He had none on Sunday, and he wasn't particularly close. The biggest putt he made all round was a 6-footer on the par-5 second hole to save bogey after driving into the water.Even more surprising is that Johnson is No. 1 in the world with four victories this year. He is such an imposing figure that a trio of major champions behind him  Stenson, Justin Rose and Brooks Koepka  figured they were playing for second.\"Try and win the other golf tournament,\" said Rose, who shot 67 and won the real thing.As great as Johnson is  he is No. 1 in the world for a reason  this is happening far too often.Pebble Beach was the first time Johnson played a final round with the lead, by three shots over Graeme McDowell. That was gone when Johnson made triple bogey on the second hole and then lost a ball in the bushes trying to drive the third green. Johnson learned that day to slow down.There really hasn't been another bad collapse since then. He had a two-shot lead at Doral in 2011 and finished second, although the seven players within three shots of him were all among the top 31 in the world ranking. The other times, he was tied for the lead.Even so, for someone who has piled up 16 victories, one major and five World Golf Championships in 10 years on the PGA Tour, Johnson has not established himself as a great closer.Not even close.His record with at least a share of the 54-hole lead is hard to measure. By the book, he is 7-6, but three of those victories were only three rounds because of rain at Pebble Beach in 2009, high wind at Kapalua in 2011 and a hurricane at The Barclays in 2013.Throw those out and he's 4-6.Johnson spoke just long enough Sunday to acknowledge some of the mistakes that led to his downfall, mainly chunking a short iron for his second shot on the par-5 14th that caused him to scramble for par, and chunking another one on the 15th that led to a plugged lie in a bunker and a bogey.\"That cost me two shots there,\" he said.And then he made bogey on the 16th  he made eagle there when he won the HSBC Champions in 2013  by hitting his tee shot to the left into a buried lie in Bermuda rough and leaving himself such a bad angle that he could only ask for perfection on the next shot. He missed by a yard.\"So I gave a few away,\" he said. \"But tough conditions. I mean, it is what it is.\"Johnson is not the first No. 1 player to lose a six-shot lead. Greg Norman had what remains the most famous collapse because of the stage, Augusta National in 1996, when he shot 78 and finished five shots behind Nick Faldo.Bobby Cruikshank shot an 80 to lose the 1928 Florida Open. Hal Sutton shot a 77 to lose the 1983 Anheuser-Busch Classic. Another player to lose a six-shot lead in the final round was Gay Brewer. He closed with a 73 in the 1969 Danny Thomas Diplomat Classic and was the victim of an Arnold Palmer charge. The other two on that dubious list were Sergio Garcia in 2005 at Quail Hollow and Spencer Levin in 2012 at Phoenix.If there is cause for concern with Johnson, it's his putter. He switched models when he won the BMW Championship last year and used that putter through three straight victories in the spring that took him to No. 1. He switched back to the putter that he used in 12 previous victories, including the U.S. Open. He brought a different putter with a mallet head to China, and that lasted one round. He took possession of a fourth putter 15 minutes before he shot 63 on Friday.Will this collapse scar Johnson? Probably not. Johnson has a short memory, one of his many strengths.Just don't expect anyone chasing him on Sunday to think they're playing for second, no matter how large the lead.",

While sponsor exemptions are limited to the top 50 in the world, Woods is exempt as the tournament host.His latest procedure was a fusion surgery  the previous three were microdiscectomy surgeries  and Woods reported instant relief. He also said just one month ago at the Presidents Cup that he had no idea what his future held.Doctors gave him clearance to practice without limitations about a week later, and Woods had been posting video on Twitter of a full swing with an iron, a driver and then his signature stinger shot with the driver.\"I am excited to return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge,\" Woods said in a story on his website. \"Albany is the perfect setting and it will be great to join this outstanding field.\"The tournament has no cut.A year ago, Woods returned after 15 months recovering from two back surgeries. He made 24 birdies, but finished 15th out of 18 players. The tournament is not official on any tour, although it does award world ranking points.He made his first PGA Tour start at Torrey Pines and missed the cut, and then went to Dubai and didn't make it past the first round before his back began acting up.Woods made the announcement just three days after he pleaded guilty to reckless driving in a deal that allows him to avoid jail time if he doesn't violate terms of his probation.The deal stems from a Memorial Day arrest on a DUI charge when Woods was found asleep at the wheel of his car, which was still running and parked at an awkward angle about 15 minutes from his home in Florida.Woods attributed it to a bad combination of prescription medicine.According to a toxicology report, Woods had the active ingredient for marijuana, two painkillers, the sleep drug Ambien and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in his system.He completed a drug treatment program in July.Woods has 79 PGA Tour victories and 14 majors, both second all-time, though he has not won since the Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013 for his record 18th World Golf Championships title.",

Woods has pleaded guilty to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program to settle a charge of driving under the influence. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)By Curt Anderson and Terry Spencer, Associated PressPALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Tiger Woods pleaded guilty Friday to reckless driving in a deal that will keep him out of jail as long as he stays out of trouble, resolving charges from an arrest last spring in which he was found passed out in his Mercedes with prescription drugs and marijuana in his system.Woods spoke only briefly during a hearing at a Palm Beach County courthouse, answering questions from a judge about his plea agreement. Prosecutors dropped a driving under the influence charge for the superstar golfer, and the judge warned him to behave.\"This particular plea agreement has no jail time on it. However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and then I could sentence you to jail for 90 days with a fine of up to $500, is that understood?\" Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo said.Woods, 41, nodded. He did not make any statement during the hearing or outside the courthouse.Woods will enter a diversion program and spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. He has already met some of the program's other requirements, completing 50 hours of community service at the Tiger Woods Foundation, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said.Aronberg didn't say specifically what Woods did with the charitable group, but said he met the terms of the deal. Woods also attended a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged.Aronberg said most DUI offenders do not qualify for the diversion program because they have a prior record or were in an accident. About 2,500 first-time offenders have graduated from the county program since it began four years ago.\"This is designed for first-time offenders, where the person made a one-time mistake and they're going to overcome it,\" Aronberg said. \"Mr. Woods was treated like any other defendant in his situation.\"Since he was intoxicated with prescription drugs and marijuana, according to court records, he will also be required to undergo regular drug tests. Woods is also not allowed to drink alcohol.Woods arrived at the courthouse in a black sport utility vehicle, wearing sunglasses and a dark suit with no tie. Police officers surrounded him as he walked down a hallway inside the courthouse and they ringed the inside of the courtroom during the high-profile proceeding.Woods was arrested about 2 a.m. May 29 when officers found him unconscious in his Mercedes, which was parked awkwardly on the roadside and had damage to the driver's side.It's not clear how he damaged the car. Officers checked the area but didn't find that he had hit anything. He was about 15 miles from his home.His arrest was recorded by an officer's dashcam video and released to the public.Woods had the active ingredient for marijuana, two painkillers  Vicodin and Dilaudid  the sleep drug Ambien and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in his system but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report released in August. He completed a drug treatment program in July.Woods has said he had been self-medicating to relieve the pain from his fourth back surgery and insomnia.The DUI arrest was the first time Woods had been in trouble since Thanksgiving weekend 2009, when he plowed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his then-Windermere, Florida, home. That led to revelations that he had multiple extramarital affairs and a divorce from his wife Elin Nordegren, the mother of his two children. He spent 45 days in a Mississippi clinic where he was treated for an addiction.Woods' 79 PGA Tour victories and 14 major titles both rank No. 2 all-time. He has not competed since February because of his back injury and is not expected to return this year. His last win was in August 2013.Woods has said his back is improving. Even though he has been a non-factor on the PGA Tour, Forbes Magazine lists Woods as the 17th best-paid athlete in the world in 2017, making $37 million, almost exclusively from endorsements.",

(AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili, File)By Terry Spencer, Associated PressFORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP)  The diversion program for intoxicated drivers that Tiger Woods is expected to enter Wednesday is one of several across the U.S. aimed at reducing the number of repeat offenders and backlogs of court cases.The 41-year-old Woods is scheduled to plead guilty at a court hearing to reckless driving, a less severe charge than driving under the influence, as part of a Palm Beach County, Florida, program that has graduated almost 2,500 first-time offenders since it began four years ago.Deputy State Attorney Richard Clausi, who oversees the county's misdemeanor prosecutions, said that less than 1 percent of the program's participants have reoffended. He said the key has been getting offenders to take responsibility for their actions without requiring a trial and making sure they complete the program.\"It's still early, but we think it has been a success,\" he said.In the diversion program, Woods will spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. He also must attend DUI school, perform 20 hours of community service and attend a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged. Since he was intoxicated with prescription drugs and marijuana, according to court records, he will also be required to undergo regular drug tests.At the hearing, he must show he has started the program. If he completes it, he can ask a judge to expunge the reckless driving conviction, but if he is charged again, he could be treated like a second-time DUI offender. He would not be again eligible for diversion and he could face possible jail time, a mandatory license suspension and stiffer fines.Similar DUI diversion programs are offered in several other states, including Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas. Details vary and some, like Florida, let local officials decide whether to offer it.Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor Mothers Against Drunk Driving knew of any recent outside studies examining whether diversion programs are effective.J.T. Griffin, MADD's chief government affairs officer, said the organization supports diversion programs like Palm Beach County's because for drunken drivers, it requires the installation of an interlock device, which checks the driver's blood-alcohol content before the car can be started. He said studies show interlocks decrease recidivism among first-time offenders by 65 percent.\"It is good for the public because 50 to 75 percent of drunk drivers are going to continue to drive, even on a suspended driver's license,\" Griffin said. \"With an ignition interlock, they can keep driving but in a safe way and the hope is that they will learn their lesson.\"Woods was arrested about 2 a.m. May 29 when officers found him unconscious in his Mercedes-Benz, which was parked awkwardly on the roadside and had damage to the driver's side. It's not clear how he damaged the car. Officers checked the area but didn't find that he had hit anything. He was about 15 miles from his home.Woods had the active ingredient for marijuana, two painkillers  Vicodin and Dilaudid  the sleep drug Ambien and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in his system but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report released in August.Woods issued a statement in August saying he had been self-medicating for pain caused by his fourth back surgery and insomnia. He did not specifically address the marijuana issue. None was found in his possession.\"I realize now it was a mistake to do this without medical assistance,\" Woods said then. He completed a drug treatment program in July.Woods' attorney, Douglas Duncan, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment about Wednesday's hearing.The DUI arrest was the first time Woods had been in trouble since Thanksgiving weekend 2009, when he plowed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his then-Windermere, Florida, home.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressTiger Woods is swinging a driver without pain, and his agent says doctors have cleared him to practice without limitations.Still to be determined is when Woods can play in a tournament.We havent even addressed when he comes back to play again. We have not addressed one thing, said Mark Steinberg, his agent at Excel Sports Management. He wants to play this so conservatively.Steinberg said Woods received a good report last week from doctors who performed fusion surgery on his lower back in April. Woods posted a video on Twitter on Oct. 7 of him hitting a smooth iron shot. Then on Sunday, Woods posted another video  in a red shirt, no less  hitting a driver.Making progress, he tweeted.Woods, whose last victory was four years ago at the Bridgestone Invitational for his record 18th World Golf Championships title, has not played since he withdrew from the Dubai Desert Classic on Feb. 3 because of back spasms.Two months later, he had a fourth surgery on his back in 19 months.Woods first posted a video on Aug. 31 hitting pitch shots. Steinberg said doctors last week allowed him to proceed with no restrictions, which is when he began posting video of fuller golf shots.He has started to hit balls at a more aggressive rate, Steinberg said. He feels really good, but hes going to take it very slowly. I think hes excited that hes not feeling pain. Thats what gets him excited, being able to bend down and pick up his kids.Hes taking it from wedges and short irons to the longer clubs. But hes still doing it in a really cautious manner.Woods was an assistant captain at the Presidents Cup two weeks ago, and he said then his priorities were to get his health in order, make sure he is pain-free and then wait on word from his doctors.Im still training. Im getting stronger, he said on Sept. 27. But I certainly dont have my golf muscles trained.Woods last year returned after 15 months to play in his Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, where he finished 15th against an 18-man field. The tournament is a week after Thanksgiving. Two spots are still available for sponsor exemptions to players in the top 50 in the world, or to the tournament host, which is Woods.",

(AP Photo/Dave Thompson)ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP)  After completing only the second winless season of his 10-year professional career, Rory McIlroy will put his clubs away for six weeks and plot a way to regain his aura of old.McIlroy finished a frustrating, injury-hit 2017 season with an even-par 72 at St. Andrews in his final round at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.\"It summed up my whole of 2017: Not much happening,\" McIlroy said. \"Couldn't get out of neutral.\"Former top-ranked McIlroy, who has had two spells out of action this year because of injury, has dropped to No. 6 in the world  behind players like 24-year-old Americans Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas and rising Spanish star Jon Rahm, who is age 22. The last of McIlroy's four majors came at the PGA Championship in 2014.\"I feel I'm a much better player than I was in 2011 and 2012, when I was able to win a couple of majors,\" the 28-year-old McIlroy said. \"I feel I can do better than that in the next 10 years and that's why these next three months are very important for me to put some really good things in place, step away and just reassess where I'm at and where I need to be.\"The landscape of the game has changed a bit since I started to win majors. You have young, hungry guys now who are fearless and playing the game how I basically came out and played a few years go. It's about gaining an advantage again here and there. Just reassessing everything and making sure I'm not leaving any stone unturned and do everything I can to get back to (being) the best player in the world.\"McIlroy said he will not start hitting balls again until the end of November, and will focus on rehab and \"getting my body right.\" A rib injury sustained at the SA Open in January forced him to have six weeks off, and the problem resurfaced at times.Putting and wedge play have been his biggest weaknesses this year, said McIlroy, who added that \"basically all areas of my game could get a little bit better.\"McIlroy turned pro in 2007 and failed to win a title the following year. Since 2009, he has won 21 titles worldwide.",

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)By James Raia, Associated PressNAPA, Calif. (AP)  Four days after a strong showing in the United States' victory in the Presidents Cup, Phil Mickelson begins his 27th PGA Tour season Thursday seeking his first individual win since 2013 in the season-opening Safeway Open.Mickelson, winner of 42 career PGA Tour events including five majors, will be joined at Silverado by 12-time PGA Tour winner Zach Johnson as well as Emiliano Grillo and Adam Hadwin, who also played in the Presidents Cup.\"I'm really excited to play because I have been playing well,\" the 47-year-old Mickelson said. \"I am excited to get back into competition. I am going to have a good chance.\"Mickelson, who had five top-10 finishes last season in 22 events, is playing in his 91st tour event since his win at the 2013 British Open.\"My game is back to where I've been wanting it to be, and I have an opportunity to start the new season with a little bit of momentum,\" said Mickelson, who opened last season with an eighth-place finish in the Safeway Open, shooting four rounds in the 60s. \"It's a fun, strategic golf course and there are multiple ways to play it. So when you feel well, you take a little bit more aggressive lines off the tee.\"Mickelson has 11 PGA Tour titles in California, his home state.\"I think a lot of the guys struggle with the poa annua greens, which is a grass I grew up playing,\" he said. \"I am very comfortable on the greens. If you grew up in Florida on Bermuda grass, this is a very awkward surface to putt on. The color is different and it's sometimes hard to read.\"Johnson, playing in the event for the first time, is seeking his first PGA Tour win since the 2015 British Open.\"My game feels good and that's part of the reason I'm here,\" said Johnson, who had four top-10 finishes last season including second in the Bridgestone Invitational, a World Golf Championship. \"I look at what I have in front of me the next month and a half or so, and I might have seven or eight weeks off. That's a bit too much. I think it's good to stay competitive. I thought this week is a really good way to stay fresh and get some work done and the assess.\"Last year's winner, Brendan Steele, and well as fellow former champions Jonas Blixt (2012), Sangmoon Bae (2014) and Grillo (2015) also are in the field.Steele birdied his last three holes to overcome a four-shot deficit for his second PGA Tour victory with a one-shot margin last year over Patton Kizzire.Bae, a two-time PGA Tour winner, is making his first PGA Tour start since a mandatory two years of military service in South Korea. He last played in the 2015 Presidents Cup.Maverick McNeal, 21, the former world's top amateur and Stanford standout, is making his pro debut after eight amateur starts on the PGA Tour.John Daly, a two-time major winner who last May claimed his first PGA Tour Champions title, also in the field on a sponsor exemption.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)By Doug Ferguson, Associated PressJERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP)  Phil Mickelson hasn't had his fill, not when it comes to the Cup.Especially the next one.Mickelson saved some of his best golf in one of his worst years for when it really counted. Steve Stricker wanted to see some life from Lefty before deciding to use a captain's pick on him for the Presidents Cup, and Mickelson delivered with four rounds in the 60s at the TPC Boston to tie for sixth.The pick extended his record streak to 23 consecutive teams, and Mickelson delivered another strong performance on the course and in the team room. He went 3-0-1 at Liberty National, one of four Americans to go unbeaten.But it was a passing comment in Chicago, the week after he was chosen for the Presidents Cup, that shed some insight into his immediate future. He is starting a new season this week at the Safeway Open, which was expected because his management company runs the tournament.\"Looks like I'm probably going to go to China, too,\" Mickelson said.China?Mickelson is a two-time winner at Sheshan International, but he has played the HSBC Champions only once in the last four years. Why now? One reason  perhaps the only reason  is because the World Golf Championship in Shanghai is the only tournament in the fall that offers Ryder Cup points.This is one team Mickelson doesn't want to miss.He turns 48 next year and is still trying to manage psoriatic arthritis, which affected his energy and focus this year. Mickelson realizes his time is running out as a player in the Ryder Cup. He has played on three winning teams, all in America.Next year's matches are in France. This might be Mickelson's last chance to win a Ryder Cup in Europe.\"That's the one thing I haven't done,\" he said in Chicago.And the opportunity has never looked better.The Americans suddenly look a lot like Europeans when only a gold trophy, not cash, is on the line. They have developed a formula of familiarity, and they have relationships that go beyond the team room. Not even Europe had that. Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger grew up together in junior golf and graduated high school the same year. Thomas lives down the street from Rickie Fowler.\"You look at the camaraderie of the young players and how they support each other, even outside of these team events,\" Mickelson said. \"They have a support system where they love competing against each other, love beating each other, but are genuinely happy for each other's success. And that leads to a very positive, uplifting energy in the team room.\"And I think that these young guys ... really lay a solid foundation for the U.S. teams.\"The performance in the Presidents Cup  a 19-11 victory, a beating so thorough the Americans were one match away from ending it on Saturday  made it tempting to look ahead one year to the Ryder Cup with the belief it will turn out the same way.If the Europeans were watching, should they be nervous?\"It's more confidence for us than anything they would be worried about,\" Spieth said.That alone might be enough to worry.The Americans have figured something out, and Mickelson was behind that, too.He's the one who put his image on the line at Gleneagles after the 2014 Ryder Cup with his passive-aggressive criticism of the way Tom Watson ran the team and his incredulous tone when asking why the Americans got away from what had worked for them in Valhalla when they won in 2008.That led to the task force, in which the players lobbed for consistency and control.And it appears to be working.\"They got better at doing what Europe does than what Europe did,\" said Geoff Ogilvy, an assistant captain for the International team. \"And we paid the price. Europe made America better. ... Europe plays with such spirit, and that's what it is. What you see with that U.S. team, isn't it a bit of that European spirit?\"Does that translate to the Ryder Cup? Not necessarily. The Americans have been feeling good about themselves after the Presidents Cup for the last decade and they have only two Ryder Cup victories to show for it.The Ryder Cup is a different monster. Mickelson knows that better than anyone. And that's why he's so desperate to be there.\"There will be a point where I look back and I remember, cherish, talk about all the experiences and memories that have been created,\" he said of his 23 appearances in the Cups. \"Right now, I'm still trying to make more. I have not been a part of a Ryder Cup victory in Europe. It's a big goal of mine. We have the players, the foundation, and the direction. I want to be part of that team next year.\"",

Tomas anew, 71-69.Desiderio was on-point from the get-go and scattered 10 points while Manzo showed no ill effects of the leg injury he suffered just three days earlier by tallying 11 markers of his own.Janjan Jaboneta was also a pleasant surprise with 12 points.With those three at the head of the attack, State U has now barged back into the win column following a dispiriting three-game slide.The Cebuano connection definitely wasnt alone, however, as they were joined by three other teammates in the 13-2 second quarter run that erased a two-point deficit and erected a 31-22 advantage.They would never look back from there all the way to a 4-4 standing  now at solo fifth just ahead of idle 3-4 National University.In the first round meeting between the two teams, a Desiderio triple in the dying seconds lifted UP to a season-opening win.It was the Tigers turn to mount some sort of rally in this one, but they could only come as close as 69-70 with 11 ticks to go courtesy of a cold-blooded triple from Marvin Lee.Manzo was right there to hammer down the final nail on their coffin, however, by splitting from the stripe.UST still had nine seconds for a game-tying or game-winning basket and Lee launched a would-have-been devastating missile only to see it go in and out.As such, they remain winless through eight games.

They were able to deliver and hold the fort for the team, Pumaren said.With the Bulldogs closing in to 65-70 inside the last seven minutes, four different players got together for the 9-2 counter that re-established a 79-67 advantage in favor of UE.That double-digit lead would stay with them until the final buzzer.Olayon wound up with an all-around 17 points, eight assists, and six rebounds while Maloles and Abanto chipped in 13 markers each of their own to carry their team to 2-6 in the standings.Although he only played 19 minutes due to foul trouble, Pasaol still had a double-double with 10 rebounds to his name.After starting the season with six losses in a row, the Red Warriors are now streaking. If we wanna make a run, we know we have to start the second round on a winning note, Pumaren said.For NU, J-Jay Alejandro gave it his all and had 16 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds while Issa Gaye posted a 20-point, 13-rebound double-double.With no impact after those two, however, they fell for the fourth time in the last five games and for the fifth time overall in eight games.BOX SCORESUE 90  Olayon 17, Bartolome 14, Maloles 13, Abanto 13, Pasaol 11, Manalang 7, Cullar 6, Derige 3, Varilla 2, Acuno 2, Conner 2NU 77  Gaye 20, Alejandro 16, Bartlett 8, Salem 7, Mosqueda 7, Yu 5, Joson 4, Lastimosa 4, Morido 3, Aquino 3, Diputado 0, Rangel 0, Tibayan 0, Abatayo 0, Cauilan 0QUARTER SCORES: 21-15, 45-36, 62-59, 90-77---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Thirdy Ravena and Ateneo remain an unsolvable riddle in the UAAP 80 Men's Basketball Tournament.Ateneo de Manila University has the number of Adamson University in the 80th Season of the UAAP Mens Basketball Tournament.Imposing their will from start to finish, the Blue Eagles outclassed the Soaring Falcons anew, 71-59, on Saturday at the Araneta Colisuem.With the 12-point win, Ateneo completes an elimination round sweep of Adamson. This, as an encore to their 85-65 win in the first round.More than that, they keep their perfect record intact now at 8-0.The game turned out to be a defensive battle early on, but the Katipunan-based squad was still able to nudge ahead, leading by seven, 31-24, at the half. It was a defensive game. Adamson is a very good defensive team, but the third quarter was the pivotal cushion we needed, coach Sandy Arespacochaga said.Then the third quarter rolled along and Thirdy Ravena and Isaac Go merged for 13 points and, as a team, they outscored their opponents, 23-17.The advantage would only bloat to as big as 21, 71-50, late in the game as even seldom-used BJ Andrade contributed a triple.Ravena was the lone player in double-digits with 15 points on top of nine rebounds and two assists, but five other of his teammates chipped in somewhere between six to eight markers.Though it remains in the league lead, Ateneo is adamant that there is much room for improvement. Were not looking at our record right now. Thats what we keep emphasizing, Arespacochaga said.That didnt seem to be the case in this one as at the defensive end, they suffocated the Adamson backcourt of Jerrick Ahanmisi, Rob Manalang, and Koko Pingoy to only 16 points in 6-of-24 shooting.The rest of the Soaring Falcons werent much better either as, in all, they only made good on one of 18 attempts from long distance.Papi Sarr was their lone bright spot with 15 points and nine rebounds. those go along with six turnovers, however.With such cold shooting, they see their four-game win run come to an end.

Jasper Parker and FEU got a much-needed boost courtesy of a blowout of lowly UST.Coming off back-to-back losses, Far Eastern University needed some sort of boost to once again get going in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.The Tamaraws got just that up against undermanned and underwhelming University of Sto. Tomas for a 96-70 laugher of a win at the Filoil Flying V Centre, Sunday.At the losing end against Adamson University and De La Salle University in the last two games, the boys from Morayta showed a much-needed sense of urgency in this one.FEU never trailed and never took its foot off the pedal en route to a much-needed bounce back win that improves its standing to 5-4. Sinwerte lang kami na wala yung top two players nila  Akomo and Sta. Ana. It is what it is so good win for us, head coach Olsen Racela said.Jasper Parker and Ron Dennison caught fire from the get-go as they took full advantage of their opponents who did not have both Steve Akomo and Jordan Sta. Ana due to illness and injury, respectively.Those two boosted their team to a 44-18 start.At the half, the Tamaraw bench had 27 points all to themselves  matching the output of all their opponents.Their lead would only increase to as much as 66-30 in the third quarter with Axel Inigo joining in on the fun with a nifty layup.In all, Parker and Dennison combined for 19 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two steals while Kenneth Tuffin and Arvin Tolentino scored 14 and 13 points, respectively.All of FEU were on-point as they counted 15 players who contributed in the scoring column. Maganda ang shooting namin today and more than that, I like our unselfishness, Racela said.With the win, the boys from Morayta pushed to the brink of elimination their nearby rivals from Espana.Oliver De Guzman and Jeepy Faundo each had 17 points to top the scoring column for them.Now at 0-9, the Tigers reset their worst start to the season since 1994.

Ben Mbala made sure DLSU was getting back at UP.The University of the Philippines needed a perfect game to upset De La Salle University.All the defending champions needed was their usual game to restore order in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.Ben Mbala manhandled everybody thrown at him while also shutting down Paul Desiderio as the Green Archers crushed the confidence of the Fighting Maroons with an emphatic 85-62 win on Sunday at the Filoil Flying V Centre.The reigning and defending MVP imposed his will to the tune of 27 points, 14 rebounds, three assists, and two blocks and played the part of primary defender on Desiderio.With the six-foot-seven Mbala on him, the King Maroon only had seven points in 2-of-13 shooting.Still, it was when Mbala was on the bench when DLSU broke away. Ricci Rivero, Kib Montalbo, Aljun Melecio, and Jollo Go all got together for the 14-0 spurt that turned a one-point deficit in the middle of the first into a 27-14 advantage at the start of the second.They would not look back from there all the way to a second straight win that hikes their record to 7-2.Rivero wound up with 20 points while Montalbo finally shook off his struggles with 12 points, three rebounds, three assists, and one assist.In the first round meeting between the two teams, all went right for UP en route to a 98-87 shocker of a win.

Jerrick Ahanmisi and Adamson have now won five of their last six games.Adamson University needed three quarters and a half to put down University of the East on Wednesday at the MOA Arena.But once they did, they werent looking back all the way back onto the win column in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.Banking on tireless effort from everybody from Jerrick Ahanmisi to Sean Manganti, the Soaring Falcons held off feisty the Red Warriors for a 66-57 decision.Facing off with a UE side on its first winning streak in the season, Franz Pumaren and his boys knew they were in for a fight. It was not an easy game for us. We struggled. UE was on a streak and they really played well, the head coach said.Indeed, Manong Derricks wards were all ready and raring, keeping close for majority of the matchup and still well in it, 54-59, inside the last four minutes.It was at that point, however, that Manganti drilled a corner triple and drained a reverse layup to bookend the 7-1 run that closed the contest for Adamson.Sandwiched between those Manganti makes was a Ahanmisi midrange jumper that made up two of his 14 points. Were winning because were playing as a team. Its a collective effort not only on defense, but also on offense, Pumaren said.Papi Sarr posted a 12-point, 15-rebound double-double while Manganti also added 10 markers, seven boards, and two assists to make sure the Soaring Falcons rose back to a 6-3 record, strengthening their stranglehold on the third spot.This was a much-wanted win as the Soaring Falcons head into a rematch with defending champion De La Salle University.Alvin Pasaol paced the Red Warriors with 22 points, 12 rebounds, two assists, and two steals which still were not enough to prevent their drop back down into the loss column.After back-to-back wins, they now stand at 2-7.BOX SCORESADAMSON 66  Ahanmisi 14, Sarr 12, Manganti 10, Camacho 6, Bernardo 6, Pingoy 5, Manalang 5, Lojera 2, Ochea 2, Hill 2, Mustre 2, Paranada 0, Espeleta 0UE 57  Pasaol 22, Olayon 16, Bartolome 4, Maloles 3, Manalang 2, Acuno 2, Abanto 2, Cullar 2, Conner 2, Armenion 2, Varilla 0, Derige 0QUARTER SCORES: 19-16, 35-30, 55-48, 66-57---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Ateneo is now assured of at least a playoff for a Final Four berth.For the first time in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament, Ateneo de Manila University was behind at halftime of its matchup with National University.Still, the Blue Eagles were able to dig deep both into their character and into their lineup to tighten the leash around National University, 85-72, on Wednesday at the MOA Arena.Dominant through the tournament, the league-leaders remain undefeated through nine games.Unlike the previous games, however, Ateneo had to come from behind as it trailed by three at the half and still by two late in the third. NU played hard and we didnt match their energy. Credit goes to our players who did the necessary adjustments, coach Sandy Arespacochaga said.From that 61-63 deficit, four different players joined forces in a scintillating 15-3 surge that put the Blue Eagles on top, 76-66, with six minutes remaining.They would not be threatened the rest of the way as J-Jay Alejandro got shackled by Gian Mamuyac and Thirdy Ravena.The King Bulldog had 16 points in 5-of-11 shooting in the first two quarters, but with Mamuyac and then Ravena all over him, only had six points in 2-of-9 shooting in the second half. Thirdy and Gian did a great job on him. You cannot hold him to zero points so six points in the second half was good for us, Arespacochaga said.At the other end, Ravena fronted the offensive with 15 points on top of eight rebounds, two assists, two steals, and two blocks while Mamuyac contributed eight markers and four dimes.Matt Nieto and Jolo Mendoza also added 10 points apiece to help Ateneo assure itself of at least a playoff for a Final Four berth.For NU, Alejandro was the lone bright spot also with seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals. Enzo Joson was the only other player in double-digits for them with 11 points.With Issa Gaye and Matt Salem combining for only 15 points in 6-of-20 shooting to go along with three turnovers, however, they fell for the fifth time in the last six games.

    "text": "UAAP DLSU outworks high-flying Adamson for third win in a rowGOIN TO WORK. Ricci Rivero and Santi Santillan energized DLSU right through Adamson and all the way to a third win in a row.Adamson University had all the highlights, but De La Salle University had all the hustle on Saturday at the Araneta Coliseum.All that tireless work paid off in a big way as the Green Archers yet again got the better of the Soaring Falcons, 80-74, for their third consecutive victory in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.Ben Mbala remained a force even with a quiet, for his standards, 15-point, 17-rebound double-double while Santi Santillan was all over the place to energize the defending champions. This game was a test of character for all of us. This is a good thing kasi it will help us as a team, Ricci Rivero said post-game.Adamson was pushing all the right buttons in the first half and even had a 10-point lead before DLSU finally figured things out.Coming in for the foul-plagued Prince Rivero in the third quarter, Santillan outhustled all of their opponents and had four points coming off offensive rebounds in the 8-2 run that erased a two-point deficit and erected a 56-50 advantage for their team.That was far from the end of it, however, as Kib Montalbo's unsportsmanlike foul on Tyrus Hill put the Soaring Falcons on top, 72-71, inside the last two minutes.The Green Archers wasted no time in recovering and found Andrei Caracut for a booming triple from the top of the key for the go-ahead basket.After the two teams traded defensive stops, Santillan then beat Hill for a short stab that put up a 76-72 edge for them.That margin would prove to be more than enough in the defending champions rise to 8-2  still solo second.The transferee from University of the Visayas wound up with a career-high 16 points on top of 10 rebounds and two assists to finish the game outworking his counterpart in Hill who had eight markers, two boards, two dimes, and a couple of highlight reel dunks.Sobrang magic bunot si Santi. Nung first, nag-start siya tapos ang tagal niyang nabangko, Rivero shared. Yun pala, may plan pala si coach. Santi will do everything to help the team.Rivero topped the scoring column with 17 points while Kib Montalbo peppered 10 points, five rebounds, three steals, and two assists.For Adamson, Jerrick Ahanmisi and Papi Sarr had 17 points apiece to show the way.Unable to sustain their hot start, however, they dropped their second in the last three games. Still, they stand in third-place holding a 6-3 record.BOX SCORESDLSU 80  Rivero R 17, Santillan 16, Mbala 15, Montalbo 10, Rivero P 7, Melecio 5, Tratter 5, Caracut 3, Baltazar 2, Go 0ADAMSON 74  Ahanmisi 17, Sarr 17, Espeleta 12, Manalang 11, Hill 8, Lojera 3, Manganti 2, Ochea 2, Bernardo 2, Pingoy 0, Zaldivar 0, Mustre 0, Chua 0, Frias 0QUARTER SCORES: 13-17, 35-35, 58-54, 80-74---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

    "text": "UAAP Ateneo comes from behind against FEU to clinch first playoff berthPLAYOFF-BOUND. It's a certainty now - Raffy Verano and Ateneo can continue their dominance in the UAAP Final Four.Whatever happens from here on out in the eliminations of the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament, Ateneo de Manila University will be sticking around for the next round.Knocked down by Far Eastern University in the earlygoing on Saturday at the Araneta Coliseum, the Blue Eagles just got back up before throwing a haymaker of their own in the endgame for a 70-59 come from behind win.The league-leaders seemed out of sync in the first half, even finding themselves in a 12-point hole before regrouping in the in the last 15 minutes of the game. We didnt start off on the right foot. We had a bad first quarter, but we are quite happy with the final three quarters, coach Sandy Arespacochaga said.They were still down by five, 47-52, early in the fourth before six different players got together for a 15-2 rally and a 62-54 lead with under five minutes remaining.Ateneo would not look back from there all the way to their 10th win in as many games.Still well ahead of the pack, they are the first team to clinch a playoff berth. We are happy to be in this position, but we also remain focused on whats ahead, Arespacochaga said.Matt Nieto and Raffy Verano made sure of that as each scored 14 points. Thirdy Ravena had for himself an off-game, for his standards, only with six points and six rebounds.Of course, the all-around forward didnt have to do much heavy lifting as, in all, the Blue Eagles suffocated their opponents into only nine points in the last 10 minutes while scoring 23 points of their own.Also, they are four wins away from a sweep of the elimination round and an automatic advance into the Finals.With three of their last four assignments coming against teams at the bottom half of the standings, that is very much a possibility. Still, Arespacochaga shared that their sights are not set on that by saying, Its a possibility, but were just taking it game by game.For the Tamaraws, Ron Dennison topped the scoring column with 12 points on top of eight rebounds.They ran out of gas in the endgame, however, and drop to 5-5 in the standings. They are still at solo fourth, but have 4-5 University of the Philippines and 3-6 University of Sto.

J-Jay Alejandro and NU played the part of executioner to UST's contention.Just 10 games into the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament, University of Sto. Tomas contention has come to a close at the hands of National University.Riding a 24-6 third quarter surge, the Bulldogs pulled off a 91-83 win on Sunday at the Filoil Flying V Centre while also pushing off the Tigers into a 0-10 hole they will not be able to get out of.Losers of five or the last six, the decision was much welcome for the Sampaloc-based squad who sent a statement that they arent going away just yet now at 4-6.Making the win even more special was the fact that legendary alumnus Danny Ildefonso was calling the shots in place of head coach Jamike Jarin who was serving a one-game suspension. First of all, thank you sa mga players dahil may instruction kami pero sila pa rin naman ang naglalaro, he told reporters post-game.Still, it definitely come easy as UST looked like a team on a mission and even went on a 17-5 run bridging the middle quarters to turn a five-point deficit into a 52-45 lead.It was at that point that team captain J-Jay Alejandro rallied his troops and had four assists as four other Bulldogs teamed up in the 24-6 surge that put them way ahead, 69-58, late in the third.The Tigers would last threaten at 81-86 inside the last four minutes before Nico Abatayo and Issa Gaye went back-to-back to put the finishing touches in NUs return to the win column.In the end, Gaye towered above all for 22 points, six rebounds, and six blocks while Matt Salem also made an impact with a 22-point, 10-rebound double-double.With those two in complete command, J-Jay Alejandro didnt even need to do much scoring and had an all-around 10 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists.Though the Bulldogs remain at the sixth spot, they now stand just right behind fifth-running and 4-5 University of the Philippines and fourth-running and 5-5 Far Eastern University.On the other hand, with their 10th loss to start the season, UST is the first team to be eliminated.Steve Akomo showed the way for them with 16 points and 12 rebounds.BOX SCORESNU 91  Gaye 22, Salem 22, Alejandro 10, Abatayo 10, Joson 7, Mosqueda 5, Bartlett 5, Yu 5, Diputado 3, Aquino 2, Tibayan 0, Morido 0, Cauilan 0UST 83  Akomo 16, Lee 15, De Guzman 14, Caunan 11, Faundo 8, Sta.

Alvin Pasaol made quick work of each and every body UP threw at him.From the get-go, it was apparent that Alvin Pasaol was playing on a level way above everybody else on Sunday at the Filoil Flying V Centre.It didnt take long for the rest of University of the East to join him there as they piled onto the woes of fast fading University of the Philippines, 73-64, for their third win in the last four games in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.The second-year sensation had nine points just in the first eight minutes as he and his Red Warriors raced to a 21-8 start.Of course, State U would battle back and even snatched away a 47-46 lead late in the third before Pasaol had all but three points in the 9-1 counter that re-established a 57-48 edge in favor of his team.Juan and Javi Gomez de Liano again pulled the Maroons to as close as 62-68 inside the last two minutes only to see the UEs burly forward again turn them back with an inside basket and a bonus.That would be more than enough for UE to improve to 3-7 in the standings  still well and alive for the Final Four. You know, habang may buhay, may pag-asa. Until there are four teams that make it, we still have a shot, a beaming head coach Derrick Pumaren said.Pasaol wound up with 32 points, 13 rebounds, and two steals while Mark Olayon also contributed an 11-point, 10-rebound double-double.The offense was unstoppable, but so was the defense as the Red Warriors frustrated the Cebuano connection of Paul Desiderio and Jun Manzo to only a combined 15 points in 6-of-29 shooting and Malian reinforcement Ibrahim Ouattara to only two points and five fouls.We did a great job defensively. We had three guys na we just had to make sure to contain, Pumaren said. It was a great effort for all of the guys.In fact, by his lonesome, Pasaol outscored UPs entire starting lineup bannered by Desiderio, Manzo, and Ouattara, 32-17.With their main men struggling, Juan GDL did his all with a career-high 22 points on top of eight rebounds, three assists, and three steals while brother Javi chipped in a 17-point, 11-rebound double-double.After their biggest win in over a season, they have now lost five of the last six.

Ricci Rivero teamed up with Ben Mbala and DLSU's other big men as DLSU overpowered UE.There wasnt going to be another record-setting day at the expense of De La Salle University in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.Ben Mbala made sure of that and showed the way at both ends as the Green Archers turned down the hype on Alvin Pasaol-led University of the East, 99-78, on Wednesday at the MOA Arena.The last time the two teams met, Pasaol dropped a milestone mark 49 points on the defending champions.That wasnt going to happen again in this one as Mbala, all six-feet eight-inches of him, was all over the King Warrior.Pasaol still had 23 points, but had to work for each and every shot he put up as he shot 8-of-19 from the field and turned the ball over five times.At the other end, the Cameroonian powerhouse imposed his will and pounded in 12 of his 25 points in the first half.Ricci Rivero and Aljun Melecio were right there with him as DLSU blitzed their way onto a 14-4 start in the first four minutes.They wouldnt relinquish both the momentum and the lead for the remainder of the game.Rivero wound up with 13 points, six rebounds, four steals, and three assists while Melecio, still working his way back from a battle with dengue, had seven markers and three dimes of his own.Also helping the cause were big men Santi Santillan who continued to open eyes with a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double and Justine Baltazar who had 13 points, three rebounds, and three blocks.With the win, their ninth in 11 game, the Taft-based team is now assured of making it into the next round.Mark Olayon was the only other UE player in double-digits with 18 points on top of seven assists.Without the same sort of firepower, however, they have been pushed to the brink of elimination now at 3-8 in the standings.BOX SCORESDLSU 99  Mbala 25, Santillan 14, Rivero R 13, Baltazar 13, Melecio 7, Tratter 6, Montalbo 5, Rivero P 4, Caracut 3, Go 3, Gonzales 3, Paraiso 2, Tero 1, Capacio 0UE 78  Pasaol 23, Olayon 18, Derige 9, Varilla 8, Maloles 6, Acuno 6, Cullar 4, Bartolome 2, Cruz 2, Manalang 0, Conner 0, Gagate 0QUARTER SCORES: 28-18, 53-34, 77-55, 99-78---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

    "text": "UAAP Adamson dodges upset ax from winless USTJUST BARELY. Jerrick Ahanmisi saved Adamson from disaster against winless UST.Adamson University was this close to becoming the very first victim of University of Sto. Tomas in the UAAP 80 Men's Basketball Tournament.Jerrick Ahanmisi wasn't going to let that happen, however, and scored three points in the 7-2 run in the last two minutes that allowed the Soaring Falcons to escape the tamed Tigers, 75-70, on Wednesday at the MOA Arena.The playoff hopefuls from San Marcelino were under siege all game long by Espana's winless team. Were lucky we survived this game. We flirted with disaster because probably, (our boys) mentality is theyre playing a winless team and its gonna be easy sailing for us, head coach Franz Pumaren said.What was expected to be a mismatch turned into a close contest that saw 16 lead changes and seven deadlocks.That was still the case in the endgame as Jeepy Faundo tied the tally for UST at 66-all with 1:56 remaining before the sophomore sharpshooter and Papi Sarr connived for the 7-2 run that granted a 73-68 advantage to Adamson.Carlo Escalambre dropped a long-range bomb to keep the Tigers coming at 71-73 with 14 ticks to go only to see Ahanmisi make good on a couple more charities to keep them at bay once and for all.In the end, the Filipino-American scored a game-high 21 points and was backstopped by their Cameroonian powerhouse who had a 12-point, 14-rebound double-double.It was a much-wanted win for the Soaring Falcons who are coming off a sorry loss to defending champion De La Salle University. This particular game is just part and parcel of our learning process of being a young team, Pumaren said.On the other hand, it was another sorry loss for UST which has now lost 14 in a row dating back to a year ago.Reggie Boy Basibas topped the scoring column for them with 17 points which were still far from enough from preventing their fall to a still bottom-feeding 0-11.BOX SCORESADAMSON 75  Ahanmisi 21, Sarr 12, Pingoy 7, Ochea 7, Espeleta 6, Manganti 5, Lojera 5, Camacho 4, Manalang 3, Mustre 3, Hill 2, Bernardo 0, Zaldivar 0, Chua 0UST 70  Basibas 17, Faundo 12, Akomo 10, De Guzman 9, Escalambre 8, Sta.

    "text": "UAAP Ateneo climbs to 11-0, claims twice-to-beat advantageGO TO WORK. Ateneo is now three wins away from sweeping the elimination round.It was just another day in the office for Ateneo de Manila University on Saturday at the MOA Arena.And working like they have done throughout the tournament, the Blue Eagles had no problems whatsoever up against University of the East for a convincing 97-73 victory.The decision gave the Katipunan-based squad its 11th win in as many games in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament. Were happy to get this one under our belt. Every game is a step forward forward for our team, coach Tab Baldwin said.It also gave them the first of two playoff incentives  if there is to be a Final Four.After a tight first quarter and a half, Thirdy Ravena poured in five points, two rebounds, and two assists in a 15-4 rush that increased a five-point edge into a 47-31 advantage.The lead would only go as high as 31 in the final frame.Four Blue Eagles were in double-digits led by Ravena who wound up with 17 points on top of eight rebounds and four assists. Vince Tolentino and Raffy Verano also chipped in 12 points apiece.Their depth was much evident yet again as their bench buried their counterparts, 50-23.It wasnt just on offense that the league-leaders dominated, however as they held King Warrior Alvin Pasaol to a season-low eight points in 2-of-11 shooting from the field.The second-year sensation had been averaging 22 points coming into the contest and famously dropped a milestone mark 49 points on De La Salle University.Now, Ateneo is three wins away from sweeping the elimination round and, therefore, automatically advancing into the Finals. If thats the case, they will have no use for the twice-to-beat advantage they have just won.With two of their last three assignments coming against teams at the bottom half of the standings, that is very much a possibility. However, Baldwins sights remain on continuing to get better as he said, A lot to be pleased, but still a lot to improve on.On the other hand, one more loss will eliminate 3-9 UE from contention.In lieu of Pasaol, it was Mark Maloles and Mark Olayon who topped the scoring column for them with 20 and 15 points, respectively.BOX SCORESATENEO 97 - Ravena 17, Mendoza 13, Tolentino 12, Verano 12, Asistio 9, Porter 9, Nieto Mi. 7, Ikeh 7, Mamuyac 3, Nieto Ma. 2, Go 2, Black 2, Andrade 2, Tio 0, White 0.UE 73 - Maloles 20, Olayon 15, Pasaol 8, Bartolome 7, Cullar 5, Varilla 5, Acuno 4, Derige 4, Manalang 3, Conner 2, Cruz 0, Toribio 0.QUARTER SCORES: 21-18, 48-35, 71-52, 97-73---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

    "text": "UAAP UP comes back from the dead to stun FEU, stay in contentionNOT TODAY. Make that two game-winning triples for Paul Desiderio just in this UAAP 80 Men's Basketball Tournament.With five losses in the last six games, the University of the Philippines looked like they were already dead in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.And with only five points for all of the third quarter on Saturday at the MOA Arena, they looked like they were already dead against Far Eastern University.Team captain Paul Desiderio and first-year players Ibrahim Ouattara and Juan Gomez de Liano had other plans, however, and willed the Fighting Maroons from 12 points down in the last nine minutes to an unbelievable 59-56 comeback triumph over the Tamaraws.It was yet again Desiderio who came through in the clutch, burying the game-winning triple over the outstretched arms of old foe Ron Dennison. Paul made sure na babawi siya kay Dennison, head coach Bo Perasol said of his main manThat main man wound up with 15 points and only made good on 6-of-23 from the field, but made good in the biggest shot in the game.However, he wouldnt have had that chance if not for the effort of Ouattara and Gomez de Liano who merged for 10 points and a whole lot of hustle in the 19-4 run that erased a 12-point deficit early in the final frame and erected a 56-53 State U lead with 38 ticks to go on the clock.In the ensuing possession, Jasper Parker buried a big-time triple for FEU to tie the tally at 56-all with 32.9 seconds remaining.After the two teams traded defensive stops, Perasol put the ball in the hands of their main man and he did nothing but come through. Asked what was going through his mind then, he answered, Di ko masabi e. Nasa isip ko lang na panalo o tabla.In the end, Ouattara posted a 10-point, 15-rebound double-double; Gomez de Liano contributed seven points, five rebounds, two steals, and one assist; and Jun Manzo chipped in seven points, five rebounds, and four assists.The unbelievable comeback grants UP a much-needed win that raises their record to 5-6. Struggling for all of the second round of the eliminations, they are now on even ground with the Tamaraws for the fourth spot.It looked like that wasnt meant to be as down by seven at the half, the Tamaraws flipped the script in the third and shut down the Fighting Maroons who were only able to muster five points in 2-of-21 shooting.At the other end, Arvin Tolentino caught fire and scored half of their 22 points in the quarter for a 47-37 lead in their favor entering the final frame.The flame died out on FEU in the last nine minutes, however, as they lost for the third time in the last four games. Parker and Tolentino topped the scoring column for them with 13 and 12 points, respectively.They remain in fourth-place, but also have State U beside them.

    "text": "UAAP Green Archers give tamed Tigers another brutal beatingNO QUESTION. Ben Mbala and Ricci Rivero only played 19 minutes, yet DLSU still won by 35 points against UST.Ever since head coach Aldin Ayo took over, De La Salle University has destroyed University of Sto. Tomas by an average of 36.7 points.Now in the second round of the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament, the Green Archers have kept that winning margin intact.Burying the Tigers in a 25-8 second quarter, the defending champions waltzed their way into a 35-point laugher of a win, 94-59, on Sunday at the MOA Arena.Last season, the Taft-based team dropped a 29-point hammer on UST in the first round and then crushed them by 43 points in the second round.And in the two teams first round meeting this season, DLSU walloped the boys from Espana by 38 points.It was clear from the get-go that was still going to be the case in this one as Ricci Riveros back-to-back baskets and bonuses punctuated a 14-0 run that increased a four-point lead into a 38-20 advantage.From there, the Green Archers still showed no mercy and even ran up the score to 85-43 in the final frame.By then, all of Rivero, Andrei Caracut, Ben Mbala, Aljun Melecio, and Kib Montalbo did not see much action and were already resting on the bench.Rivero wound up with 16 points, seven rebounds, three assists, and two steals in just 19 minutes while Mbala had 17 markers, nine boards, and three blocks in the same time on the floor.Jollo Go also made the most of his extended minutes and poured in 12 points all on triples.The 35-point win was the defending champions fifth in a row and 10th overall in 12 games.With another win, or a loss by Adamson University in its own matchup later, they will seize the second twice-to-beat advantage.On the other hand, the worst season in school history continues for UST which is yet to win in 12 games.This, despite the best efforts of Marvin Lee who had 25 points on top of eight rebounds in this one.With their last two games coming against still undefeated Ateneo de Manila University and now confident University of the East, a winless season for the once proud Tigers remains a possibility.BOX SCORESDLSU 94  Mbala 17, Rivero R 16, Go 12, Rivero P 10, Tratter 8, Caracut 7, Melecio 6, Santillan 6, Capacio 5, Baltazar 4, Montalbo 2, Paraiso 1, Tero 0, Gonzales 0UST 59  Lee 25, Akomo 14, Sta.

Adamson is so close to a playoff berth that it could already taste it.Adamson University needs one more win to book a ticket for the next round of the UAAP 80 Men's Basketball Tournament.More than that, they remain in the running for a playoff incentive.The Soaring Falcons stayed within striking distance of second-running De La Salle University after pouncing on listless National University, 90-77, on Sunday at the MOA Arena.Franz Pumaren's boys blitzed to a scorching start of 21-5 and never trailed. People will tend to notice our shooting, but we put more emphasis on defense. Hopefully, we can sustain it, the head coach said.In the first half alone, Jerrick Ahanmisi, Jonathan Espeleta, and Rob Manalang each had 11 points to almost match the output of their opponents who only mustered 35.Revrev Diputado and J-Jay Alejandro jolted some life to the Bulldogs and pulled them to within 77-86 with under a minute remaining, but free throws from Ahanmisi and Koko Pingoy kept them at bay once and for all.In the end, Ahanmisi and Espeleta both scored 16 points and shot four triples. Manalang also added 14 points while Papi Sarr posted a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double.Now with back-to-back wins, Adamson improved to 8-4  behind the 10-2 Green Archers who are in the lead for the remaining twice-to-beat advantage.Still, Pumaren said their focus is on their remaining assignments up against fellow playoff hopefuls University of the Philippines and Far Eastern University. Right now, our focus is just to win the next two games. We just want to enter the Final Four on a winning note, he said.The climb gets steeper for NU which dropped to 4-7.

Thirdy Ravena had 20, Matt Nieto had 19, and eight other Ateneo players chipped in somewhere between six to eight points.Thirdy Ravena and Matt Nieto got Ateneo de Manila University off to a strong start on Saturday at the Araneta Coliseum, but it was the reserves who ultimately towed them past University of Sto. Tomas.Ravena flirted with a triple-double, Nieto stroked the nets, and the rest of the Blue Eagles did their part to overwhelm the tamed Tigers, 102-83, and hike their record to 12-0, still tops in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.UST, now winless through 13 tries, actually showed much sense of urgency early on and actually had a two-point lead in the second. We expected that theyd give it their best no matter the situation in the standings. Its a good thing the players responded to the challenge, coach Sandy Arespacochaga said.It was at that point, however, that Ravena and Nieto connived for all but three points in an 11-0 answer that gave back the lead to Ateneo, 44-35, late in the quarter.The Tigers again threatened early in the final frame, just down 70-75, only to see Mike Nieto and Isaac Gos back-to-back hits re-increase the Blue Eagle advantage to 79-70 inside the last six minutes.Ateneo would not let their opponents any closer from there as Ravena even had a thunderous throwdown with 2:18 remaining to put the exclamation mark on their win. Good thing in the fourth that we played well defensively, Arespacochaga said.In the end, the do-it-all forward had 20 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, and two steals to his name.Matt Nieto contributed 19 points built on five triples on top of three assists while eight other teammates chipped in somewhere between six to eight points.Now, the league-leaders are two wins away from a sweep of the elimination round.Conversely, the once proud boys from Espana are just one loss away from a winless season.Dating back to a year ago, they have now lost 16 in a row.Oliver De Guzman topped the scoring column for them in this one with 19 points.BOX SCORESATENEO 102  Ravena 20, Nieto Ma 19, Mamuyac 8, Go 7, Nieto Mi 7, Tio 7, Mallillin 7, Verano 6, Asistio 6, Black 6, Ikeh 5, Tolentino 4, Porter 0, Andrade 0, White 0UST 83  De Guzman 19, Sta.

Ben Mbala was no match for NU.There was no shootout between De La Salle University and National University on Saturday at the Araneta Coliseum.Instead, the defending champion Green Archers outclassed the upstart Bulldogs, 101-76, for their sixth consecutive victory on the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.Ben Mbala remained a force with 30 points and eight rebounds to carry his team to 11-2  assured of a twice-to-beat advantage and still in the running for the top spot.It was also the reigning MVP who did the heavy lifting in the 23-9 blast that boosted DLSU from a slight two-point margin late in the first to a big 43-27 advantage in the middle of the second.They would never be threatened the rest of the way.The last time the two teams met, the Green Archers turned back the good fight put up by the Bulldogs, 115-110.There wasnt going to be a close contest in this one as the defending champions led by double-digits for most of the matchup.Ricci Rivero was yet again right there to provide backup for Mbala with 16 points, six rebounds, and two assists.The rest of DLSUs key cogs didnt even have to score much as they were already resting in the endgame.The easy win was much welcome for them as they now turn their attention to a rematch with archrival Ateneo de Manila University to end the eliminations.On the other hand, NU goes back to the drawing board, now needing to win out in its remaining games to give itself a chance at the playoffs.

FEU is now alone at fourth while also eliminating one of the teams pursuing them for that spot.Far Eastern University has not been playing its best basketball as of late in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.A gritty 79-63 victory versus very game University of the East on Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum, however, just might be the boost the Tamaraws need for their playoff push.Under siege by the Red Warriors who were desperate for a win, the boys from Morayta leaned on the hustle of Richard Escoto, Prince Orizu, and Ron Dennison to pull away late. This is a good confidence-booster for us going into the homestretch, head coach Olsen Racela said.With the two teams still going at it in the final frame, those three teamed up for the 11-4 charge that increased a two-point lead into a 66-57 advantage in their favor with under four minutes remaining. Im just proud of the way we played in the second half, he said.Three of five makes from that run came off of offensive rebounds.Following another defensive stop, Arvin Tolentino then put the game away for good for FEU with a four-point play.Not long after, they were celebrating their return to solo fourth now at 6-6.This is a much-welcome development after having lost five of their last six.Orizu turned in his best game of the season with a 14-point, 13-rebound double-double to go along with two blocks while Tolentino and Dennison combined for 18 points, 15 rebounds, five assists, and five steals.First-year point guard Jasper Parker also shined with a UAAP career-best 18 points on top of eight assists. Kasi si (Jasper) naman, its not about his scoring, but the way he orchestrates everything for us. The scoring, parang bonus na lang sa akin yun, Racela said.The Tamaraws will be able to get a tighter grip on solo fourth depending on the result of the matchup between 5-6 University of the Philippines and 8-4 Adamson University.For UE, Alvin Pasaol topscored with 19 points, but shot 32 percent from the field and turned the ball over eight times.Running out of gas in the endgame, they bow out of contention with a 3-10 record.

Papi Sarr and Adamson did not give UP any chance whatsoever to fight back.Adamson University stymied the University of the Philippines in the third quarter on Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum.And in the final frame, the Soaring Falcons didnt give the Maroons any chance whatsoever to fight back.Papi Sarr overpowered anybody threw at him, Jerie Pingoy masterfully orchestrated the offense, and Adamson bullied its way right through UP, 86-70, and officially onto the playoff stage of the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.For the second straight season, Franz Pumaren has brought to San Marcelino a taste of the playoffs. I guess we already exceeded last years performance. Were ahead by one game going to the last game of eliminations  thats an improvement already, the head coach said, referring to their 8-6 record a year ago.Already leading by eight at the half, Adamson went on a 21-6 tear to put up a massive 60-37 lead at the 3:35 mark of the third.Still, State U had high hopes for a comeback as in their last outing, they only scored five points in the third before rallying all the way to a win.Indeed, Paul Desiderio willed his team back to within 66-74 with five minutes remaining. If you notice, during that time, I didnt call a timeout. For me, thats one way of trusting my players, one way of making them feel that they should rise above the challenge, Pumaren said.Respond, the Soaring Falcons did as Pingoys assist to a Jerrick Ahanmisi fastbreak layup sparked their 12-0 kick to close the contest.In the end, Sarr had a power performance of 25 points and 17 rebounds while Pingoy had an all-around 15 points, eight assists, six steals, and four rebounds.Jerrick Ahanmisi and Rob Manalang chipped in 11 and 10 points, respectively, as Adamson locked itself into the third-seed.In doing so, they also gave UP a tougher time of making the playoffs.Despite Desiderios 20 points, five rebounds, two assists, and two steals, they now stand at 5-7  a full game behind fourth-running 6-6 Far Eastern University.BOX SCORESADAMSON 86  Sarr 25, Pingoy 15, Ahanmisi 11, Manalang 10, Espeleta 8, Manganti 5, Ochea 4, Hill 4, Camacho 4, Lojera 0, Mustre 0, Bernardo 0, Paranada 0UP 70  Desiderio 20, Manzo 15, Gomez de Liano 10, Vito 6, Lim 4, Dario 3, Jaboneta 3, Webb 3, Ouattara 2, Romero 2, Lao 2, Harris 0, Prado 0QUARTER SCORES: 18-17, 39-31, 69-50, 86-70---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

J-Jay Alejandro was not letting today be the last day of contention for NU.National University was at the receiving end of torrid shooting from Far Eastern University on Wednesday at the Araneta Coliseum.None of that mattered, however, for J-Jay Alejandro.Scorching the nets with 11 points in the final frame, the team captain willed his Bulldogs right through the red-hot Tamaraws, 87-84, to stay alive in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.The Sampaloc-based squad needed a win to keep contending. This is the dream. This is what I was expecting from our players. I hope its not too late, I hope its not too late, head coach Jamike Jarin said.Alejandro gave them that and more, taking over in the endgame with half of the points in the 22-2 run that erased a 15-point deficit and erected an 86-81 advantage with 2:51 remaining. We never bowed down. Im happy right now because I saw the maturity, their mentor said.Ron Dennison buried a triple to pull FEU to within 84-86 with under two minutes remaining, but NU wouldnt let them come any closer.With possession in the hands of the Tamaraws in the last 13 seconds, Wendell Comboy threw up an errant inbound to the hands of Enzo Joson.Not long after, the first-year player split his free throws to seal the deal in the Bulldogs come-from-behind win. He wound up with 13 points, four rebounds, and one game-sealing interception.Issa Gaye also provided a big boost with 24 points, 11 rebounds, and two blocks while Chino Mosqueda and Jonas Tibayan chipped in eight and seven points, respectively.Those contributions were more than enough to offset FEUs torrid shooting that totaled 18 triples  tops in league history.Still, it was Alejandro who saved the day, and the season, for NU as he also had nine assists and six rebounds to his name. J-Jay demanded for the ball and we gave him the ball. He made the right decisions so hats off to him, but it was a total team effort, Jarin said.Now at 5-8, they are nipping at the heels of fourth-running and 6-7 FEU and fifth-running and 5-7 University of the Philippines.For the Tamaraws, Arvin Tolentino and Ron Dennison each had 21 points under their belts.BOX SCORESNU 87  Gaye 24, Alejandro 17, Joson 13, Mosqueda 8, Tibayan 7, Abatayo 6, Aquino 5, Diputado 4, Yu 2, Cauilan 1, Bartlett 0, Morido 0, Salem 0, Rangel 0, Lastimosa 0FEU 84  Tolentino 21, Dennison 21, Comboy 16, Cani 14, Inigo 3, Tuffin 3, Ebona 2, Escoto 2, Orizu 2, Parker 0, Trinidad 0QUARTER SCORES: 19-27, 39-47, 64-72, 87-84---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Ateneo took UP's best shot and still came out on top.All was going right for the University of the Philippines on Wednesday at the Araneta Coliseum.And then Ateneo de Manila University finally imposed its will.With Matt Nieto making shots on offense and altering shots on defense in the final frame, the Blue Eagles came from behind to frustrate the desperate Fighting Maroons, 96-82.With their latest convincing victory, they kept their slate spotless through 13 games in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament.UP was in command for majority of the matchup until Ateneo rediscovered its winning form. Certainly a lot of fight in UP in this game. They showed their heart and towards the end of the third and then the fourth, our players showed a lot of character, coach Sandy Arespacochaga said.Clinging onto a two-point lead with three minutes remaining, Nietos booming triple detonated their 13-1 run to close the contest.Four different players contributed in that decisive run. It was a tough game, a challenging game, and were happy that the character of our players certainly showed, Arespacochaga said.The breaks of the game also favored the Blue Eagles.With State U going on an 11-0 run to tie the tally at 79-all with 4:19 remaining, Jolo Mendoza was pressured in the backcourt, but was able to get a foul from Jun Manzo.Replays, however, showed that Mendoza was in the backcourt for nine seconds and could have also been called for an eight-second backcourt violation.As UP was already in the penalty, Mendoza was instead granted two free throws and made both. From there, both the lead and the momentum stayed with Ateneo.In the end, Nieto had 19 points on top of four rebounds and two assists while Isaac Go and Gian Mamuyac contributed 13 markers apiece.That more than made up for the off day of Thirdy Ravena who had 10 points in 2-of-11 shooting on top of nine rebounds, six assists, and four steals.That also more than made up for State Us strong shooting which counted 11 makes from deep.Now, the Blue Eagles turn their attention to a rivalry game with De La Salle University on Sunday. Another win there will complete for them a sweep of the elimination round.On the other hand, the Fighting Maroons go back to the drawing board as their effort fell short.With National Universitys win against Far Eastern University earlier, a win could have vaulted UP onto a share of fourth.Now at 5-8, they are tied with the Bulldogs.To make the playoffs, they will need to beat NU on Saturday and hope that FEU loses to Adamson University on the same day.BOX SCORESATENEO 96  Nieto Ma 19, Go 13, Mamuyac 13, Ravena 10, Tolentino 10, Nieto Mi 9, Verano 8, Ikeh 6, Asistio 4, Mendoza 4, Tio 0, Black 0UP 82  Gomez de Liano Ju 21, Desiderio 16, Manzo 13, Dario 8, Gomez de Liano Ja 7, Lim 4, Ouattara 3, Jaboneta 3, Webb 2, Romero 2, Lao 2, Prado 1, Vito 0, Ricafort 0, Harris 0QUARTER SCORES: 22-23, 42-48, 63-64, 96-82---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Their mindset is theyre not willing to go to vacation, a proud head coach Bo Perasol said post-game.The two teams, both at 5-8 coming into the contest, were fighting for the right to remain in contention.That determination was very much evident in the Desiderio who had 11 points in his teams big 34-point opening salvo.Behind their captain, UP raced to an 8-5 start and then a 58-41 advantage at the half.By then, they counted three players in double-digits including Desiderio with 21 as well as Gomez de Liano brothers Juan and Javi with 13 and 11, respectively.The King Maroon kept hot in the third and added nine more points, including a booming three to end the quarter.His team had a massive 84-60 lead at that point and would not look back all the way to a 6-8 finish to the elimination round.Five players wound up in double-digits with Juan GDL having 22 points on top of 13 rebounds, four assists, and one steal while Javi GDL had his own 17-point, 10-rebound double-double.Ibrahim Ouattara also added 12 points and 13 rebounds while Jun Manzo chipped in 14 points, five assists, and three steals.Without a doubt, it was a total team effort for State U as even Andrew Harris, Rob Ricafort, and Paolo Romero contributed two points. All three are graduating players.Sabi ko kay Paolo, ibibigay ko sa kanilang apat yung panalo, Desiderio expressed.UPs win, however, will not mean anything if the 6-7 Tamaraws manage to upend third-seed Adamson University in the ongoing game.For the Bulldogs, Issa Gaye showed the way with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and three blocks.Their campaign comes to a close, however, with a 5-9 standing. Team captain J-Jay Alejandro punctuated his fantastic farewell year with 16 points, eight assists, four rebounds, and two blocks in this one.Co-captain and fellow graduating player Matt Salem had seven points and seven rebounds.BOX SCORESUP 106  Desiderio 30, Gomez de Liano Ju 22, Gomez de Liano Ja 17, Manzo 14, Ouattara 12, Webb 3, Lim 2, Harris 2, Ricafort 2, Romero 2, Prado 0, Jaboneta 0NU 81  Gaye 25, Alejandro 16, Joson 7, Salem 7, Tibayan 7, Mosqueda 4, Bartlett 4, Diputado 3, Cauilan 3, Aquino 3, Morido 2, Yu 0, Abatayo 0, Lastimosa 0, Flores 0, Rangel 0QUARTER SCORES: 34-21, 58-45, 84-60, 106-81---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Of course, natutuwa kami. I have to hand it to the players kasi they never gave up, never wavered sa kagustuhang mag-Final Four, head coach Olsen Racela said.With the win, they also effectively extinguished the playoff hopes of the University of the Philippines.A loss would have forced FEU into a knockout bout for the fourth-seed up against the Fighting Maroons.They werent going to let that happen, however, as each and every one of Racelas boys were laser-focused.It also didnt hurt the Tamaraws chances that Jerrick Ahanmisi left the game in the second quarter due to an ankle sprain.When the Soaring Falcons again came as close as 46-52 early in the final frame, they then lost Koko Pingoy also due to an ankle sprain.FEU would only take advantage and rode a 19-8 run to close the contest.No single player stood out, but Racela welcomed a total team effort fronted by Arvin Tolentino who had 14 points and five rebounds and Richard Escoto who had 11 markers and eight boards.Prince Orizu also made his presence felt with a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double all while shutting down counterpart Papi Sarr who only had 10 points in 33 percent shooting.The Tamaraws are back in the Final Four as the fourth-seed, but are yet to know who theyre facing.

Steve Akomo and UST have always had what it takes and all finally came together in their last assignment in the season.The UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament did not go as planned for University of Sto. Tomas.Still, the proud program wasnt going winless.Reggie Boy Basibas, Steve Akomo, and Marvin Lee made sure of that as the Tigers finally growled for the first time in the season and clawed University of the East for an 88-85 decision on Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum.Coming into the contest, one of the winningest schools in the league had dropped each and every one of their first 13 assignments.And so, faced with the prospect of making history in the wrong way, UST showed what its capable of at long last.Even as the Red Warriors came as close as 79-80, lady luck still looked like she was favoring the Tigers as Lee made good on a banked shot and Basibas steal led to a split from the stripe for an 84-79 advantage in their favor.UE again wielded its vaunted full court press and pulled to within 85-85 only to see Oliver De Guzman convert his couple of charities and Alvin Pasaol fail to get a shot up.Not long after, the boys from Espana were celebrating their long-awaited and much-wanted first win. Siyempre, masaya kasi hindi kami na-zero, head coach Boy Sablan said post-game.Basibas wound up with 21 points, 12 coming in the final frame, on top of nine rebounds, four assists, and three steals. Akomo had 18 points, 20 rebounds, and six blocks while Enric Caunan posted his own 14-point, 11-rebound double-double.Lee also chipped in six of his 11 points in the payoff period.A 1-13 record is far from what UST has been used to, but it still wasnt the winless season just about everybody was talking about. Part ng rebuilding process namin to. Sana magtuloy-tuloy na, Sablan said.For UE, Pasaol topped the scoring column with 18 points, but only had three in the fourth.

Ben Mbala and DLSU ensured that no one will be automatically advancing into the Finals and there will be a Final Four.De La Salle University was down by seven with 2:21 remaining on Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum.Ben Mbala and Kib Montalbo werent letting that be the end of their elimination round in the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament, however.The reigning and defending MVP was a force all throughout while the team captain made all the big plays in the endgame as the Green Archers took down erstwhile undefeated Ateneo de Manila University, 79-76.With the come-from-behind win, DLSU puts the first blemish on the erstwhile spotless slate of their archrivals. Big win. I have to commend the players for their effort and for sticking to the game plan especially during the endgame, head coach Aldin Ayo, appearing in his first post-win interview in a while, said.Much of it was because of Mbala who was all over the floor with 28 points, 19 rebounds, six blocks, and six steals and Montalbo who only had six points, three rebounds, and three assists but steadied the ship in the endgame.Everything was going right for the Blue Eagles as even a helter-skelter sequence had the ball ending up in the hands of Vince Tolentino for a 76-69 lead with 2:21 remaining.That would be their last basket, however, as the Green Archers were finally able to enforce their mayhem and caused three straight errors from their opponents which led to six straight points.Still, they were down by one with under a minute left before Montalbo spun around and sunk a floater that proved to be a go-ahead basket for a 77-76 advantage for his team.After another defensive stop, it was again the Taft-based teams captain who collared the rebound.DLSU was unable to take advantage, but neither was Ateneo as Isaac Go was bothered by Mbala just enough to botch a short stab. We got lucky in the endgame, especially Isaac Gos semi-hook. Luckily, it did not go in, Ayo said.Not long after, Ricci Riveros free throws and block on Anton Asistios would have been game-tying three put the finishing touches on an unbelievable comeback. He wound up with 21 points, five rebounds, two steals, and one block.That unbelievable comeback raised the record of the Green Archers to 12-2 at the end of eliminations.With that, they ensured that no one will be automatically advancing into the Finals and there will be a Final Four.There, second-seed DLSU will face off against third-seed Adamson University while top-seed Ateneo will wage war with fourth-seed Atene de Manila University. The archrivals both have a twice-to-beat advantage.The Blue Eagles were led in this one by Thirdy Ravena who had 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals, and one block.Matt Nieto chipped in 12 points while Go had 13 points, six rebounds, and five assists.Unable to close out the contest, however, they will have to try another time to make it through to the Finals.BOX SCORESDLSU 79  Mbala 28, Rivero R 21, Tratter 8, Santillan 7, Melecio 6, Montalbo 6, Go 3, Caracut 0, Rivero P 0, Baltazar 0, Paraiso 0ATENEO 76  Ravena 15, Go 13, Nieto Ma 12, Verano 9, Mendoza 7, Asistio 6, Tolentino 6, Ikeh 4, Porter 3, Nieto Mi 1, Mamuyac 0, Black 0QUARTER SCORES: 17-22, 37-35, 54-63, 79-76---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

They were up noong end game, but we were able to get the win, so for sure it will be difficult for us. We're going to prepare against them, Ayo said after the game.Although they would still have enjoyed a twice-to-beat advantage in a hypothetical Final Four match against the winner of an Adamson-FEU tussle, the very essence of the most famous collegiate rivalry in the country was enough to inspire them to victory, ending Ateneos 13-game winning streak in a 79-76 thriller.But since [the game is between] La Salle and Ateneo, we're not going to back down, we're not going to hold back. We're just going to compete.UAAP MVP Ben Mbala seconded his coach, and added that they will not back down from any physical play against any opponent.We just wanted to win. We didn't quit. Coach told us, never give up. We kept pushing and we just gave our everything and we left the rest to God, and it was able to help us win the game, Mbala told reporters in a post-game interview.The 6-foot-7 slotman also mentioned that the team needs to play as hard as ever, and may even seek divine intervention to help them book a Finals berth against either Ateneo or FEU.The Final Four match between De La Salle and Adamson will be on Saturday, Nov. 18, at the Araneta Coliseum.--follow this writer on Twitter, @philipptionary.",

    "text": "UAAP For three years, Pasaol played basketball to earn for his familyGAME-WINNER, BREADWINNER. Alvin Pasaol has come a long way from playing in commercial leagues in Davao.Alvin Pasaol is very close with head coach Derrick PumarenAside from being the main man for University of the East, Pasaol is also, apparently, the inspiration for Pumarens newfound fashion sense in the season.All this is rooted in a relationship that began as intimately as possible as once upon a time, manong went out of his way to recruit his future main man.As it turns out, however, that relationship wouldnt have begun if Pasaol didnt impress somebody else first. Yung import namin sa commercial league sa Davao, si Charles Mammie. Kinontact niya si manong at sinabi na parang, Manong, may bata rito, ganito, ganyan. Baka gusto mong i-try para sa UE, he recalled.Mammie once played under Pumaren for the Red Warriors.Asked what he thinks the Sierra Leone native saw in him then, Pasaol answered, Siguro, the way lang ako maglaro. Kung ano yung laro ko rito, ganun din kasi laro ko doon.And so, manong heeded the call of Mammie and flew to Davao.Still, that personal appearance was no guarantee for a commitment as many others were also eyeing the now 22-year-old. Marami akong option nun, di lang si manong, he shared, before saying that Arellano University and Colegio de San Juan de Letran, among others, also expressed interest in him before.UEs trump card, however, was the very man who flew all the way to Francis Bangoy International Airport. Na-impress ako agad kay manong kasi siyempre, sikat na coach. Tapos yung mga teams niya dati, napanood din ng tatay ko, the prized prospect said.Even then, Pumaren knew the best way to get to Pasaol. Pagpunta niya ng Davao, nag-eat all you can kami, the latter said through chuckles.That particular meal could have very well been a celebratory dinner for a youngster who worked and worked and worked before the right opportunity finally came along.Before the offer to suit up for the Red Warriors, the Davaoeno played in commercial leagues to help his family. Three years po bago ako mag-UE, puro basketball lang talaga ako. Sumali ako sa Gold Star (his commercial team) nung 16-years-old ako tapos nag-earn ako ng pera para sa pamilya ko, he said.Pasaol decided to help out in their family finances as his father, a driver, didnt earn enough for their family of four.And just so he could do that, he had to sacrifice his studies. Nag-first year college na ako tapos varsity rin ako dun, pero nag-stop ako pagkatapos naming mag-champion. Di ako nagpatuloy ng pag-aaral kasi di namin kinaya, he said.He then continued, Nag-focus na lang ako sa basketball. Okay lang naman sanang mag-aral pa ako kasi may scholarships naman, pero gusto ko munang tulungan pamilya ko.So there in the commercial leagues, he made money to make ends meet. Kahit konti, nakatulong naman ako sa pangangailangan namin, he said.And there in the commercial leagues, he made his name playing against former professional players such as Leo Avenido and John Ferriols.Now, its Pasaol who is well on his way to the pros.But not before he continues carrying UE for one more year. Sobrang happy ako sa tinakbo namin ngayon, pero babawi pa kami next year, he expressed.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

That happens talaga, sometimes it doesnt go your way, said Ravena after Ateneos 76-79 loss Sunday at the Big Dome that snapped the Blue Eagles 13-game winning streak.OK lang I mean its the reality. Things dont always go your way, when it doesnt you just have to do something about it, he added.The Blue Eagles were up 76-69 with 2:21 remaining in the match before going down with a stinging dry spell that silenced the sea of blue.Ben Mbala sparked DLSUs rampage before Kib Montalbo drilled the go-ahead top of the key turnaround jumper over the outstretched hands of Anton Asistio as the Green Archers took a 77-76 lead.A good stop by DLSU on the other end followed by two free throws by Ricci Rivero with 8.9 ticks remaining in the duel stretched the gap to three.Ateneo had enough time to duplicate their 76-75 win over their archrivals in the first round.But DLSU had a different script in mind.Asistio was able to get Abu Tratter up in the air with fake on top of the arc but Rivero has there to deflect his three-point attempt as the Green Archers escaped with an all-important win.Sayang lang na sa endgame pa nangyari yun pero props to La Salle they played really good and they didnt give up, said Ravena, who led Ateneo with 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Props to Big Ben also, he came out and he looked like a man possessed. It happens you just got to bounce back.And by bouncing back, he meant by finishing the Tamaraws on Sunday and marching back to the Finals.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

    "text": "UAAP Sablans number one lesson for Tigers: Maging mabuting taoTHE GOOD GUY. Coach Boy Sablan is nothing but proud that he has instilled good manners and right conduct in UST.University of Sto. Tomas finished the UAAP 80 Mens Basketball Tournament with a 1-13 record.By far, it was the worst record in the history of one of the leagues winningest schools.Still, head coach Boy Sablan was nothing but glad that the Tigers avoided a winless season. Siyempre, masayang hindi kami na-zero, he told reporters after he and his boys salvaged an 88-85 victory versus University of the East on Saturday.And so, even with the worst record in the history of Espana, Sablan reminded everybody to refocus on the big picture. Part ito ng rebuilding process namin. Yung transition from two coaches (before) na may pinanggalingan na hindi maganda, kailangang mabago yun, he said.Before Sablan took over, UST was coming off a coaching controversy.Therefore, he had to clean up that mess before he could concentrate on the Xs and Os. Kailangan, dun mo muna umpisahan e  sa loob ng mga batang to. Hindi naman yung basketball agad kasi kailangan yung pinagdaanan ng mga to, maisaayos muna natin, he shared.He then continued, May mga problema nung nakaraan bago ako dumating e. Yun muna yung inuna ko.And so, according to Sablan, his first order of business was to teach good manners and right conduct. Ang tinuro ko sa kanilang una  maging mabuting tao. Hindi ko tinuruan tong to do bad things inside and outside the court, he said.He then continued, UST kami, may values kaming pinoprotektahan. Walang makikipag-away sa mga to.That is exactly why whatever happens, the Tigers mentor said he can rest assured that his boys will be all right. Itong mga batang to, kahit saan to makarating, maaayos na tao ito. Naglaro kami sa maraming probinsya, kahit isang away, wala kami, he said.He then continued, Bakit? E kasi yun yung gusto kong mangyari.And so, the wins on the court may have been hard to come by for UST, but their head coach believes they have had many wins off the court. Sabi ko nga, kahit 1-13 ako, alam ko namang panalo ako sa mga bata, he expressed.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Marvin Lee and UST will now celebrate their first UAAP win in 393 days.Before today, Saturday, 393 days have passed since University of Sto. Tomas last won in the UAAPThe Tigers clawed National University, 70-69, on October 15, 2016.Since then, they have lost 17 games in a row.Looking back at that luckless run, unprecedented in the history of one of the leagues winningest schools, team captain Marvin Lee remained in disbelief. Di pa rin ako makapaniwalang ganoon yung nangyari sa amin. Hanggang ngayon, di ako makapaniwala sa sarili ko, he said.That mentality is what the boys from Espana brought to their last chance at a win in Season 80. Dito sa game na to, iniisip ko na parang last game na to, parang championship to. Sa sarili ko, yun ang sinabi ko, he said.Indeed, thats exactly what Lee did, scoring six of his 11 points in the last five minutes to help UST score their first win in the season  and in over a year  on Saturday.Of course, the captain was nothing but glad that his team avoided a winless season. Siyempre, para sakin, masarap yung feeling na nanalo. Sabi nga, parang nag-champion na kami, he said.He then continued, Thank you Lord na binigay mo sakin yung hinihiling kong isa. Hiniling ko kasi na sanang wag kaming mag-0-14.Also, Lee was grateful for the Tiger faithful who made their presence felt, even though their team was once formerly winless. Thankful pa rin ako sa mga taong nagpunta rito kasi nung nagchi-cheer na sila, na-boost up ako lalo. Feeling ko, may katulong ako sa likod ko, di ako papabayaan.And though they find themselves at the bottom of the standings for the first time in a long while, the third-year guard said all of this is just part of the process. Sabi nga ni coach, rebuilding process to so yung mga nangyari sa amin, magiging aral samin, magiging inspiration namin para next season, he said.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Around this time last year, the 2006 UAAP champion coach also put out feelers about a possible return to Espana.However, now seems like the perfect time for Jarencio to actually come back.In Season 80, in the second year of head coach Boy Sablan, the Growling Tigers went 1-13, winning their last regular season game by three points over the UE Red Warriors to barely avoid the school's first winless season.In Season 79, UST went 3-11 under Sablan, the Tigers' worst season in the Final Four era prior to this year.After Jarencio's exit and before Sablan came in, Bong Dela Cruz coached UST to a 5-9 record in Season 77 before making all the way to Game 3 of the UAAP Finals in Season 78.He left under controversial circumstances after the Tigers' Finals loss to Nash Racela's FEU Tamaraws.Since leaving UST after Season 76, Jarencio has been part of the Globalport Batang Pier in the PBA.Just recently, he took over as the Batang Pier's head coach for a third time after Franz Pumaren took a leave of absence to focus on Adamson's Season 80 campaign.Still, Pumaren is expected to get the Globalport job back once the Falcons wrap up their season. If that's not the case though, the source says that Jarencio is focused enough to take on both jobs if he does regain his former UST status as the Growling Tigers' head coach.During his first stint in UST, Jarencio led the Tigers to three UAAP Finals, winning the UAAP title in 2006, the school's last championship so far.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @paullintag8",

EVERYTHING.De La Salle University's Ben Mbala wouldn't just let archrival Ateneo de Manila University through the express lane.Scoring 28 points on 10-of-20 shooting on top of 19 rebounds, six steals, and six blocks, the reigning MVP helped the Green Archers reign supreme, 79-76, and halt the Blue Eagles' bid for a 14-0 elimination sweep.Dominant on both ends of the court, Mbala was able to snag the last Chooks-to-Go UAAP Press Corps Player of the Week recognition, besting University of the Philippines captain Paul Desiderio, University of Sto. Tomas slotman Steve Akomo, and Far Eastern University sniper Arvin Tolentino for the weekly individual award.The Cameroonian bruisers worth for DLSU couldnt be more overstated as he kept the ship afloat even after falling behind by as much as 12 points in the fourth quarter and by seven, 69-76, in the final 2:24.\"We just wanted to win. We didn't quit. Coach told us, never give up,\" he said.With heas coach Aldin Ayo fuming on the bench, Mbala and the rest of the Green Archers got down to work and finally solved the puzzle that was the Blue Eagles as they staged a killer 10-0 finishing kick before Mbala delivered the exclamation point  a game-saving defensive stop on Isaac Go with 10 seconds left on the clock.\"Coach told me to never quit on defense, to just always be there and try your best to give him the hardest shot he can have and that's what I tried my best to do, he said. He told me to stay composed and not overdo everything. I was trying to jump straight up and that's the only thing I was able to do, because if I foul him, that would have been two easy free throws.Mbalas herculean efforts allowed the defending champions to sweep the second round and wind up with a 12-2 slate.The Green Archers, armed with a twice-to-beat advantage, now proceed to the Final Four where they meet third-seed Adamson University once again on Saturday..\"That's the plan to do for the next few games: to play hard and leave the rest to God,\" he said.",

Terrill, File)The Associated Press - Houston Astros dynamo Jose Altuve won the American League MVP award on Thursday, towering over New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge by a wide margin.The 5-foot-6 Altuve drew 27 of the 30 first-place votes in balloting by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.Altuve batted a major league-best .346. He hit 24 home runs with 81 RBIs, scored 112 times, stole 32 bases and showed a sharp glove at second base.The 6-foot-7 Judge won the AL Rookie of the Year award Monday. He set a rookie record with 52 home runs.Jose Ramirez of the Cleveland Indians finished third.Altuve helped lead the Astros to their first World Series championship. Voting for these honors was completed before the postseason began.Altuve was the second Houston player to win an MVP  Jeff Bagwell earned the 1994 NL award.Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton won the NL MVP, barely edging Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds.In the closest MVP vote since 1979, Stanton became only the sixth player to win from a losing team.Stanton led the big leagues with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs. His highlight-reel homer total was the most in the majors since 2001, when Barry Bonds hit a record 73 and Sammy Sosa had 64.Stanton got 10 first-place votes and 302 points. Votto, who led the majors with a .454 on-base percentage, also got 10 firsts and had 300 points. Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt was third.The last time an MVP race was so close, Willie Stargell and Keith Hernandez tied for the NL prize in 1979. Stanton became the first Marlins player to win the award.The Marlins went 77-85 this season, and new team executive Derek Jeter says the club is listening to trade offers for Stanton.

    "text": "Baseball Manfred: MLB pace changes will happen with or without unionBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred listens to a question following the two-day meeting of Major League Baseball owners, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Major League Baseball will change rules to speed games next year with or without an agreement with the players' association.Management proposed last offseason to institute a 20-second pitch clock, allow one trip to the mound by a catcher per pitcher each inning and raise the bottom of the strike zone from just beneath the kneecap to its pre-1996 level at the top of the kneecap. The union didn't agree, and clubs have the right to impose those changes unilaterally for 2018.Players and MLB have held initial bargaining since summer, and MLB chief legal officer Dan Halem said this week he would like an agreement by mid-January.\"My preferred path is a negotiated agreement with the players, but if we can't get an agreement we are going to have rule changes in 2018 one way or the other,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday after a quarterly owners' meeting.Nine-inning games averaged a record 3 hours, 5 minutes during the regular season and 3:29 during the postseason.There are ongoing talks for a new posting system with Japan to replace the deal that expired Nov. 1, one that would allow star Japanese pitcher/outfielder Shohei Otani to leave the Pacific League's Nippon Ham Fighters to sign with a big league team.MLB agreed last month to a framework with Nippon Professional Baseball that would keep the rules of the expired deal pretty much in place this offseason, allowing a high posting fee of $20 million.Starting next offseason, the fee would be 15 percent of the guarantee of a major league contract and 20 percent of the signing bonus of a minor league contract, a person familiar with that negotiation said, speaking on condition of anonymity because no announcement was made.The union informed MLB on Thursday that it had set a Monday deadline for reaching a deal, according to Manfred. The union doesn't want the uncertainty of Otani's situation to hold up teams' negotiations with other free agents, another person familiar with the talks said, also speaking on condition of anonymity because no announcement was made.\"I'm hopeful that the union will find a way to get on board and we'll open that player market up and let players who want to play here see if they can get signed,\" Manfred said. \"These are relatively small issues.\"On other topics:RECORD HOME RUNSOwners were told experts are looking into the specifications of baseballs after a record 6,105 home runs were hit this season.\"There's going to be activity on that front during the offseason, and we'll have more to say on that at some point during the offseason,\" Manfred said.KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEMOakland catcher Bruce Maxwell was the only MLB player to kneel during the national anthem this year, a contrast to the many NFL players who participated in the protest.\"I'm really proud of the way that our players have conducted themselves with respect to the anthem,\" Manfred said. \"They've been respectful. That respect is completely consistent with the kind of good works they do in their communities every day.\"PROTECTIVE NETTINGOwners were updated about team decisions on expanded protective netting, made after several fans were injured by foul balls this year. MLB has not decided whether to change the league-wide minimums.\"I'm not prepared to say exactly what next year's going to be,\" Manfred said.BALLPARK FINANCINGCongress is considering in tax legislation a prohibition on the use of tax-free municipal bonds for ballpark financing.\"The clubs and central baseball are very aware of that provision in the tax bill and, like all good citizens, we intend to weigh on the propriety of that particular legislative change,\" Manfred said.INTERNATIONAL SIGNINGSManfred said he has worked to stop improprieties in international signings. Atlanta general manager John Coppolella resigned Oct. 2 along with special assistant Gordon Blakeley. On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh Pirates said they wouldn't renew the contract of Latin American scouting director Rene Gayo. Both clubs said the moves occurred after an investigation revealed rule violations.\"Going back to the very first time that I addressed the general managers after I was elected, I told them that one of my goals was to be more diligent with rest to the enforcement of all of our rules, but particularly our rules as they affect the signing of international players,\" Manfred said.MONTREAL EXPANSIONDenis Coderre, the Montreal mayor who pushed for MLB's return to the city, was defeated last week in his bid for re-election. Manfred repeated that no decisions on expansion will be made until after Oakland and Tampa Bay resolve their quests for new ballpark.\"I'm not sure who's going to be the mayor of Montreal at that point,\" Manfred said. \"I do know that it would be extraordinarily unlikely for baseball to return to Montreal without some concrete plan as to where a team would play. We're not going back to playing in Olympic Stadium.\"CENTRAL OFFICE RESTRUCTINGManfred anticipates a restructuring on central baseball's administration and MLB Advanced Media will take place before the end of the year.TICKETSA new contract with StubHub for selling tickets on the secondary market was approved.POLITICAL UPDATEKenneth Duberstein, a White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, and Denis McDonough, who held the same job under President Barack Obama, spoke to owners on Wednesday.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)By Jake Seiner, Associated PressMax Scherzer heard his name and thrust his arms in the air, shouting and smiling big before turning to kiss his wife.Corey Kluber, on the other hand, gulped once and blinked.Two aces, two different styles  and now another Cy Young Award for each.The animated Scherzer of the Washington Nationals coasted to his third Cy Young, winning Wednesday for the second straight year in the National League. He breezed past Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, drawing 27 of the 30 first-place votes in balloting by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.Kluber's win was even more of a runaway. The Cleveland Indians ace took 28 first-place votes, easily outpacing Chris Sale of the Boston Red Sox for his second AL Cy Young.Scherzer yelled \"yes!\" when his award was announced on MLB Network, a reaction in keeping with his expressive reputation. He showed that intensity often this year, whether he was cursing under his breath like a madman during his delivery or demanding  also with expletives  that manager Dusty Baker leave him in the game.Just a little different than the pitcher they call \"Klubot.\" Kluber was stoic as ever when announced as the AL winner. He swallowed hard but otherwise didn't react, only showing the hint of a smile moments later when answering questions.Not that he wasn't thrilled.\"Winning a second one maybe, for me personally, kind of validates the first one,\" Kluber said.Scherzer's win moves him into rare company. He's the 10th pitcher with at least three Cy Youngs, and among the other nine, only Kershaw, Roger Clemens and the late Roy Halladay aren't in the Hall of Fame  Kershaw and Halladay aren't yet eligible.\"That's why I'm drinking a lot of champagne tonight,\" Scherzer said.Scherzer earned the NL honor last year with Washington and the 2013 American League prize with Detroit.\"This one is special,\" he said. \"When you start talking about winning three times, I can't even comprehend it at this point.\"Scherzer was 16-6 with a career-best 2.51 ERA this year. The 33-year-old righty struck out a league-leading 268 for the NL East champion Nationals, and in an era noted for declining pitcher durability, he eclipsed 200 innings for the fifth straight season. He had to overcome a variety of ailments to get there, and Washington's training staff was high on his thank-you list.\"Everybody had a role in keeping me out on the field,\" he said. \"I'm very thankful for all their hard work.\"Kershaw has won three NL Cy Youngs and was the last pitcher to win back-to-back. He was 18-4 with a league-best 2.31 ERA and 202 strikeouts. This is his second runner-up finish. Stephen Strasburg of the Nationals finished third.Kluber missed a month of the season with back pain and still easily won the AL award over Sale and third-place finisher Luis Severino of the New York Yankees. Kluber led the majors with a 2.25 ERA, and his 18 wins tied for the most in baseball. He added to the Cy Young he won with the Indians in 2014 and is the 19th pitcher to win multiple times.The 31-year-old Kluber was especially dominant down the stretch, closing out the season by going 11-1 to help Cleveland win the AL Central. He and Minnesota's Ervin Santana tied for the major league lead with five complete games  nobody else had more than two. Kluber also led the majors with 8.0 wins above replacement, per baseball-reference.com.Kluber and Scherzer both had rough outings in the playoffs. Kluber gave up nine runs over two starts in an AL Division Series against the Yankees, and Scherzer blew a save in the decisive Game 5 of an NL Division Series against the Cubs.Scherzer said he couldn't even watch the League Championship Series, although he did tune in for the World Series.\"That will eat at me this whole offseason,\" he said.Voting for the awards was completed before the postseason began.The final BBWAA honors will come Thursday when the MVP awards are announced in the AL and NL.",

The New York Yankees announced Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, that Girardi will not return to the team in the 2018 season. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Not even a World Series title would have saved Joe Girardi's job managing the New York Yankees.Owner Hal Steinbrenner revealed the decision to end Girardi's tenure after a decade had long been discussed before the move was announced Oct. 26, five days after the season-ending loss to Houston in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series.A 28th title wouldn't have caused Steinbrenner to change his mind.\"I'm sure there would have been more pressure,\" Steinbrenner said Wednesday. \"It maybe would have been a more difficult decision to make, but I still believe I would have made it because I felt that's what's best for the organization going forward.\"Speaking after he arrived for a major league owners' meeting, Steinbrenner said he had spoken regularly with general manager Brian Cashman about the manager's job throughout Girardi's four-year contract.\"This is not something that came from two or three weeks.\" Steinbrenner said. \"It came from two, three, four years and everything we observed in that time period.\"Cashman last week attributed the decision to Girardi's \"ability to fully engage, communicate, connect with the playing personnel.\" Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Greg Bird and Luis Severino have led a roster overhaul, and Steinbrenner thinks infielders Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar, along with pitcher Chance Adams, could be with their team at the start of next season or not too much later.\"You've got to consider the fact that you have a young team and that maybe a different type of leadership perhaps is needed for a younger team than it is for a veteran team,\" he said.Bench coach Rob Thomson and former Cleveland and Seattle manager Eric Wedge already have been interviewed, and Aaron Boone and Hensley Meulens could follow in coming days. Steinbrenner expects the initial field to be less than 10, and finalists will move on to a second round of interviews in Tampa that include Steinbrenner and his siblings.\"It's important for the next manager to have an understanding on analytics, because it's such a big part of the game, and if they don't, at least a willingness to learn,\" Steinbrenner said.He is wary, but not opposed, to candidates with no previous managing or coaching experience.\"Presidential candidates normally are senators or governors,\" he said.Alex Rodriguez has not asked to be considered. Now that A-Rod's $275 million, 10-year contract has expired, Steinbrenner would like to reach a new deal with him to instruct with prospects.\"He's very good with the young players and they look up to him,\" Steinbrenner said. \"We've got a lot of good shortstops and middle infielders down below as well as up top.\"Steinbrenner said Andujar could wind up starting at third base, where Chase Headley started last season. He was supplanted by Todd Frazier, who became a free agent.\"We've got guys at Double-A that are going to move quickly to Triple-A, I think, and we've got guys at Triple-A that may need a month or two there and they may be ready,\" Steinbrenner said.He remains intent on the Yankees finishing 2018 below next year's luxury tax threshold of $197 million, which would reset New York's base tax rate from 50 percent to 20 percent in 2019  the season after Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and possibly Clayton Kershaw are eligible for free agency.\"I believe it's very attainable,\" he said.New York was last under $200 million in 2003, the year the tax began.\"Their revenue is almost triple, over double what it was 10, 15 years ago,\" agent Scott Boras said. \"The fact that their payroll is going to be under what it was 10 or 15 years ago is really something that everyone in the game has to look at and consider as to what are their goals.\"NOTES: Steinbrenner says Cashman wants to stay as GM and he wants him to remain but they haven't had time to reach a new deal. ... New York's decision to move the start times of Monday-Thursday night April home games up 30 minutes to 6:35 p.m. could lead to all evening games beginning earlier in future years. \"I want to see how it goes and then that absolutely might be the case,\" Steinbrenner said.",

Shohei Otani is likely to leave Japan and sign with a Major League Baseball team after this season, multiple reports in Japanese media said Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2017, a move that would cost the 23-year-old pitcher and outfielder more than $100 million. (AP Photo/Toru Takahashi, File)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Major League Baseball hopes to put in place a new posting system agreement with Japan by early December, a deal that would allow star pitcher-outfielder Shohei Otani to start negotiations with big league teams.MLB Chief Legal Officer Dan Halem said a new framework has been agreed to with Nippon Professional Baseball and has been given to the Major League Baseball Players Association for its approval.\"I'm hopeful that we can wrap up our discussions with the union soon, maybe within a week,\" he said Wednesday at the general managers' meetings.After that, MLB owners would hold a conference call for an approval vote.\"I'm hopeful that we'll have a new system in place in which players can be posted by the NPB in early December,\" he said.Otani, a 23-year-old with the Pacific League's Nippon Ham Fighters, would be restricted to a minor league contract with a maximum signing bonus of $3,535,000, with each team having different amounts to spend.Halem also hopes to have a separate deal with the players' association by mid-January on pace-of-play changes such as a pitch clock, limits on mound visits. Baseball also is considering split screens to allow commercials on broadcasts as half-innings start.\"Proposals have been exchanged and in-person meetings have taken place,\" he said. \"I would characterize those discussions as being in the beginning. We have a ways to go. In terms of the calendar, I think we would need to complete those discussions by mid-January in order to effectively roll them out and explain them to umpires and our clubs.\"Nine-inning games averaged a record 3 hours, 5 minutes during the regular season and 3:29 in the postseason.Owners have the right for next season to unilaterally institute a 20-second pitch clock and limit a catcher to one mound visit per pitcher each inning, but baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred prefers to reach an agreement with the union in time for next season.\"Both discussions are 'ongoing' and we remain 'optimistic,'\" union head Tony Clark wrote in an email to The Associated Press.Halem said baseball officials and general managers discussed sign stealing this week and teams were reminded that watches with internet capability are prohibited from dugouts. Boston was fined in September for improper use of an Apple watch.After a season in which a record 6,105 home runs were hit, topping the 5,963 in 2000 at the height of the Steroids Era, MLB is examining baseballs and quality control.\"We have consultants that are on retainer that look at all of our equipment, including the baseball,\" Halem said. \"The test results for the baseballs this year, including the postseason, were no different than the test results in prior seasons. That being said, it is an issue that has generated a lot of discussion, so we are thoroughly reviewing the entire testing process and the way baseballs are handled to determine whether changes should be made.\"",

Jeter says he will help develop a winning culture with the Marlins that will emphasize hard work, discipline and no excuses. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Now a rookie executive instead of a veteran player, Derek Jeter arrived for his first major league owners' meeting and said the Miami Marlins are listening to trade offers for slugging outfielder Giancarlo Stanton.Jeter became the Marlins' chief executive officer when a group headed by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman bought the team Oct. 2 from Jeffrey Loria. The former New York Yankees captain, a five-time World Series champion, said Miami needed to turn around both on and off the field. Payroll will be cut, and Stanton could be dealt after hitting 59 home runs  the highest total in the major leagues since 2001.\"We're exploring options, what opportunities are there,\" Jeter said Wednesday. \"We're listening. Teams haven't only reached out about Stanton. They've reached out about a lot of our players, which says a lot about the players in our organization.\"Stanton a 28-year-old outfielder, is guaranteed $295 million over the remaining decade of his record 13-year contract. He will earn $25 million next season and has a full no-trade provision, giving him power to control any deal.\"There are some financial things we have to get in order,\" Jeter said. \"It's an organization that's been losing money for quite some time, so we have to turn that around. How we do that, it's not clear. Yeah, I think it's easy to point the finger at him because he makes the most money, but that doesn't necessarily mean that that's the move that's going to be made.\"A 14-time All-Star over 20 big league seasons in a playing career that ended three years ago, Jeter swapped his Yankees pinstripes for a blue-gray business suit, white shirt without a necktie and black cap-toe shoes. He never played on a team with a losing record during 23 professional seasons, so the Marlins have a traditional he is unacquainted with.\"The team hasn't been in the playoffs since 2003 and haven't had a winning season since '09. So that's unacceptable,\" he said. \"It's unacceptable to the ownership group. It's unacceptable to the fan base. So yes, it will take time. But every team has to go through a period where they have to build, and we're in that position right now.\"Miami had a $116 million payroll on Aug. 31, up from $81 million at the end of last year. In the prime of his career, Stanton would prefer to be on a winning team.\"I think a lot of this started when he came out and expressed publicly that he didn't want to be a part of a rebuild,\" Jeter said.Jeter is at work to hire a head of business operations and said the team will try to increase revenue by selling naming rights to Marlins Park, which opened in 2012.A long-time resident of Tampa, Jeter said he had acquired a home in Miami.\"I think I've been back to Tampa two days since we've gotten this team,\" he said.Now 43, Jeter had long expressed a goal of owning a big league franchise.\"It's strange to think of Derek being involved and wearing the colors of a different club,\" Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner said. \"He's going to do great there. He knows baseball. He's a good leader and, obviously, very hard-working.\"Steinbrenner also opined: \"He's got his hands full.\"Mike Hill, the Marlins' president of baseball operations, says he is in contact with Jeter about five times daily. While Hill has communicated with Stanton, Jeter has not.\"When the time is right, we'll speak,\" Jeter said. \"I don't know how often the owner calls and talks to all the players on the team and shares visions.\"NOTES: Jeter confirmed former Marlins Andre Dawson, Tony Perez, Jeff Conine and Jack McKeon turned down the chance to stay with the team in reduced roles with lower salaries. \"They came into the office. We spoke to them, let them know what capacity it was, and it was their decision. And I respect that decision.\"",

Martinez to the D-backs.\"We are going to be one year better,\" he said, adding his club would be even \"more united\" in 2018.Molitor won the American League Manager of the Year award after the Twins became the first team to make the playoffs following a 100-loss season.Molitor drew 18 of the 30 first-place votes in balloting by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.Cleveland's Terry Francona was second and A.J. Hinch of the World Series champion Houston Astros finished third. Voting was completed before the start of the playoffs.Lovullo got 18 first-place votes, too, in earning the National League prize. Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers was second and Colorado's Bud Black was third.Roberts, Black, Milwaukee's Craig Counsell and Dusty Baker, since let go by Washington, also had first-place votes.Molitor joined Frank Robinson as the only Hall of Fame players to win a manager of the year award, which was first presented in 1983.\"I was aware of some of the history,\" Molitor said.The Twins went 85-77 this season and captured their first playoff spot since 2010 before losing to the Yankees in the AL wild-card game. Last year, the Twins led the majors with 103 losses.Brian Dozier, Joe Mauer and their Minnesota teammates were in the midst of a 5-13 slide when the Twins traded closer Brandon Kintzler to Washington for a minor leaguer less than a month after he made the All-Star team. They also dealt away Jaime Garcia after he won his only start since they got him from Atlanta.\"A little bit of a wrinkle,\" Molitor said.Molitor's message to the Twins at that point was \"not magical,\" he said. Instead, it was fairly simple and straightforward: Believe in yourselves.\"I still had a lot of optimism,\" he said.The 61-year-old Molitor was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, and got the last of his 3,319 career hits with the Twins in 1998.Shortly after the playoff loss, Molitor got a new three-year contract to continue managing the Twins.The 52-year-old Lovullo guided the Diamondbacks to a 93-69 record and their first playoff spot since 2011, a year after they went 69-93.Lovullo was Boston's bench coach when he ran the Red Sox for 48 games in 2015 while manager John Farrell underwent cancer treatment.Powered by Paul Goldschmidt, Jake Lamb and Martinez, and led by pitchers Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray, the Diamondbacks made the playoffs this year. They beat Colorado in the NL wild-card game before getting swept by the Dodgers in the Division Series.The Diamondbacks were swept in a three-game series at Minnesota in mid-August, outscored 27-8 at Target Field. Less than a week later, Arizona began a franchise-record 13-game winning streak.Going into a new season, Lovullo's team has a new target.\"It didn't end the way we wanted. The Dodgers walked through us,\" he said.",

The New York Yankees announced Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, that Girardi will not return to the team in the 2018 season. The announcement was made by Yankees Senior Vice President and General Manager Brian Cashman. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Joe Girardi expected to be back for an 11th season as New York Yankees manager.\"I was a little shocked,\" he said of his dismissal Tuesday after attending a meeting of Major League Baseball's competition committee.Yankees general manager Brian Cashman announced his decision Oct. 26, and then explained last week he made the move because of \"ability to fully engage, communicate, connect with the playing personnel.\"Girardi said he wasn't disappointed about the statements.\"I'm one that (is) pretty aware of what happens and what goes on inside a clubhouse ... so I don't ever worry about that,\" he said.\"You know, it's life,\" he added. \"You understand that you have to move on. I invested a lot of time in there and have a lot of great memories there. But this is part of life. When you take a job as a manager, you know that this is a possibility, and you have to deal with this. You also get to deal with the other side, the excitement of being hired.\"His 910-710 regular-season record with the Yankees is sixth in victories managing the team, and he led New York to its 27th World Series title in 2009.Girardi anticipates having discussions after Thanksgiving about working as a broadcaster for a national network. He will not return next year to the Yankees' YES Network, where he worked in 2007 before he was hired to manage the team.\"I think that would be kind of strange,\" he said.New York has interviewed bench coach Rob Thomson and former Cleveland and Seattle manager Eric Wedge for the opening, and Cashman expects interviews to resume after the general managers' meetings this week. Girardi is aware of the search.\"It's hard not to, because if you go on a website or if you're watching TV, it flashes across the bottom,\" he said. \"But it's not something that I'm paying close attention to.\"Former Yankees captain Derek Jeter, now in charge of the Miami Marlins' baseball and business operations, was part of the competition committee meeting.\"I'm going to stay with it as long as they want me. So it's kind of what I do,\" Girardi said, laughing.",

(AP Photo/Steve Nesius)By Fred Goodall, Associated PressCLEARWATER, Fla. (AP)  Two-time Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay was remembered Tuesday as an amazing husband, father, friend and teammate who was one of the best pitchers of his generation but an even better man.A 91-minute \"Celebration of Life for Roy Halladay\" attracted more than 1,000 people to Spectrum Field, the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies, one of two franchises Halladay played for during a stellar 16-year career.\"The man made the ballplayer,\" Phillies owner John Middleton said, \"not the other way around,\"Halladay died Nov. 7 at age 40 when the private plane he was piloting crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida.The eight-time All-Star who pitched a perfect game and a playoff no-hitter, Halladay played 12 seasons for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1998-2009 and four for the Phillies from 2009-13, going 203-105 with a 3.38 career ERA.The public memorial began with a video tribute and ended with Halladay's wife, Brandy, standing on the mound and releasing butterflies from a container in final \"goodbye.\"\"All eyes are on me,\" the pitcher's wife, the last of nine speakers, said from a rostrum perched behind the mound, flanked by pictures of Halladay with the Phillies and Blue Jays, along with floral arrangements bearing the 34 and 32 jersey numbers he wore.\"I'm really fortunate that I've gotten used to that feeling. I've literally been standing next to a man for 21 years that people could not take their eyes off of,\" she said. \"He was awe-striking. He was beautiful inside and out.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)By Ronald Blum, Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  For sale: 28-year-old chiseled slugger who led the major leagues with 59 home runs, the most in 16 years.Price: $295 million over a decade.Complication: Giancarlo Stanton only goes where he wants to, since the star right fielder has a full no-trade provision.Now under a new ownership group that put former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter in charge of baseball and business operations, the Miami Marlins have concluded their payroll-paring regime is willing to explore trades of Stanton and other high-priced players.\"I think over the next few days I'll get a feel for what the marketplace is for our players,\" Marlins president of baseball operations Mike Hill said Monday, the opening day of the annual general managers' meetings.Miami had a $116 million payroll on Aug. 31, up from $81 million at the end of last year. Bruce Sherman's group bought the team on Oct. 2 from Jeffrey Loria and is exploring trades for players who contributed to the team's eighth straight losing season. The Marlins have not made the playoffs since winning the 2003 World Series, the second-longest postseason drought behind Seattle.Stanton's salary jumps from $14.5 million this year to $25 million next season. It peaks at $32 million annually from 2023-25.When he spoke Oct. 25 at the World Series while receiving an award, Stanton said he didn't have \"stamped-out ideas\" whether he would want to stay in Miami during a rebuild. The Marlins seem to know which teams he would accept a trade to.\"I do have a sense, and we'll keep that internal, and at the appropriate time we'll discuss whatever we need to discuss,\" Hill said. \"We work internally. We do what we need to do, and then if we need to present him with something, we'll do so at the appropriate time.\"Among other costly Marlins next year are third baseman Martin Prado ($14 million), right-hander Edinson Volquez ($13 million), center fielder Christian Yelich ($7 million, with $37.5 million more guaranteed over the following three years) and second baseman Dee Gordon ($10.5 million, with $27.5 million guaranteed over the following two seasons).Given a penurious approach, the Marlins may find trades make sense.\"It's tough to be competitive if you're overly concentrated in two or three players,\" New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. \"I think we experienced some of that last year.\"High-revenue teams would be the most likely matches. The New York Yankees do not appear to be a probable destination. Right fielder Aaron Judge won the AL Rookie of the Year award unanimously after hitting 52 homers, center fielder Aaron Hicks played well when he wasn't hurt, and Clint Frazier is competing for playing time among a group that includes veterans Brett Gardner and Jacoby Ellsbury.\"We have a lot of good players signed, so we're not in a situation where we have to be pressured into moving fast on anything,\" general manager Brian Cashman said. \"It gives us a little bit of a chance to be patient and engage the market and see if there's any value to be had via trade or free agencies for us because we have a lot pieces currently in place and more pieces coming.\"New York does figure to be interested in 23-year-old Japanese right-hander and outfielder Shohei Otani, a two-way player who wants to sign with a major league team. But the Major League Baseball Players Association does not seem close to an agreement on a new posting deal with MLB management and Nippon Professional Baseball. That could push off Otani negotiations for weeks or months.Teams are having trade discussions and agents also are the hotel, pitching their clients to teams.Cashman is not meeting with manager candidates during the GM session. Yankees bench coach Rob Thomson and former Cleveland and Seattle manager Eric Wedge were interviewed last week, and Cashman would not deny reports that San Francisco bench coach Hensley Meulens will be interviewed.Former Yankees outfielder Carlos Beltran, who announced his retirement Monday after 20 big league seasons, could be a contender.\"He's played the game a long time. He knows the game inside-out. He's obviously got respect of his peers and (is) bilingual,\" Cashman said. \"He brings a lot to the table in terms of someone that's played the game the right way and had a great career and goes out with a world championship ring and is highly respected I would say across all environments of our industry.\"",

It was Judge's 50th home run, which sets a new record the most home runs hit by a rookie in the MLB. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)By Noah Trister, Associated PressThe only major question was whether it would be unanimous  and it was.Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger are baseball's Rookies of the Year, after their record-setting home run binges left no need for any dissenting opinions. Judge led the American League with 52 homers, the most ever by a rookie. Bellinger hit 39 and had to settle for the National League's rookie record.Judge and Bellinger received every first-place vote available from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Judge became the first New York Yankees player to receive this award since Derek Jeter in 1996. Bellinger gave the Dodgers a record 18th Rookie of the Year winner.\"Watching him from the West Coast, what he did on the East Coast, was awesome,\" Bellinger said. \"I was a big fan of his, and met him during the All-Star game, and he's a humble dude. I think we're both reflecting, now that the season's over, on the kind of seasons that we've had.\"This was the first time both Rookie of the Year awards were unanimous since 1997, when Nomar Garciaparra of Boston and Scott Rolen of Philadelphia won.This season's votes were announced Monday night. Boston outfielder Andrew Benintendi finished second in the AL, followed by Baltimore slugger Trey Mancini. St. Louis infielder Paul DeJong was the NL runner-up, with Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell finishing third.Judge is also an MVP finalist.\"Obviously it was an amazing, remarkable year that no one would have predicted,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. \"When you drop 52  I think he really should have had 53, one that instant replay didn't protect. ... It should be a higher number. It was just an incredible year.\"Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 and Fred Lynn in 1975 are the only players to win the AL MVP and Rookie of the Year awards in the same year.The Yankees entered this season with marginal expectations by their standards, but the prodigious power of Judge and catcher Gary Sanchez transformed them almost overnight into an exciting young team with tremendous potential. They made the postseason as a wild card.\"It's exciting times right now to be wearing pinstripes,\" Judge said. \"To come up through the minor leagues with a lot of these guys, watch them develop, and now to see what they're doing at the major league level is really impressive.\"Judge's 495-foot shot on June 11 was the longest home run in the major leagues this season, according to Statcast . Although he struck out 208 times in the regular season and 27 more in the postseason, the 25-year-old outfielder is one of a handful of reasons why the Yankees suddenly seem to have one of the brightest futures of any team in baseball.New York came within a victory of the World Series this year, losing to Houston in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series. Bellinger's team made it to that final step, but Los Angeles fell to the Astros in a seven-game World Series.Bellinger is the second straight Dodgers player to win Rookie of the Year. Shortstop Corey Seager did it last year.\"The future is bright in L.A.,\" Bellinger said. \"I know that I'm excited, as well as the other teammates. Obviously, we didn't have the end goal this year, but we're going to try and take it to the next level next year.\"Bellinger made his big league debut in late April. By the time he turned 22 on July 13, he had 25 home runs. The 6-foot-4 first baseman is an appropriate counterpart to the powerful Judge. They even hit from opposite sides of the plate: Judge is a righty and Bellinger swings left-handed.\"He's not just a guy that went up there and hit home runs,\" Judge said. \"He was a guy that played high-caliber first base for them. He could go out there and roam center field, left field, right field, wherever they needed him. To have that type of versatility and produce the numbers he did is something that you don't find too often.\"___AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in Orlando, Florida, contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Baseball Braves hire former Dodgers, Blue Jays exec Anthopoulos as GMAlex Anthopoulos speaks to reporters following a news conference introducing him as the new general manager of the Atlanta Braves baseball team in Atlanta, Monday, Nov. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/David Goldman)By Charles Odum, Associated PressATLANTA (AP)  The remake of the Atlanta Braves' management was completed Monday when Alex Anthopoulos was named general manager and John Hart was removed as team president.Anthopoulos, a former Dodgers and Blue Jays executive, will have autonomy of baseball operations, giving him more power than any Braves general manager since John Schuerholz served from 1990 to 2007. Anthopoulos also was given the title of executive vice president, while Hart will assume a senior adviser role, team chairman Terry McGuirk announced at a news conference that Hart did not attend.Anthopoulos was to fly to Orlando on Monday night to represent the Braves at baseball's general managers' meetings.He spent the last two seasons as the Dodgers' vice president of baseball operations after six years as Toronto's general manager.Anthopoulos succeeds John Coppolella, who was forced to resign as general manager on Oct. 2 after an investigation by Major League Baseball disclosed rule violations committed by the Braves in the international player market.\"Alex is a man of integrity and he will operate in a way that will make all of our Braves fans proud,\" McGuirk said.McGuirk apologized to fans \"on behalf of the entire Braves family\" for the scandal.\"The past few months have been the toughest in the storied history of the Atlanta Braves franchise,\" he said. \"Frankly, the Atlanta Braves have not lived up to our standard that the fans expect of us and that we expect of ourselves.\"McGuirk said he was told by Commissioner Rob Manfred on Monday \"the investigation has been completed for some time.\"He said he expects to learn within two weeks what fine or other penalties the Braves will receive.When asked who made the decision for Hart to immediately hand over control of baseball operations, McGuirk said, \"It just became obvious this was the right thing to do at this time, and he and I made that decision together.\"Hart temporarily assumed general manager duties while leading the search for Coppolella's replacement.Gordon Blakeley, the team's international scouting chief, also resigned last month following the disclosure of international scouting violations.Anthopoulos said the investigation had no impact on his interest in the Braves.\"For me more than anything else, who are you going to work for and who are you going to work with?\" Anthopoulos said. \"Regardless of what the fallout was going to be or what the sanctions may be, that's not going to change who I'm going to go to war with day in and day out.\"Anthopoulos said the Braves, who opened SunTrust Park in 2017 and whose minor league organization was named the best in the game by Baseball America, are \"one of the premier jobs in all of sports.\"\"The young talent here is as good as you're going to get in the game, and even here at the big league level, you have some exciting players as well,\" he said. \"The opportunity here, the upside, is through the roof.\"Braves manager Brian Snitker and former manager and current senior adviser Bobby Cox attended the news conference. Cox was part of the Braves management team that met with Anthopoulos at SunTrust Park during a break between Games 5 and 6 of the World Series.Cox said Anthopoulos was \"a home run\" in the interview.\"He's smart as heck and a workaholic,\" Cox said. \"I've heard that from everyone.\"Anthopoulos began his baseball career with the Montreal Expos as a publicity intern before moving to scouting for three years. He joined Toronto after the 2003 season as a scouting coordinator and earned a promotion to VP of baseball operations and assistant GM in 2006 before taking over as GM.",

    "text": "Baseball Royals' Yost: 'Glad to be alive' after injury on farmFILE - In this Aug. 29, 2017, file photo, Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost listens to a reporter's question before a baseball game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. Yost broke a pelvis and several ribs during a fall on his property in Georgia, Saturday, Nov. 4, when a deer stand he was working on gave way and fell to the ground, Kansas City spokesman Mike Swanson said. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, File)By Dave Skretta, Associated PressKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Ned Yost spent Monday afternoon in a lounge chair at his farm just outside Atlanta, the pain from a shattered pelvis so unbearable that the only movement the Royals manager could make was to reposition.He was happy for the pain, though. It reminded him he was alive.Just over a week ago, Yost was working in a hunting stand on his property when he reached to attach a safety line. The stand somehow collapsed and Yost fell about 20 feet to the ground, and the landing was so hard that he sustained a \"massive fracture\" to his pelvis and four broken ribs.He also lost so much blood that surgeons later told him he nearly died.\"I didn't understand the gravity of the situation until I was through it,\" said the 62-year-old Yost, an avid outdoorsman. \"I'm just glad I had my phone, I'll tell you that.\"Yost said he can't put weight on either leg for at least two months, which means he's confined to his lounge chair or a wheelchair. There are two rods, some plates and screws holding his pelvis together, and a good number of staples that are helping to keep the incision closed.But he vowed that by spring training, \"I should be pretty much full-go.\"Anybody who knows Yost wouldn't think otherwise.The curmudgeonly manager prides himself on his toughness, a trait he's instilled in the Royals over the years. It served them well in turning around their fortunes, too, from a sad-sack squad that regularly lost 100 games to a team that went to back-to-back World Series and won the championship in 2015.Still, the injury that Yost sustained tested even his toughness.Yost said his wife, Deb, had left just after noon on Nov. 4 to attend a nephew's wedding in Alabama, so he hopped in a four-wheeler and headed out on his property. His intention was to check his tree stands and prepare them for winter, and he took care of the first stand without any problems.He drove to a second tree stand and climbed up wearing his safety belt. The stand felt solid at first, but as he reached around the tree to clip in, \"it was like a hang-man's gallows.\"\"Down I went,\" Yost said. \"I hit on my right side.\"Yost was fortunate that he had his cellphone nearby, and was able to call Deb for help. He's been in the tree stands before and reached for his phone to find he'd forgotten it, and admits thinking to himself those times, \"That is so stupid! What if something happened?\"Yost's wife was able to contact 911, then guide responders to where her husband had fallen. Its remote nature and the severity of Yost's injury meant a helicopter was needed to get him to the hospital.Once there, doctors resorted to emergency surgery to stop the bleeding, and required eight units of blood to replace what Yost had lost. They also put him in what he described as \"really tight compression pants,\" and at one point he told the emergency room doctor that \"you guys are killing me.\"\"The guy said, 'Look, Ned, this is going to save your life,'\" Yost said.Yost underwent another surgery the next day to repair the pelvis, and doctors then told him that the fracture was so severe and blood loss so great that 25 percent to 30 percent of similar cases result in death.\"I thought I was going to be fine. Ok, my pelvis is broken. I'm a pretty tough guy. I can handle the pain,\" Yost said. \"I mean, it was a little scary getting on that helicopter because I was in so much pain, getting really, really woozy. But I still felt like I was in great hands.\"I'm glad to be alive and I'm glad to be hurting for a little bit.\"Yost, the winningest manager in Royals history, is scheduled to have the staples removed next week and follow-up X-rays on his pelvis. The doctors said he'll be off his feet for two or three months  \"For me, it's probably going to be two,\" he said  and then have to undergo physical therapy.Still, he counts himself lucky. The fall could have been fatal, especially if he didn't have a phone.\"It's pretty rough, you know? I'm in quite a bit of pain,\" he said. \"You can imagine, there's no position that's comfortable to be in right now. I don't think I've left this lounge chair since I've been home for more than 5 minutes in two days. Just find a way I can be comfortable and relax, and then try not to move for 10 hours. But by spring training, I should be pretty much full-go.\"",

Beltran is retiring after winning his first World Series title in his 20th major league season. The 40-year-old made the announcement Monday, Nov. 13, 2017, 12 days after the Houston Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)By Kristie Rieken, Associated PressHOUSTON (AP)  It took quite some time, but Carlos Beltran finally got there, winning a World Series title after 20 seasons in the majors.Now he is leaving the Houston Astros and leaving baseball, retiring after a career in which he was a nine-time All-Star and was Rookie of the Year. The 40-year-old designated hitter and outfielder made the announcement Monday, 12 days after the Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series.He announced his retirement in an essay written for The Players' Tribune website. His story touched on what finally winning a championship meant to him.\"I realized early on that my purpose in this game was to share knowledge with younger players and to give back to the game of baseball,\" he wrote. \"I always wanted to do that  that, and be the best teammate I could possibly be. Over 20 years, I feel like I accomplished that.\"So whether we won or lost Game 7, I would have still been happy with my career. But it still feels nice to have a ring,\" he continued.Besides being named an All-Star nine times, most recently in 2016, and the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, he won three Gold Glove and two Silver Slugger awards.His production dropped dramatically this year. He hit .295 with 29 homers and 93 RBIs for the New York Yankees and Texas in 2016. He then batted .231 with 14 homers and 51 RBIs for Houston. Despite that, Beltran's veteran presence and his work with Houston's younger players including Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Marwin Gonzalez proved invaluable for the Astros.\"He was worth every penny for us ... he helped us win in a lot of ways, even though his numbers were not what they were last year, he contributed in a lot of ways that were not really seen by our fans,\" Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow said. \"They were talked about a lot by our players. Also I think people know what I'm talking about. He really was a player-coach for us this year and he contributed in ways that lead me to believe there's no way we win the championship without him this year.\"He finishes with a .279 average, 435 homers, 1,587 RBIs and 312 stolen bases. He also has played for Kansas City, the New York Mets, San Francisco and St. Louis.This season was Beltran's second stint with the Astros, after he was traded to Houston in June 2004. His work that postseason remains one of the best playoff performances in history. He hit .455 with four homers and nine RBIs in an NLDS win over Atlanta, then batted .417 with four more homers and five RBIs before Houston was eliminated by the Cardinals in the NLCS.Beltran appeared in 10 games this postseason, including three in the World Series. He finished with three hits, including two doubles, and an RBI in helping the Astros to their first title.I will always look up to you brother! Thanks for making me a better player and a better person! I'm going to miss you so much! My eyes are getting watery as I type this. Mad love for you  Enjoy retirement #HoF A post shared by Carlos Correa (@teamcjcorrea) on Nov 13, 2017 at 10:16am PSTMany of his current and former teammates expressed their gratitude and appreciation for Beltran on social media after his announcement on Monday. Correa posted a picture of the two of them on Instagram with a caption that read in part: \"I will always look up to you brother! Thanks for making me a better player and a better person! I'm going to miss you so much!\"Congrats to @carlosbeltran15 on an amazing career! We only played together for a short time but what a ride we had! I learned a lot about what being a veteran means and the impact we can have. Youre an amazing teammate and leader. What a way to bow out... a World Champion!  Justin Verlander (@JustinVerlander) November 13, 2017Houston right-hander Justin Verlander tweeted about Beltran's retirement, writing: \"We only played together for a short time but what a ride we had! I learned a lot about what being a veteran means and the impact we can have. You're an amazing teammate and leader. What a way to bow out ... a World Champion!\"Yankees general manager Brian Cashman wouldn't say whether Beltran was a candidate to replace Joe Girardi as his team's manager. But he did rave about his career and the respect he has for him.\"He had leadership qualities, no question about that,\" Cashman said. \"He was someone that people gravitated to in the clubhouse. I think managers or coaches could rely, or front offices could rely on (him), kind of directing things in a positive way or keeping the ship steered in the right direction.\"After what Luhnow saw from Beltran in Houston this season, he could envision him becoming a manager one day.\"Certainly. He's one of the brightest minds I've come across in the game,\" he said. \"Now whether or not, I haven't (spoken) to him about what is intentions are after this, but I think he certainly would be a tremendous asset to any organization in whatever capacity he chooses to contribute.\"",

Phillip)NEW YORK (AP)  Houston second baseman Jose Altuve was voted outstanding player for the second straight season in Players Choice Awards balloting by the Major League Baseball Players Association.Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo was selected Marvin Miller Man of the Year, given to the player who most inspires other players through on-field performances and contributions to his community. Rizzo was treated for limited state classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2008 and in 2012 founded the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation, which funds pediatric cancer research and supports the families of children with cancer.Altuve, who led the Astros to their first World Series championship, also was voted outstanding AL player for the second straight year.

Miami outfielder Giancarlo Stanton was the outstanding NL player, leading the major leagues with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs.Washington right-hander Max Scherzer was picked as the outstanding NL pitcher, going 16-6 with a 2.51 ERA and an NL-leading 268 strikeouts. Cleveland right-hander Corey Kluber was the AL's outstanding pitcher with an 18-4 record and big league-best 2.25 ERA.New York outfielder Aaron Judge was the top AL rookie, setting a major league rookie record with 52 homers. Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger was the top NL rookie, hitting an NL rookie record 39 homers after his late April debut.Washington first baseman Ryan Zimmerman and Kansas City third baseman Mike Moustakas were the top comeback players. After shoulder, wrist, thumb, foot, hamstring and oblique injuries, the 33-year-old Zimmerman hit .303 with 36 homers and 108 RBIs, earning his first All-Star Game selection since 2009. The 29-year-old Moustakas returned from a torn anterior cruciate ligament sustained in May 2016 and hit .272 with 38 homers and 85 RBIs.Balloting among big league players took place on Sept. 19 and results were announced Wednesday.",

Murray and Lendl are calling it quits for a second time, ending a partnership that produced three Grand Slam titles and two Olympic gold medals. (AP Photo/Sarah Ivey, File)By Howard Fendrich, Associated PressAndy Murray and Ivan Lendl are calling it quits for a second time, ending a partnership that produced three Grand Slam titles and two Olympic gold medals.Murray announced Friday on his website that he and Lendl \"have mutually agreed to end their coaching relationship.\"All of Murray's greatest triumphs as a tennis player have come with Lendl guiding him as his coach. That includes, most famously, the Scotsman's 2013 title at Wimbledon, which made him the first British man in 77 years to win the singles championship at the All England Club.Before that, Lendl helped Murray win the 2012 U.S. Open and the gold medal at the London Olympics earlier that year. Then they split in 2014, before reuniting last year, about a month before Murray won his second Wimbledon trophy.Murray also reached No. 1 in the ATP rankings while working with Lendl, getting to that spot for the first time in November 2016.\"I'm thankful to Ivan for all his help and guidance over the years,\" Murray said in the statement on his site. \"We've had great success and learned a lot as a team.\"Lendl, who won eight major titles from 1984 to 1990, and Murray were at the forefront of a trend of players hiring former stars of the sport as coaches.Murray yielded the No. 1 ranking to Rafael Nadal this August, shortly before saying he would miss the rest of the 2017 season because of a hip injury.It turned out his last match of the year came on July 12 at Wimbledon, where his title defense ended with a five-set quarterfinal loss to Sam Querrey.Murray intends to be ready for the start of next season in January, when the Australian Open is played, saying Friday: \"My focus now is on getting ready for Australia with the team I have in place and getting back to competing.\"He plans to enter a tournament in Brisbane, Australia, to prepare for the year's first Grand Slam tournament. Before that, he will train in Miami, as usual.Lendl will continue to work with the U.S. Tennis Association's player development program.\"I wish Andy well going forward,\" Lendl said. \"We had a great run and a lot of fun.\"",

    "text": "Motorsports Danica Patrick to end racing career at next year's Indy 500Danica Patrick cries as she speaks with the media during a news conference before Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series auto race at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Fla., Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. Patrick will end her full-time racing career after running in next year's Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. ( AP Photo/Darryl Graham)By Jenna Fryer, Associated PressHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP)  She started in go-karts when she was 10, and was a national champion two years later. By the time Danica Patrick turned 16, she was on her own in Europe, pursuing a racing career.Patrick was a fearless woman in a sport almost exclusively comprised of male drivers. She raced hard, sparred with her rivals off the track and rarely flinched while becoming one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.Her tough-girl persona almost never cracked in public.When it came time to announce her retirement, with her mother, father, sister, brother-in-law, boyfriend and support team watching from the back of a crowded room at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Friday afternoon, Patrick broke down in tears.\"I feel like this is where my life should be headed, and sometimes we just get kind of nudged there,\" she began. \"Sometimes it's big nudges and sometimes it's little.\"The 35-year-old Patrick paused several times to compose herself to announce that she will race only in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 next year and then she will walk away from a sport where success was elusive even as she grew into a superstar with multiple labels, not the least of which was savvy businesswoman.Patrick has known for at least a month that she will end her career next season at the Indianapolis 500, a decision that will bring her full circle and return her one last time to the storied track that made her famous. Discussing her decision with The Associated Press a few hours before her announcement, Patrick was giddy with excitement and thrilled at the chance to take one more spin around Indianapolis Motor Speedway.Patrick told AP it took her many months to come to the realization her career is all but over. Once she accepted it, she began putting together plans for \"The Danica Double\" over the last several weeks.\"Nothing that was being presented excited me, then about three weeks ago, I just blurted out, 'What about Indy? Let's end it with the Indy 500,'\" she said. \"This ignites something in me. But I am done after May. Everyone needs to put their mind there. My plan is to be at Indy, and then I'm done.\"Patrick would not reveal who she will drive for in either race next year, but Chip Ganassi Racing is the likely ride at Indy. Ganassi has room to field additional cars  he's scaling down from four full-time cars to two next year  and would give Patrick a car capable of winning. Roger Penske and Michael Andretti both have full lineups announced for next year's Indy 500.Patrick will not be driving in the Daytona 500 for Stewart-Haas Racing, team co-owner Tony Stewart told AP. Patrick moved from IndyCar to NASCAR after the 2011 season, and has been racing Cup cars for SHR since 2012. She is being replaced after Sunday's season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway by Aric Almirola.\"I met with her and her agent once,\" Ganassi said. \"I think it is a good idea for her to do, in fact I think it's a great idea. The business-side of the deal still has to work.\"Ganassi already has Cup star Kyle Larson in his camp practically begging for a shot at the Indy 500. Would he enter one-off entries at Indy for both Patrick and Larson?\"I'd have to talk to Larson about that,\" Ganassi smiled.Larson and Patrick are close friends, and he posted on Twitter he was happy for her following her Friday announcement: \"She's done so much for Motorsports. I'm excited for her and her future adventures!! #Namaste.\"Patrick is the only woman to have led laps in both the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. Patrick ran the Indy 500 from 2005 through 2011. Her highest finish was third in 2009, and she was the first woman to lead laps in the race when she paced the field for 19 trips around the Brickyard as a rookie.Patrick was highly marketable early in her career even though wins were rare. She won the pole for the Daytona 500 in 2013, but finished 24th in the standings the last two seasons. She won her only IndyCar race in 2008, in Japan.Sponsorship trouble surfaced this year, too. When no strong opportunities for next season presented itself, Patrick decided to call it a career next Memorial Day weekend.\"I think it's awesome and it will make for a huge month of May that she's back there,\" said Stewart, who spent half of his career trying to win the Indy 500. \"It would be really cool to see her face on the Borg-Warner Trophy, if she can pull that off.\"Patrick had been adamant she would never return to IndyCar or the 500, but changed her mind as she realized her competitive options were dwindling.\"I know I always said I'd never go back to Indy, and I was always being honest,\" she said. \"Well, things change. I know now you can never say never. I'd been going through this in my head and kept asking myself, 'How am I going to get the words out and say it's over?' And trust me, I lost my (stuff) a few times over that.\"But this seems right, and this seems good.\"Patrick told AP she had only informed about 10 people of her decision prior to Friday's announcement. Everyone had been extremely happy with the path she's chosen. She said longtime boyfriend Ricky Stenhouse Jr. \"has never been more excited about something about me in his life.\"Stewart praised Patrick for her time at SHR, and said his team would never have expanded to four cars without her assistance. Kevin Harvick will try to win a second championship in four years for the organization on Sunday, and Stewart said Patrick has been a huge part of the team's success.He was disappointed to learn she's ready to stop driving.\"I am happy that she is doing it on her terms, but I am sad because I feel like there are wins under her belt that she can still get,\" Stewart told AP. \"I thought she'd go road racing or back to IndyCar or something along those lines, because I think that's where she can be successful.\"Patrick's fame was launched in IndyCar, and her relationship with former sponsor GoDaddy made her one of the most recognizable female athletes anywhere, from Super Bowl commercials to race days in the green-and-black firesuit. She has a winery in California, a line of athletic wear and an exercise and fitness program. Patrick said she'll have more time to spend on those ventures after the Indy 500.Her career crossroads was put in motion when GoDaddy left auto racing after 2015, then new sponsor Nature's Bakery was unable to fulfill its three-year commitment to SHR and Patrick. The team pieced together sponsorship all year, but the deal for Almirola next year made Patrick expendable.\"I didn't want to be pushed into anything, and everyone can relate, sometimes things just shift and change around you,\" she told AP. \"Especially with me and the sponsor situation. I've never been there before. I've always had a sponsor. It forces you into thinking about things and nothing was lining up easily. If I don't feel like I can run better than where I am, then I don't want to do it. And, there have been times that I could not have been more miserable.\"That's not why I come, and I feel like it takes away from everything else I accomplished. I don't want to be remembered for the things that didn't go as well. I want to be remembered for the things that went well.\"",

(AP Photo/Petros Karadjias)By Ciaran Fahey, Associated PressBERLIN (AP)  Borussia Dortmund's crisis worsened Friday with a 2-1 loss at promoted Stuttgart, the former leader's fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games.Chadrac Akolo and Josip Brekalo scored early in each half to increase the pressure on Dortmund coach Peter Bosz, whose side hasn't won in the league since September.\"It hurts,\" said Bosz, who remained defiant. \"We're not giving up.'Dortmund played without top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, suspended by the club on Thursday, reportedly for being repeatedly late for training and for inviting a camera crew to the training ground for a marketing exercise.The side got off to a terrible start in Stuttgart when Marc Bartra botched a short back-pass to Roman Buerki. The Spanish defender struck it much too hard, surprising the goalkeeper, allowing Akolo to pounce on the rebound for an easy score to the unguarded net.Dortmund tried everything to recover, but found it difficult to break down Stuttgart's stubborn defense.Mario Goetze almost equalized around the half-hour mark. Andrey Yarmolenko played in Andre Schuerrle, who pulled the ball back for Goetze, but the Germany midfielder was denied by a fine save from Ron-Robert Zieler.Zieler also saved a penalty from Schuerrle before the break, but Maximilian Philipp nipped in to fire in the rebound from a tight angle. It was a deserved equalizer for Dortmund.However, Brekalo scored again with Stuttgart's second shot on goal early in the second half, when the home side might have added more.Yarmolenko thought he'd equalized with a lob but his goal was ruled out for handball in the buildup.Of 15 games at home across two divisions this year, Stuttgart has now won 12 and lost none.Dortmund, which led by five points from Bayern Munich last month, could find itself nine points behind the defending champion on Saturday after Bayern's home game against Augsburg.\"Today we took a step in the right direction but we just weren't rewarded for it,\" said Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer, whose side next faces Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League before playing Schalke in the Ruhr Derby next weekend.",

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)By Tales Azzoni, Associated PressMADRID (AP)  Atletico Madrid's president and club officials looked on as its new Wanda Metropolitano Stadium was blessed in a private pitch-side ceremony this week.Cardinal Carlos Osoro led the blessing which may have come at the right time for Atletico ahead of this weekend's city derby against Real Madrid  with the team needing all the help it can get to overcome its struggles at the new 68,000-capacity home.Diego Simeone's team has only two wins in six games since the Metropolitano was inaugurated this season, losing once and drawing three straight going into Saturday's match.\"We want to win the first ever derby at the Wanda Metropolitano,\" Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann said in an interview with La Liga's website. \"It's a very important match for the fans, for the club. It's a match every player wants to be a part of.\"The inaugural derby at the new stadium could be decisive for the teams' title hopes this season, as Barcelona has already opened a significant advantage at the top of the league standings.The loser this weekend may find itself facing an 11-point deficit against the thriving Catalan club.Barcelona plays at mid-table Leganes on Saturday. Second-place Valencia, four points behind Barcelona and four points in front of both Madrid clubs, plays at Espanyol on Sunday to try to extend its seven-game winning streak in the league.Atletico remains unbeaten in La Liga but has won only two of its last nine matches in all competitions.\"It's been difficult to score goals and to win matches,\" Griezmann said. \"We are solid on defense, we just need to turn things around on offense. We have to keep working hard to try to improve.\"Real Madrid is coming off a home victory over Las Palmas in the league, a result that helped restore order after two consecutive losses sparked a wave of criticism against Zinedine Zidane's team.\"Focused,\" was Cristiano Ronaldo's message on Instagram this week along with a photo of him training for Saturday's match.Atletico got off to a good start after moving from its beloved Vicente Calderon Stadium to the modern Metropolitano on the outskirts of Madrid. It made its debut in the new venue with a 1-0 win against Malaga, and followed it with a 2-0 victory against Sevilla.But things started going wrong when Atletico made its European debut at the stadium in a Champions League match against Chelsea. It scored first but ended losing 2-1 after conceding in the last minute of injury time.In its next league game, Atletico was ahead of Barcelona until late in the match, but conceded an equalizer by Luis Suarez and ended with a disappointing 1-1 draw. It also was held by Villarreal to a 1-1 draw, then endured its worst setback yet  a 1-1 draw against 10-man Qarabag in a result that practically ended its hopes of advancing from the group stage of the Champions League.And with its title chances hanging by a thread in Europe, only a home victory on Saturday may keep Atletico in contention for a significant trophy this season.The team's faithful haven't given up.\"I'm sure that we will eventually have the same success at the new stadium that we used to have at the Calderon,\" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. \"We will see how it goes this weekend, but hopefully there will be a happy ending for us.\"",

    "text": "Football Despite big signings, Cavani emerges as leader of PSG attackPSG's Edinson Cavani celebrates the opening goal during a French League One soccer match Paris-Saint-Germain against Nice at Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, France, Friday, Oct. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Michel Euler)By Jerome Pugmire, Associated PressPARIS (AP)  Paris Saint-Germain broke the bank to buy the world's two most expensive players but its best piece of business may have been not selling Edinson Cavani.While Neymar has been reduced to tears recently amid reports of tensions with PSG coach Unai Emery, the prolific Cavani has emerged as the leader in a star-studded attack.It is now a matter of when, not if, the Uruguayan becomes the club's all-time scorer.Quite some turnaround.Two years ago, Cavani was mercilessly jeered by skeptical fans who wanted him sold. They considered him unworthy of being Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successor when the star striker left to join Manchester United after four goal-packed seasons full of spectacular skill and outrageous strikes.Cavani silenced them with 49 goals in all competitions last season and now, after 17 in 16 matches so far, he needs only 10 to surpass Ibrahimovic's PSG record of 156 goals.That total would have seemed out of sight for Cavani during the tough times. But he has netted 66 in his last 66 games overall.Cavani was regularly whistled at by sections of the PSG crowd, particularly after Ibrahimovic left. They were unhappy PSG had not signed a more illustrious name to replace him.Although they still had Cavani, they preferred to point out his occasionally wasteful finishing rather than see the importance of his wider role within the team.This was hugely unfair on a player who has always worked tirelessly since joining for a then-French record 64 million euros ($68 million) in the summer of 2013, one year after Ibrahimovic joined.Neymar's arrival from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros ($260 million) this summer threatened to relegate Cavani to a secondary role once again.But the opposite has happened.Before the international break, Cavani scored two clinical goals in PSG's 5-0 win away to Angers where  with Neymar rested  he started combining much more with Kylian Mbappe. PSG signed Mbappe from French champion Monaco in a deal worth 180 million euros ($216 million), making the 18-year-old forward the second most expensive transfer behind Neymar. Qatari-owned PSG has been placed under investigation by UEFA for potential breaches of Financial Fair Play rules over these signings.Cavani's performance against Angers revealed his new leadership status, barking orders at teammates and screaming for the ball. It's a far cry from when he would often retreat quietly into his shell when Ibrahimovic was strutting around.And the way Cavani's shots were so cleanly struck on both goals against Angers is indicative of him playing at his best. Cavani is much more efficient when he hits the ball first time, because complications arise when trying to be elaborate or pondering what to do.Because Cavani is not as technically gifted as some strikers, or as nimble, the ball either gets stuck in his feet or he sometimes shoots too hard to compensate. This has led to some embarrassing misses and triggered heavy barracking from fans comparing him unfavorably directly to Ibrahimovic.Cavani was still wasteful at times last season  despite 49 goals  but he seems to have ironed out most flaws.At the age of 30, Cavani is at his peak and could arguably break the 50-goal mark this term. Ibrahimovic hit 50 in his final season.One blip could be Mbappe's near-systematic desire to pass to Neymar, which means that Cavani sometimes gets missed out in attack.Whilst that doesn't matter so much in France, given how easily league leader PSG wins games, it could matter further down the line in the Champions League.Whether Emery addresses that or not could prove crucial, for PSG will need Cavani at his lethal best in the latter stages of the European competition.",

    "text": "Football Tottenham adjusting to change of status in north LondonFILE - This is a Sunday, April 30, 2017 file photo of Tottenham Hotspur's Toby Alderweireld, left, battles for the ball with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud during the north London derby match in English Premier League soccer match between the two teams in north London. Tottenham is heading into a north London derby on Saturday Nov. 18, against Arsenal as a clear favorite for the first time in decades. Tottenham is three places ahead of Arsenal this season and finished above its neighbor last season in the Premier League for the first time since Arsene Wenger took charge of Arsenal in 1996. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant/File)By Steve Douglas, Associated PressIt was a 24-hour period at the start of November that really drove home the reality that Tottenham, after decades of playing second fiddle to Arsenal, was the new dominant force in north London.A day after Tottenham achieved a coming-of-age 3-1 win over European champion Real Madrid in the Champions League in front of more than 80,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal was laboring to a 0-0 draw at home to Red Star Belgrade in the oft-maligned Europa League.Spurs, with a coveted manager and young, exciting team, were suddenly the talk of European soccer. That used to be the case at Arsenal, but no more.It's why the two rivals find themselves in an unusual position heading into the north London derby on Saturday. For what seems like the first time in decades, Tottenham is widely regarded as a clear favorite even though the match is taking place at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.Tottenham finished above Arsenal in the Premier League last season  the first time that had happened since Wenger took charge of Arsenal in 1996  and is three places and four points ahead of Arsenal after 11 games of this season.Throw in Tottenham's progress in the Champions League, and the shift in power is clear.Wenger won't accept it, however.\"No, not at all,\" he said, when asked if he thought Arsenal will be the underdog on Saturday. \"I think Tottenham are a good side but we have the quality to win this game and that's what we want to show.\"The conclusion of people will be the comparison of the two performances on Saturday. We have a good opportunity to show we are the strongest, so let's do it.\"Moments earlier at the news conference Thursday, Wenger had interrupted a reporter who pointed out that Arsenal had dominated Tottenham for a \"long time.\"\"For 20 years,\" Wenger said, before smiling.It shouldn't be forgotten that it was Arsenal which ended last season with a trophy  the FA Cup  and Tottenham's critics argue that Mauricio Pochettino's team need to win silverware as a form of validation of its progress. That might not happen this season.Tottenham, which finished third and second in the last two seasons of the Premier League, is already eight points behind first-place Manchester City and is out of the English League Cup.Pochettino, who hasn't been on the losing side in six meetings with Arsenal as Tottenham manager, accepted that history does count when assessing the relative merits of the sides.\"In the last 22, 23 years, we have only finished above Arsenal one time,\" Pochettino said Thursday. \"So that does not mean today we are above Arsenal. We must respect them. They were great (in the) Arsene Wenger era, and I think for us it's a massive challenge to stay there and to be competitive against a team that, in the last 20 years, wins more trophies than us.\"Pochettino had mixed news on the injury front, saying that Toby Alderweireld might be out until January because of a hamstring problem but that Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Harry Winks and Hugo Lloris had returned to training after injury.Kane has scored in his last five games against Arsenal.Arsenal will be without injured striker Olivier Giroud, while Wenger has to decide whether to recall Alexandre Lacazette to the team after leaving the France international out of two big games this season already, at Liverpool and Man City.Lacazette has only completed 90 minutes once since his summer arrival from Lyon.",

    "text": "Football Dortmund desperate to get back on track in BundesligaDortmund players leave the pitch after the Champions League Group H soccer match between APOEL Nicosia and Borussia Dortmund at GSP stadium, in Nicosia, Cyprus, on Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017. (AP Photo/Petros Karadjias)By Ciaran Fahey, Associated PressFRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  Borussia Dortmund's best start to the Bundesliga is all but forgotten amid the turmoil of failing to win in the league since September and its suspension on Thursday of top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Aubameyang was dropped from the squad for the trip to Stuttgart on Friday for what it said were \"disciplinary reasons,\" without giving further details.The Gabon forward's suspension adds to the sense of strife at Dortmund, which slumped to three defeats in four games without a win having previously led the league.The club had been hoping that another start after the international break would bring a badly needed change of fortune to stay on new leader Bayern Munich's tail and maintain its championship challenge.\"You're against the wind when you don't win,\" Dortmund coach Peter Bosz said before Aubameyang's suspension was made known. \"But it's a challenge for me to turn it around. We'll find our way back up again.\"Dortmund was five points ahead of Bayern last month. Now six points behind Bayern, in third place.The tables turned when Dortmund lost its 41-game unbeaten run at home to Leipzig, and Bayern appointed Jupp Heynckes for his fourth stint as coach. With the exception of a German Cup rout of Magdeburg, Dortmund hasn't won any games since. Meanwhile, Heynckes has led Bayern on a seven-game winning streak across all competitions, including the 3-1 win in Dortmund in the last round before the break.\"Not only the results, but also the way of playing displeased me,\" Bosz said. He took over from Thomas Tuchel in the offseason and has had to incorporate seven new arrivals into the team: Andrey Yarmolenko, Maximilian Philipp, Omer Toprak, Mahmoud Dahoud, Jadon Sancho, Jeremy Toljan and Dan-Axel Zagadou.Bosz had a brilliant start to the league with six wins and a draw from seven games with a goal difference of plus 19. Dortmund's players thrived on the former Ajax coach's swashbuckling style of football.But the team's defensive frailties were there to see long before it started losing - first to Tottenham in the Champions League, where Real Madrid added another defeat.The side nevertheless kept winning in the Bundesliga and avoided conceding until the sixth round, where Lars Stindl scored Borussia Moenchengladbach's consolation of sorts in a 6-1 rout.Leipzig burst the bubble with a 3-2 defeat of Dortmund on Oct. 14 in a game that either side could have won. The aura of confidence was gone and Dortmund never recovered.The international break came at the right time for the club, offering coach and players some respite and a chance to look at what's been going wrong. Top players like Christian Pulisic, Shinji Kagawa, and Aubameyang stayed with the team instead of departing for international duty.\"We could train in this break with 12 or 13 first-team players instead of the usual four or five. That's why I'm feeling optimistic,\" Bosz said.Friday's game in Stuttgart starts a busy week with Tottenham visiting in the Champions League on Tuesday, then bitter rival Schalke for the Ruhr derby the following weekend.Now suspended, Aubameyang failed to score in any of his last five games. He hardly featured against Bayern  which hosts Augsburg on Saturday  while his lackluster performances in two games against APOEL in the Champions League also brought criticism.\"Auba has scored quite a lot, unfortunately just in training,\" '' Bosz joked this week.The Dutch coach is boosted by the return to fitness of Germany forward Andre Schuerrle, while Raphael Guerreiro and Marco Reus are still working on their comebacks.Stuttgart, promoted as second division champion last season, has conceded only one goal in five home games on its return to the Bundesliga. The side won four of those games and drew the other.\"Stuttgart is very well organized defensively and doesn't allow many chances,\" Bosz said. \"It won't be an easy task. We'll only be successful if we perform as a real team and enforce our style of play 100 percent.\"Another setback would call Bosz's position into question.",

(Oleg Shalmer)ZURICH (AP)  Russia will be the lowest-ranked team in the draw for the World Cup it is hosting after Peru sealed the last qualifying spot.FIFA uses its October rankings for the Dec. 1 draw in Moscow, which means No. 65 Russia is two places below Saudi Arabia, which will be lowest-ranked nation in the pot of fourth-seeded teams.Despite the rankings, Russia will be the top seed in Group A  the status FIFA gives all World Cup host nations.The No. 10-ranked Peru clinched the last place in the 32-team tournament when it beat No. 122 New Zealand in an intercontinental playoff late Wednesday in Lima.Peru's win pushed No. 38 Serbia down into the fourth-seeded pot as a dangerous outlier. Serbia is likely to be drawn in a tough group with Brazil or Argentina, the only top-seeded teams from outside Europe.FIFA limits each of the four-team groups to a maximum of two European teams. No two teams from any other continental confederation can be drawn togetherPotentially tough draws could group Brazil, Spain, Egypt and Serbia, and Germany with England, Costa Rica and Nigeria.FIFA has changed how it allocates teams in the draw and now uses rankings alone for all four pots. At previous World Cups, only pot 1 was for seeded teams, and the other three pots were decided by a geographical spread.Russia will play the tournament opener on June 14. The 2018 World Cup final will be held on July 15.

(AP Photo/Moises Castillo)By John Pye, Associated PressSYDNEY (AP)  Ange Postecoglou ensured his Australian team qualified for the World Cup. He's just not quite sure if he'll make the trip to Russia with them next year.Speculation has been mounting over Postecoglou's future as Australia's head coach since media reports emerged during the Asian playoff series against Syria that he may not remain in the job, even if his team qualified.Despite ushering the Socceroos past Syria and the intercontinental playoff against Honduras, clinched with a 3-1 win in Sydney on Wednesday, the 52-year-old Postecoglou wouldn't remained not committal  at least publicly  about his future.\"Right now it's about enjoying the moment,\" he said. \"What happens beyond here can be picked up,\" later.Planning for the World Cup \"is pretty much in place (and) we don't have another game until March,\" Postecoglou added. \"From that perspective, there's nothing of real urgency. The draw is the next marker.\"The State Kremlin Palace in Moscow will host the 32-team draw on Dec. 1.Captain Mile Jedinak got Australia in front against Honduras with a deflected free kick in the 54th minute, and calmly converted two subsequent penalties to guarantee Australia's place in a fourth consecutive World Cup. The home-and-away series ended 3-1 with Honduras scoring in injury time in Sydney, well after the 77,060-strong crowd at Sydney's Olympic stadium started the celebrations.Postecoglou took over as head coach in late 2013, replacing German coach Holger Osieck, after Australia qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. His relatively inexperienced squad performed credibly despite not winning a game in a group containing 2010 champion Spain, the Netherlands and Chile.The Greek-born former Australian international then steered the Socceroos to the Asian Cup title in 2015, and through 22 games in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.\"It's just overwhelming I guess,\" Postecoglou said of his emotions around finally securing a spot in Russia. \"When you're coaching your national team, there's an extra layer and burden of responsibility there  knowing what it means to the nation and to these players. It's been 22 hard games  you just want them to get reward for it.\"But his perseverance with what he called an Australian style has received mixed reviews domestically. Critics have questioned his defensive system; while a lack of quality finishing saw his team narrowly missing out on direct qualification on goals difference.Postecoglou will take time to debrief with the players and his wife and family, before meeting with Football Federation Australia and deciding whether or not to continue.\"It's the hardest thing I've ever done, these last four years  where our starting point was, having gone to a World Cup with a rookie squad and then knowing we pretty much had to win the Asian Cup (on home soil),\" he said. \"While I've got a thick skin, (my family members) have got to cop what I've been copping and it's unfair on them. Tonight is about enjoying it and hopefully seeing their smiling faces.\"",

Italy coach Gian Piero Ventura has been fired Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017 following the Azzurri's failure to qualify for the World Cup. Ventura leaves in disgrace, widely criticized for his tactical decisions that left Italy out of football's biggest competition for the first time in six decades. A football federation statement says Ventura is \"no longer coach of the national team.\" (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)By Andrew Dampf, Associated PressROME (AP)  Two days after Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup, the head of the country's football federation fired national coach Gian Piero Ventura  while ignoring angry calls to quit his own job.Ventura left in disgrace Wednesday, widely criticized for his tactical decisions that left Italy out of football's biggest competition for the first time in six decades.\"I spoke with Ventura today and told him that his services are no longer needed,\" federation president Carlo Tavecchio said in a brief statement to reporters, adding that he would propose a series of reforms to improve the country's most popular sport.Four-time champion Italy lost a playoff to Sweden, 1-0 on aggregate, on Monday.Ventura's contract was recently extended to 2020 but the deal included a stipulation that it could be voided in case of a failed qualification.Carlo Ancelotti, who was fired by Bayern Munich in September, was being mentioned by Italian media as a likely replacement but no new coach was immediately named.\"We also thought about some important coaches and we'll try to possibly sign one of them,\" Tavecchio said.Damiano Tommasi, president of the Italian players association, abandoned a summit called to assess the failed qualification once he understood that Tavecchio would not step down.\"We believe we've got to start the rebuilding process with elections,\" Tommasi said. \"It doesn't seem like there's any desire to restart from zero.\"The problems of Italian football can't be resolved with just the firing of the national team coach,\" added Tommasi, who played for Italy and helped Roma win the 2001 Serie A title. \"Otherwise we'll continue to re-mix the same minestrone that has caused indigestion for so many of us.\"Tavecchio said he called a board meeting for Monday to present his reforms, adding that they will affect the domestic leagues.Ventura was hired last year when Antonio Conte left the national team to coach Chelsea after the European Championship.The 69-year-old Ventura was a journeyman coach who had never managed a major club.He previously coached Udinese, Cagliari, Napoli, Messina, Hellas Verona, Pisa, Bari and Torino.Ventura's attachment to two forwards he coached at Torino, Ciro Immobile and Andrea Belotti, and his refusal to try a three-striker formation, led him to continually leave Napoli winger Lorenzo Insigne on the bench.Considered Italy's most talented player of the moment, Insigne was inexplicably asked to come on for Marco Verratti in a central midfield position late in the opening leg against Sweden.Ventura leaves with a record of nine wins, four draws and three losses.Ancelotti, who coached Juventus and AC Milan before going abroad to win titles with Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern, has the big-club resume that Ventura lacked. But it remains to be seen if he'll be willing to coach the national team, or if he still prefers the daily activities of a club.Other options include installing a caretaker and luring back Conte, or perhaps Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri or Zenit St. Petersburg's Roberto Mancini once the club season ends.\"Ancelotti is definitely a great coach and a great person. He would be a great choice,\" said Italian coaches association president Renzo Ulivieri, who participated in the summit. \"But other considerations need to be made. We need to talk with him and look around. It's early to talk about coaches.\"Tavecchio's status was also brought into question by Italian Olympic Committee president Giovanni Malago on Tuesday.\"It's up to the boss to take responsibility but if I were him I would resign,\" Malago, who oversees all sports in the country, said Tuesday.There is a precedent since both Giancarlo Abete, the previous federation president, and coach Cesare Prandelli each resigned immediately after Italy was eliminated in the first round of the 2014 World Cup.Tavecchio was first voted to succeed Abete in 2014 despite a racist comment during his election campaign.UEFA banned Tavecchio for six months after he made a reference to bananas when discussing the presence of foreign players in Italy.Tavecchio was re-elected to another four-year term in March.",

Dempsey, who missed the rest of the 2016 season with a heart condition, has been named the MLS Comeback Player of the Year after scoring 12 goals in the 2017 regular season and leading Seattle to a second-place finish in the MLS Western Conference.

(AP)  Inside Clint Dempsey's chest sits a monitor that is constantly collecting data. That data then gets transmitted so doctors can scrutinize the results and make sure that Dempsey's heart  the one that nearly derailed his career more than a year ago  is functioning properly.Dempsey has gotten past worrying about the irregular heartbeat that sidelined him last year. He no longer sits around waiting to feel an unnatural beat. The only time he thinks about it is when someone brings it up.A full season of playing back at an elite level has eased Dempsey's concerns.\"I just think I got more comfortable, more confident, not thinking about it too much,\" Dempsey told The Associated Press in an interview this week. \"It's always kind of a weird thing when you come back from an injury, especially with your heart. You're always listening, feeling at night, thinking about it when you're training and then making sure you're having normal beats and stuff like that and checking on it. You just come to a point where you're not thinking about it as much and that's when you kind of get over it.\"Dempsey was named the MLS Comeback Player of the Year on Wednesday, acknowledging his play in a season where he again became the leading scorer for the Seattle Sounders and reclaimed a place on the U.S. national team. The Americans fell short in World Cup qualifying, ending Dempsey's bid to play in a fourth World Cup.Federico Higuain of Columbus and Erick Torres of Houston were the other finalists.Dempsey had 12 goals in the MLS regular season and added two more in Seattle's conference semifinal victory over Vancouver. He'll be at the center of attention next week when the Sounders open the Western Conference finals against Houston.The conference finals come a year after Dempsey could only watch during Seattle's run to an MLS Cup title, and his own future as a soccer player was in question.\"Everything is good. As far as I know everything is good. I still have a chip, a monitor inside my chest that sends data back to the doctors so they can see if there are any irregularities and so far everything has been good. I'll probably keep it in for another year,\" Dempsey said.Dempsey is still hesitant to go into details about his condition. He emphasizes it was not life-threatening but it was life-altering. There were moments when his heart would be beating at a more rapid pace than it should for the amount of exertion. That was the trigger that eventually led to numerous examinations and ultimately two procedures, one of which was to install the monitor.Even after he was cleared to return, Dempsey said it was a few months into the MLS season before he started to feel normal again.\"I probably really didn't start feeling really good until I'd say May, June. That's when I started feeling like my numbers were where they used to be,\" Dempsey said. \"Early in the season we were looking at the numbers in March and April and they really weren't where I used to be. I could feel the difference as well, but you could also see it in the numbers.\"Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said he felt bad for having to lean on Dempsey early in the season when Seattle got off to a slow start.\"I had to play Clint almost every game. I didn't really get a chance to give him a day off here, a day off there. He was doing whatever he could to help the team,\" Schmetzer said.This season has proven so positive for Dempsey there's discussions about a new contract with Seattle. The Sounders can exercise an option on Dempsey for next season but it's not friendly to the team's salary structure. A new deal could be more beneficial for the team and all but ensure Dempsey finishes his career in Seattle.\"You'd like to stick around,\" Dempsey said. \"The club has been great to me. They stood by me during all the heart issues and stuff like that. It's been a great place to play. I would definitely love to end my career here.\"",

    "text": "Football Jedinak stars as Australia qualifies for 2018 World CupAustralia's Mile Jedinak scores a goal against Honduras during their World Cup soccer playoff deciding match in Sydney, Australia, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Daniel Munoz)JOHN PYE, AP Sports WriterSYDNEY (AP)  Mile Jedinak didn't miss when it counted, propelling Australia into next year's World Cup with three goals in Wednesday's 3-1 intercontinental playoff victory over Honduras.The Australia captain was in doubt for the series with a groin injury that had forced him to miss end of the Asian qualifying campaign, when his team narrowly missed out on direct entry to the tournament in Russia.But Jedinak played a full game in the 0-0 draw in San Pedro Sula last Friday and, aided by the state-of-the-art rehabilitation program on Australia's charter flight home, took the free kick that broke the scoring drought in the 54th minute at Sydney's Olympic stadium.His free kick curled to the left of the wall and deflected sharply in off defender Henry Figueroa, bringing the parochial 77,060-strong crowd at Sydney's Olympic stadium to life.He converted from the spot in the 72nd after referee Nestor Pitana penalized Bryan Acosta for a hand ball and again calmly slotted home another penalty after Robbie Kruse was dragged down in the area in the 85th to ensure Australia qualified for its fourth consecutive World Cup.\"I'll take them all,\" Jedinak said. \"It wouldn't have mattered who scored. I'm happy to chip in.\"Honduras scored a consolation goal deep in injury time in a scramble in front of goal with Alberth Elis and Maynor Figueroa both swiping at the ball from close range.The result meant Asia got a full quota of five teams into the World Cup in Russia, with 31 of the 32 places decided. Peru was hosting New Zealand for the last spot later Wednesday.Under-fire coach Ange Postecoglou said he was delighted for his team, and declined to comment on his future with the Socceroos amid speculation that he may not stay on for the World Cup.\"They got what they deserved  it wasn't by luck or by chance,\" Postecoglou said. \"They believed in something that we started, and right to the end they displayed the kind of resilience and belief that has made me proud all the way along. They did it their way, and got great rewards for it.\"While the Australians invested heavily in the charter flight to get home Sunday after the first leg, the Honduras squad took a commercial flight and arrived a day later.But with veteran skipper Maynor Figueroa returning, and with Elis adding pace on the flank, Honduras lifted its tempo in the first half and frustrated the Australian attack.Honduras coach Jorge Luis Pinto said the Australians clearly worked to neutralize Elis out wide, and the momentum shift was too great after the opening goal.\"Australia were very strong and aggressive and put pressure on us. In the first half the game was more balanced  in the second half, the (first) goal took a toll,\" Pinto said. \"The second goal, there was contact with the player's hand, but it wasn't intentional.\"Honduras earned a playoff spot with a 3-2 win over Mexico on a hectic last day of qualifying in North and Central America and the Caribbean, securing fourth spot and ensuring the U.S. missed out.Australia advanced after beating Syria for fifth place in Asian qualifying, with veteran Tim Cahill scoring twice in Sydney, and setting up the intercontinental playoff.Cahill was involved when Australia edged Uruguay on penalties in a playoff in 2005 to qualify for the following year's World Cup in Germany. He was also there when the Australians qualified directly from Asia for 2010 and 2014. There is a good chance he'll be in Russia, too, even after he has turned 38.The final word went to the jubilant Jedinak, a veteran midfielder who plays for Aston Villa in England.\"We got the job done and that's all that matters  it's going to be a big 2018,\" he said.",

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)ANDREW DAMPF, AP Sports WriterROME (AP)  Call them Italy's \"lost generation.\"The Azzurri's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup means that a good portion of the squad's players will not have appeared in football's premier tournament by the time they approach their 30s.Winger Alessandro Florenzi will be 31 by the time the next World Cup rolls around. Center forward Andrea Belotti will be 28, as will playmaker Federico Bernardeschi and striker Domenico Berardi.Daniele Rugani and Alessio Romagnoli  the next installment of Italy's vaunted center backs  will also be approaching their late 20s.The 2022 tournament in Qatar will be held in late November and December, meaning it's more than five full years away.If current form is anything to go by, it's no certainty that Italy will qualify.The four-time champion failed to reach next year's World Cup in Russia after going out 1-0 on aggregate to Sweden in a qualifying playoff on Monday.It's the first World Cup Italy has missed in six decades.Captain Gianluigi Buffon, defender Andrea Barzagli and midfielder Daniele De Rossi each announced their retirements from the national team after the playoff loss. They were the last remaining members from the squad that won Italy's last World Cup in 2006.Buffon, Barzagli and De Rossi were planning to hand over their expertise to the next generation in Russia. But their plans got cut short.So Gianluigi Donnarumma, AC Milan's 18-year-old starter, will take over from Buffon in Italy's goal without ever having traveled to a major tournament.Giorgio Chiellini, another veteran center back, may retire also. If so, it will leave Rugani and Romagnoli with the keys to the defense and only Leonardo Bonucci to turn to for guidance.Italy has historically been relucatant to use younger players despite a trend in that direction, as evidenced by the recent success of a young Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup.Anthony Martial and Kingsley Coman were both 20 when they helped France reach the final of last year's European Championship and 18-year-old Kylian Mbappe and 20-year-old Ousmane Dembele are also now key members of Didier Deschamps' squad.By contrast, players like Bernardeschi, Rugani (both at Juventus) and Romagnoli (AC Milan) have struggled for playing time with their clubs.\"Italian football's year zero was five or six years ago but few realized it,\" Italy's under-21 coach Luigi Di Biagio said. \"Now comes this glaring result and everyone starts shouting.\"But when we were talking about younger players not finding space in their squads we weren't making an argument for our national team, but for the good of everyone.\"Napoli winger Lorenzo Insigne made one brief appearance at the 2014 World Cup and is now widely considered Italy's most talented player. But he was largely left on the bench by coach Gian Piero Ventura in the playoff loss.To the consternation of many, the 26-year-old Insigne came on for Marco Verratti in a central midfield role late in the opening leg against Sweden.It was widely considered a tactical blunder by Ventura and further underlined Italy's malaise.\"It's useless to call up Insigne to make him play out of position,\" Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis said. \"This is how the international spotlight transforms into something negative and how our jewels don't become utilized.\"___AP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed.___Find more World Cup coverage at https://apnews.com/tag/WorldCup___Andrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf",

The slim, smooth playing Filipino became the Bottledeck.net 77th World 14.1 Champion, and doing so in fashion by defeating none other than the king of straight pool, Thorsten Hohmann of Germany.The week long event was challenging with Corteza playing a total of 13 matches and pocketing almost 2000 balls. Hohmann had pocketed over 1700 shots. The World 14.1 title is perhaps the most hard earned title in billiards with no luck or short cuts in winning games.Day 6 which took place the day before the finals saw the quarter-finalists duel it out for a place in the semi's. Top American 14.1 specialist Danny Harriman had defeated 2012 World 14.1 Champion John Schmidt in the final 12, but fell 200-111 to the powerful Darren Appleton of the UK. Newcomer Del Sim of Scotland had his dream run through the field finally ended by a fellow Scotsman Jonni Fulcher 200-105. USA's hopeful Max Eberle of Las Vegas was 8-0 undefeated until he ran into the buzzsaw in Lee Van Corteza 200-44 where he had very few opportunities.The most thrilling match of the day was reigning champion Mika Immonen of Finland versus Thorsten Hohmann. Leading 184-88, Immonen went for an aggressive bank and then played a mediocre safe. The minute error seemed innocent to an ordinary 14.1 pro, but Hohmann proved why he is the greatest straight pool player on the planet as he ran 112 and out to advance to his 6th World 14.1 semi-finals.\"One bad safe and he made me pay dearly. Good shooting Thorsten\", commented Mika on his social media.The semi-finals first pitted Appleton versus Hohmann which would be the third time the two champions faced each other in the World 14.1. In the match, neither could get things going but it was Appleton who made the most errors opening up Hohmann for the win making him 3-0 versus Appleton in World 14.1 competition.\"I haven't played in three months, so I wasn't really expecting a big result. That's why I continued my high run the other day after the match. To shake off the rust\", said Appleton. He ran a 268 unofficially after his 100 point game with Michael Yednak in the round robin.In the other semi-finals, Fulcher and Corteza both struggled. The beginning of the match saw both players consecutively foul in a defense battle that saw the score in the negatives for the first 45 minutes of play. After one hour, neither player had even 1 rack in the positive scoring.Eventually Corteza pulled away and sat at a comfortable 70 ball lead needing less than 3 racks to win. Fulcher was determined and clawed his way back to within only 2 racks from tying Corteza. A costly scratch put Lee Van back at the table, and then he missed an easy 7-ball which ended up banking and fluking back into the called pocket. The good fortune was huge and the first and only lucked in shot of all the TV matches. Unfortunately for Fulcher, this sealed his fate with Corteza running out the rest of the match for a 200-145 win.In the finals, this was the third time in history that Asia versus Europe matched. Previously, Francisco Bustamante and Efren Reyes of the Philippines had came short against their western opponents for the World 14.1 title. Lee Van intended to change that. In his first try no less, as this was his first appearance at the World 14.1.The finals was a race to 300 points with a 30 minute intermission at 150 points. Hohmann was the dominant player in the first half of the match and held a sizable lead after his 83 ball run. He stood at 146-78 lead over Corteza.But by the second half of the match, Corteza came back with his own 60 ball runs . Helped by uncharacteristic misses by Hohmann on routine shots, Corteza kept extending his lead. Hohmann returned to the table 2 more times but could not put together any significant runs, and at 217-183, he relinquished the table the final time with Corteza running 83 and out for the championship win. Ironically, equaling Hohmann's high run of the match.\"Of course I would have loved to win another World 14.1, but Lee Van played great. He deserves the win\" said Hohmann.\"I just tried to stay focused. Straight pool takes a lot of concentration. I'm happy to be the first Asian to win the World 14.1\" said Lee Van. Corteza also held the high run for this year's event at 130. Hohmann had the second highest at 112.On his Facebook Corteza wrote:\"Wow!!! The first asian to win since 1912 according to history! Can't contain my happiness in winning this 14.1 title. Thank you to my ever supportive Steinway family Manny Stamatakis Anna Nikolakakos Nikolakakos GeorgiosZion Zvi Patrick Diveney Ryotaro Horiuchi Gil castillo leather goods , Joe Gonzales for the nice photos thanks to Charlie Williams and to everyone who made a major part in organizing this 77th World 14.1 championship event. And also a great honor for me to play the finals with the four time champion and a gentleman Thorsten Hohmann. Thanks everyone for the congratulations. To my family and fellow Filipinos this is for you guys!TO GOD BE THE GLORY\"",

I'm the World 14.1 Champion and it is just such a huge honor.\" - Mika Immonen (Photo courtesy of Joseph Ratke)New York City- It seems only fitting that two adopted New Yorkers play for the World 14.1 Title on the 15th Anniversary of 9/11. Mika Immonen is from Finland, but he has resided in NYC for over 15 years. And Earl Strickland, who hails from North Carolina, has lived in New York for about five years now.In the end, it was Immonen who was able to sigh a deep breath of relief.\"Between the nerves and 6 hours of play, I was shaking. I have to admit I was more of afraid of losing in the finals again then thinking of the joys of winning\", admitted Immonen. \"But I now have this huge weight off my shoulders finally. I can't believe it. I'm the World 14.1 Champion and it is just such a huge honor.\"Immonen, age 43, was inducted into the BCA HOF in 2014 while Strickland, age 55, gained entry in 2006. Both players have been at the top of the pool world for so long that they have become one name icons of the sport  if you say Mika or Earl, everyone knows who you are talking about.THE FIRST HALFImmonen won the lag, Strickland broke, Immonen missed a long combo, and Strickland was off and running as he quickly cleared the first rack. But then he missed the break shot, setting in motion an uncharacteristic series of misses that would plague him throughout the first half of the match.Immonen did run the second rack, but he missed the stack on his break shot and, after a safety battle, Strickland made a few balls, then ran 31 and now led, 53-13. But he missed another break shot and Immonen ran 48 to forge ahead, 61-53. Strickland managed to run 15, but missed again. Immonen ran 23 but got stuck on the stack, played an intentional foul, and now led, 83-65.Strickland managed to make only three balls before missing for the fourth time. Immonen responded with a run of 52 before his key ball skidded. Strickland ran 12, but missed. Immonen managed to run four before getting stuck on the stack on a break shot. But after he played a poor safety, Strickland missed his first shot and Immonen ran 44 balls before committing a foul  so at the break he led by a score of 180-80.SECOND HALFThe 30 minute intermission was just what the doctor ordered for Strickland as he came back with a vengeance, running 57 balls to narrow the gap  the score: 192-137. After his miss, Immonen ran 20, then made a huge error by failing to make contact with a ball near the jaws of the side pocket. So, with the score now 199-137, Strickland went back to work, running 61 balls before missing a ball on a skid and scratching in the side.He caught the ball before it went it, so he lost 16 more points  1 for the scratch, 15 for the penalty. The net result was that Immonen now led, 200-182 and was at the table with a break shot after making the final ball.Immonen ran a rack, but jawed a close to the rail break shot and Strickland ran 32 before missing. The score was now tied at 214. But Immonen then ran 38 to take a 252-214 lead, but he failed to get shape on his break shot, so a safety battle ensued. The proceeding included several intentional fouls and three in a row by Immonen. At this point the score was 235-212.Strickland put together a run of 48 then missed, but he was now leading, 260-236. Immonen came back with a run of 21 but got stuck on the rack and a safety battle took place. After several intentional fouls and short runs the score was 285 to 260 in Immonen's favor. Strickland ran 10 balls, but missed a break shot and Immonen struggled through the last 15 balls to win the six hour marathon, 300-270.",

They made a great comeback and put us under pressure again.But we also showed a lot of heart too to comeback in this match when we were down 3-2 then tie the match at 3-3 and get some significant rack from there, added the two-time world champion.Team Asia skipper Efren Bata Reyes said that they just ran out of luck in the end as their shots went sour.Minamalas lang kami ng konti, said the 61-year-old pool legend. Masama ang mga tira ng mga kasama ko ngayon kaya ninenerbyos rin ako. Kaya pati ako sumasama na rin ang tira ko.Englands Darren Appleton is the fourth member of Team West.Each team played in singles, doubles, 3-on-3 and 4-on-4 matches in this race-to-10, 3-day tournament.Team West went off to a blazing start and took a 4-2 advantage in opener last Thursday and kept their hold of the lead in the Day Two after splitting the six matches of the tie with Team Asia.Another hot start in the final playdate pushed Team West at the brink of taking the crown, 9-6, and went a rack closer to claim the title in the 4-on-4 match.But Team Asia had a different script.Down 0-4 after some strings of dry breaks and missed pockets, Team Asia found an opening in the fifth rack to mount a comeback. The host squad took advantage of a crucial miss of Immonen on the No. 9-ball in the corner pocket in the eighth frame as Reyes and Bustamante cleaned the table for the equalizer.Reyes had a dry break in the ninth rack but a No. 4-ball miss by Appleton was all Team Asia needed to steal a come-from-behind win.Pin Yi edged Ouschan in the next singles match, 5-3, to cut Team Asias tie deficit to 8-9.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

This is a team contest so having good communication with your team is important, said Team West captain Finnish Mika Immonen, a two time world champion.Immonen will team up with American Shane Van Boening, Briton Daren Appleton and Austrian Albin Ouschan.Team Asia skipper Reyes said that though communication could be a challenge, they will bank on each others skill and strategy to bag the crown in the three-day, 10-ball race-to-10 team tournament format.Magagaling naman itong mga kasangga ko. Kaya matibay na rin itong team namin, said the 61-year-old Reyes.Yes that could be true, Imonnen countered referring to Team Asia banking more on their individual skills on the table.

When asked about the level of challenge Asia would bring in team competition Mika replied, \" Oh yeah, its going be tougher than playing any USA team we ever faced. The talent is not as deep anymore in the USA, I think that's obvious from the last decade of Mosconi Cups. So its going to be tougher. This will be the most concentrated talent of players ever assembled. It's going to be exciting and nerve racking. Amazing pool for sure.\"\"Mika Immonen is the most experienced pool player on the team. It's not just about all the wins he has had, which are countless, but all the losses,too. He's gone through some of the toughest losses in the sport. But has always come back stronger than ever. That's why he is on the team, and that's why we feel he will be a great leader\", said Charlie Williams, Dragon Promotions Executive Producer of the Kings Cup.Williams adds, \"Believe it or not, he turned down the position of captain at first and I needed to sway him!\"\"Yes, that's true\", Mika admits. \"The first thing I said was that I don't know if I deserved to be captain. Or if I wanted that responsibility. But Charlie convinced me. I did realize that I have a good track record in team events. The Patriot Cup, Mosconi Cup, World Cup of Pool were all events I have won. I learned a lot from Johan Ruysink and Oliver Ortmann playing under them for Team Europe. I'm confident I'll gather all those experiences and put something together that will work for us.\"\"Plus going against Efren Reyes as captain is an obvious honor and challenge in itself.\"Immonen has been named MVP in multiple major pro team competitions. Besides that, Immonen is one of the most successful players in the world, and arguably the most successful player in European history. He was voted Player of the Decade by Billiards Digest, and has won the World 9-Ball Championship, the World 10-Ball Championship, and the first European of only two, to have won back to back US Open Championships. Immonen has also won major titles in numerous Asian countries including the Korea International Championships, the All Japan Championships, the Philippines Open. Immonen was also inducted into the billiards Hall of Fame, only the second European to ever received the honor.Mika has been one of the most recognizable figures in the sport and a top sports star in Finland.\"Winning many events here in the Philippines in the past will definitely come in handy. The crowd can be a big factor, so maybe we can win some of the crowd to our side\", said Immonen. \" But I have a good track record there and I'm comfortable in that environment.\"Fans are highly anticipating the final selections. The Captains are,too.\"It's a very interesting format for me. And I have interesting feelings playing with an American on our team. But I think it's going to be fun to be on the same side.\" As far as who would be the one player Mika would pick if he could, to be on his Euro-USA squad?\"Darren Appleton. He's been the most solid player in recent years and has no weaknesses.\"",

    "text": "Billiards Efren Reyes Named Captain of Asia in Kings CupThe most successful and decorated player in the history of Asia & possibly the world will lead the East vs Europe/USA on November 19-21st.Manila, Philippines- The most successful and decorated player in the history of Asia, possibly the world, will lead the East against Europe/USA on November 19-21st. Efren \"Bata\" Reyes has been chosen as Captain of Team Asia and will lead them against the West in what surely will become the most epic rivalry in cue sports.\"Who else could be better than the greatest player of all time? Efren Reyes has a big track record of success in team events. And he's going to have an amazing supporting cast. The West will have their hands full\", said Charlie Williams, Dragon Promotions Executive Producer of the Kings Cup.\"Being named captain of Asia is a big responsibility. But I know our Asia team players are all really good, so it's going to be a joint effort together\", said Reyes.Efren Reyes has a pedigree that is unmatched by any player in Asia. He has won the World 9-Ball Championship, World Bank Pool, World One Pocket, US Open, and numerous Asian Games and SEA Games gold medals. He has also excelled in team play and won such events as the World Mixed Doubles and World Cup of Pool. He is widely regarded by other professionals as the biggest genius that the sport of billiards has ever seen.\"I've learned so much from Efren who has always been my idol. He has been a huge mentor and influence on me\", said Rubilen Amit, a 2x World Champion and twice winner of the World Mixed Doubles with Reyes. Amit also led Team Asia as captain earlier this year in the AM8.com Queens Cup, which she credited Reyes to be a great influence on leadership skills.\"Kung lalaban ako sa pilipinas higit na mas mataas ang inaasahan sa sa amin / sa akin ng aking mga taga-hanga. Maraming pwedeng mangyari sa aking laro. Yung ibang mga lahi na aking makakalaban sigurado akong guston gusto nila akong talunin sa sarili kong bansa. Alam kong isa akong target sa kanilang lahat\", explained Reyes on what it's like to be playing in front of his home crowd. \"It's always more pressure at home. The fans expect so much of me. Anything can happen because all the other players want to beat me in front of the world. I have a target on my back and I know it.\"",

Dragon Promotions is pleased to announce the Kings Cup, a first time ever event pitting the men's champions of Europe & USA versus the champions of Asia in a three day contest to declare which side is the strongest, the East or the West. On November 19th-21st the world, as well as the players themselves, will find out! Four players on each side will be selected to represent their continent. The Kings Cup will be hosted by the award winning Resorts World Manila Casino & Hotel and produced by Dragon Promotions.\"We are thrilled to have these world champions from around the globe for the inaugural Kings Cup,\" said Stephen Reilly, Chief Operating Officer, Resorts World Manila. \"This will be a historic event -- with Asia going against Europe and USA for the very first time -- that will truly put the country on the sporting map for the duration of the tournament and beyond. RWM, as a strong advocate of the Filipino talent, is proud to support this major tournament that will showcase and reinforce the Philippines' contribution to the game of billiards.\" Resorts World is one of the largest and most successful casino chains in the world.The Queens Cup was broadcasted worldwide and exceeded ratings expectations. Many predict that the Kings Cup is going to be a gigantic hit as it touches upon the rivalry between the East and the West.Hot off the heels of the Queens Cup earlier this year, Dragon Promotions and Resorts World Manila is continuing the hot streak of international billiards in AsiaThe format of the Kings Cup will follow in the footsteps of the successful Queens Cup. Teams will play in versatile styles including singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples each of the 3 days of the men's competition.\"Why fix something if it's not broken? That was our philosophy when developing the Kings Cup. The format of the KingsCup was the evolution of numerous team events we have produced in the past from the United States, South Korea, China, and the Philippines. The media and fans loved the Queens Cup format, and more importantly the players loved it. And that's important for the event to be dynamic. I truly feel this is the best format there is for a team event in this sport\", said Charlie Williams, Executive Producer of the Kings Cup. Williams was a 16 year veteran on the pro tour who created the formats for such hits as the World 14.1 Championship and the Queens Cup.The big question will be who will be selected for the honor this year to represent both sides.\"The Kings Cup is an event that has been 3 years in the making. We are really excited to announce the player selection. And we promise that no pool fan is going to be disappointed\", explained Cindy Lee, CEO of Dragon Promotions.An interesting dynamic will be the teaming of European and Americans together for the first time ever as one unit.\"That part I'm really excited about seeing. I know the top Americans have been getting beat on pretty good in international competition when it comes to teams, so I think this is going to be completely different. Which is a good thing I'm predicting\", said Williams.And about Team Asia?Lee adds, \"Oh, it's going to be a powerhouse team. Something I think that none of the players on the Western Team can say they've ever faced before. It's going to be a scary challenge for both sides\"",

Siguro naunahan lang namin or matter of breaks lang siguro, said F2 Logistics coach Ramil De Jesus.Hindi biro pag nasa harap mo na yung mga imports then three imports sila actually four pa nga andyan pa yung (Mar-Jana) Phillips. So hindi madaling kalaban, hindi mo pwedeng biru biruin so talagang disiplina dapat pagdating sa loob ng court.The Cargo Movers controlled the opening set but needed to mount a rally from 20-22 down in the closing stretch of the second frame. F2 Logistics again fell behind 18-22 in the third set before sparking a closing 7-1 rally.Perez tied the frame at 22 after a kill block on Rialen Sante followed by an attack error by Lady Realtors Ukranian import Bohdana Anisova that gave the Cargo Movers a one-point lead.Desiree Cheng sent his service short in the next play but Canadian Marisa Field smashed his serve straight to the net as F2 Logistics took match point, 24-23. Kim Dy blocked Anisova to seal the win in the 88-minute duel.Anisova scored 14 points while Pam Lastimosa and Field combined for 15 markers for the Lady Realtors.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

Siguro kinargahan ng UST yung service nya, kami naman ang nagwawala sa first ball, added Reyes, who is also the head coach of UST in the UAAP. Nagwawala kami sa first ball, nagwawala rin kami sa service area. Nagiging problema namin ngayon yung passing ng team namin.

Malaking tulong sa akin kapag nand'yan si Grethcel,\" said Iriga City coach Parley Tupaz.\"Wala tayong magagawa, move on tayo kung talagang ganoon,\" he added. \"Huwag nating ipilit kasi siyempre may sariling rules ang PSL.\"---Follow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles",

Only collegiate players are allowed to play in other leagues provided that they carry the colors of their respective universities.As we discussed with you in our previous meetings, the Philippine Superliga strictly enforces the One-League Policy prohibiting its players from playing and / or participating in other volleyball tournaments during their one-year playing commitment with the PSL. A violation of this policy both merits a suspension and fine, said Suzara in a letter in which Soltones and the team owners were also copy furnished.Suzara added that hes just protecting the interest of the league and that other team owners also questioned her participation in the said exhibition match.The act of Ms. Soltones playing/participating in the PVL All-Stars is a clear violation of the existing policy. For this reason, the PSL Board hereby imposes upon Ms. Soltones a FINE of P50,000 and SUSPENSION for one year effective 06 November 2017 to 05 November 2018.Kindly be advised that the P50,000 shall be for the account of Ms. Soltones. The suspension shall only be lifted after one year and payment of the imposed fine.Alfelor made an appeal and the league set an emergency team owners meeting on Tuesday to tackle the issue.Fotons Jaja Santiago was also invited to play in the PVL All-Star Sunday but informed organizers of her withdrawal citing the one-league policy of the PSL.Last year, Standard Insurance-Navy players Lilet Mabbayad and Pau Soriano were assessed with a similar infraction after playing for Bureau of Customs in the V-League.Iriga City will take on unbeaten Foton in the 2017 PSL Grand Prix at the Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan on Tuesday without Soltones.Serbian import Tamara Kmezic and Japanese reinforcements Saama Miyagawa and Minami Yoshioka will be carrying most of the load as the Lady Oragons look to score another victory after a five-set upset win over Sta.

LuciaBACOLOD CITY -- Cignal veteran Rachel Anne Daquis wont be seeing action for at least two weeks.The former Philippine Superliga Most Valuable Player skipped the HD Spikers out-of-town game in Bacolod City Saturday to rest because of a left leg muscle spasm.Head coach George Pascua told reporters that Daquis, who was behind Cignals bench in the 2017 PSL Grand Prixs Spike on Tour in a sorry five-set loss to Cocolife held at the packed University of St. La Salle gym here, was nursing an injury she sustained a week ago against Petron.May muscle spasm (left) siya dahil dun sa paghabol niya ng bola last game (against Petron), said Pascua, whose squad absorbed its second straight defeat in a 25-19, 26-24, 25-27, 16-25, 9-15, decision against the Asset Managers.Last week against her former team Blaze Spikers, Daquis went after the ball in the third set and successfully saved it but not after hitting the baseline ad board almost almost diving on the statisticians table.The HD Spikers eventually won the said rally after Daquis heroics but unfortunately lost the battle, 25-19, 9-25, 22-25, 26-28.The former Far Eastern University standout even posted a funny photo of her while saving the ball with a 'hugot line' caption on her Twitter account.Umasa ako sasaluhin mo ko pero bibitawan mo din pala ako.

(AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)GRAHAM DUNBAR, AP Sports WriterPARIS (AP)  Cristiano Ronaldo dragged Portugal back from the brink of elimination twice, and Ireland found a late goal to stun Italy and stay in the European Championship on Wednesday.Iceland's winning goal in stoppage-time against Austria wrote another chapter of the tournament's feel-good story and set up a round of 16 clash with England.Belgium, widely seen as a potential champion, confirmed its place in the supposedly easier half of the knockout bracket by beating Sweden 1-0. The victory also signaled the start of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's retirement from the Swedes' national team.Sweden and Austria are heading home now, as are Turkey and Albania, which had hung around in France hoping that results would fall their way and lead to a place in the last 16 among the best third-placed teams.Those hopes were dashed on Wednesday.Portugal and Ireland earned the final two slots on a day of wildly swinging fortunes and emotions.Ronaldo showed an array of anguished expressions and gestures as Portugal, needing at least a draw to advance, trailed three times to a Hungary side that already was sure to advance - yet sought to top Group F.First, Ronaldo created one equalizer for teammate Nani, and then he scored two himself in the second half  the first with an audacious flick of his right heel  as a thriller ended 3-3 in Lyon.\"This was an insane match. Three times we were going home,\" said Ronaldo, who set an all-time European Championship record of scoring in four different editions.With one more goal when Portugal plays Croatia on Saturday in Lens, Ronaldo will tie Michel Platini's career scoring record of nine goals at European finals tournaments.Ronaldo seemed destined for yet another knockout encounter with old rival England until Iceland's Arnor Ingvi Traustason scored in the last of four added minutes. Now Nice will welcome Iceland to play the English on Monday.If Iceland and its happy fans have become many neutrals' favorite team at Euro 2016, they have taken a role Ireland has had at previous major tournaments.Ireland delighted its passionate throng of green-clad fans in Lille when Robbie Brady headed an 85th-minute goal to win 1-0 against Italy, which already was sure to top Group E.Until that moment, Ireland was going home and Turkey was set to get one of the third-place slots.Ireland's reward is some unfinished business with France in Lyon on Sunday. When last they met, in a playoff to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, a notorious handball by France striker Thierry Henry led to the decisive goal in extra time at Stade de France.Other round of 16 fixtures slotted into place only when the group-stage was completed Wednesday.Northern Ireland now knows it will play group winner Wales in a British derby match in Paris on Saturday.Two-time defending champion Spain, World Cup holder Germany, host France, Italy and England are all in the same half of the draw.___Round of 16 draw (Philippine time):Switzerland vs. Poland (Saint-Etienne, 9 p.m., June 25, Saturday), Wales vs. Northern Ireland (Paris, 12 midnight, June 26, Sunday), Croatia vs. Portugal (Lens, 3 a.m., June 26, Sunday)France vs. Ireland (Lyon, 9 p.m., June 26, Sunday), Germany vs. Slovakia (Lille, 12 midnight, June 27, Monday), Hungary vs. Belgium (Toulouse, 3 a.m., June 27, Monday)Italy vs. Spain (Saint-Denis, 12 midnight, June 28, Tuesday), England vs. Iceland (Nice, 3 a.m., June 28, Tuesday)ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD channel 166 will broadcast all the UEFA Euro 2016 round of 16 matches live (ABS-CBN Sports+Action channel 23 will air the 12 midnight at 3 a.m. games live)",

Real Madrid won 5-3 on penalties after the match ended 1-1 after extra time. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterLONDON (AP)  Lucas Vazquez has never played for Spain. Marcus Rashford is fresh from his England debut. Joshua Kimmich has only one Germany cap.They are all going to the European Championship next week.Tuesday was deadline day for the 23-man squads to be submitted to UEFA and a clutch of inexperienced but precocious players made the cut for some of the continent's biggest teams.One of the biggest surprises was Vazquez making the Spain squad, fresh from scoring a penalty in Real Madrid's Champions League triumph on Saturday, at the expense of more established club teammate Francisco \"Isco\" Alarcon.Both are 24, but Vazquez only made his breakthrough last season and his international debut could come in France where Spain is chasing its third successive European title.\"It is a dream come true,\" Vazquez wrote on Twitter.Veteran strikers Diego Costa and Fernando Torres had already been dropped by Vicente del Bosque. But Hector Bellerin, the 21-year-old Arsenal defender, is another Spaniard handed an unexpected late inclusion in a tournament squad for the first time after only making his international debut on Sunday.\"Persistence and hard work always pays off,\" Bellerin tweeted.England has gambled with an even more precocious talent.Three months ago, the 18-year-old Rashford hadn't even played a senior game in professional soccer. But after his premature graduation from the Manchester United academy to plug an injury gap in the first-team squad, Rashford flourished.Eight goals and 17 appearances later, collecting an FA Cup winners' medal on the way, Rashford's case for inclusion in the Euro 2016 squad looked a lot less implausible.Rashford proved too good for Roy Hodgson to leave behind once he made his England debut on Friday  scoring inside three minutes against Australia.Now he is among five attacking options including United teammate Wayne Rooney, the 30-year-old England captain.Germany is also taking emerging talent in a bid to become world and European champions simultaneously.Two midfielders  Kimmich of Bayern Munich and Julian Weigl of Dortmund  and Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno only made their debuts on Sunday in a loss to Slovakia. Yet, they made the final squad, along with Schalke midfielder Leroy Sane, who has only three Germany caps.Not featuring in qualifying has also proved no barrier to defender Nico Elvedi and midfielder Denis Zakaria, both 19 and heading to France with the Switzerland squad.There was another setback for the host nation ahead of the cutoff for squads to be submitted. Lassana Diarra is out of contention for France because of swelling in his left knee and the midfielder was replaced by Morgan Schneiderlin.The flashiest squad announcement on Tuesday was in Rome as Italy selected eight players with no tournament experience.All 23 squad members arrived in blue Fiat Pandas and they were presented on stage. Southampton forward Graziano Pelle, a former champion dancer, was also forced into showing off his moves, partnered by a scantily-dressed female dancer.___Rob Harris can be followed at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports",

    "text": "Sports and Action HD 5 Matches Not to Miss at the European ChampionshipFILE - In this Sunday, July 1, 2012 file photo, the Spanish team poses with the trophy after the Euro 2012 soccer championship final between Spain and Italy in Kiev, Ukraine. The European Championship has a reputation for being the soccer fans favorite tournament on the global calendar. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File)GRAHAM DUNBAR, AP Sports WriterGENEVA (AP)  Every fourth summer, football lovers tune in to what many see as the tournament for the purists on the global calendar.The European Championship is often more fun than the World Cup, where the first-round group stage has more mismatches and can be too cautiously played.The UEFA-organized tournament enjoys a reputation for hitting higher standards from first kick-off with no weak spots in the lineup.Now UEFA has added to the perfect 16-team format, and a 24-nation Euro 2016 will stretch to 51 matches over 31 midsummer days in France.Could 20 more matches mean less must-see action as top teams are kept apart for longer? Maybe.Still, there is appointment viewing from the first whistle on June 10, even without including World Cup winner Germany facing Poland and Robert Lewandowski.Here are five matches and story lines that stand out:___FRANCE vs. ROMANIA (June 10, Paris)The host nation kicks off a major four-yearly tournament. What more do you need?This opening match is heavy with emotion at a national stadium which was a target for suicide bombers who failed to get access to France's friendly against Germany last Nov. 13.All of Paris will be on high security alert, and France will be determined to show it is a nation and national team united.France stars like Paul Pogba, a flamboyant midfielder, and speedy forward Antoine Griezmann can help ensure the post-match focus is about events on the field.___ALBANIA vs. SWITZERLAND (June 11, Lens)There has quite simply never been an international match like this.Brothers in opposition, players with close club ties, and possible futures together with a different national team immediately after the tournament.Both squads have several players who were eligible to represent either country, because their ethnic Albanian families have moved from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland since the 1980s.Each has a Xhaka brother  Taulant for Albania and his younger brother Granit, a Switzerland star  who would be the first brothers in opposition at a Euro tournament.Opponents on June 11 could be Kosovo teammates in September. The Balkan republic got FIFA membership weeks ago and will join a World Cup qualifying group. The issue of transferring allegiance is on hold until after the competition.___ENGLAND vs. RUSSIA (June 11, Marseille)A prime-time fixture on the first Saturday could launch a young England team as Europe's most watchable.If few would bet on England to win Euro 2016, more would wager on it playing in the most exciting match.Coach Roy Hodgson has a core of talent from a thrilling Tottenham team, plus late-blooming Jamie Vardy whose goals lifted Leicester to a Premier League title that renewed neutrals' enthusiasm for football.Russia helped light up Euro 2008, and needs to put a dull Fabio Capello-coached era behind it.Get used to seeing Russia at this time of year: It hosts the Confederations Cup next June and then the 2018 World Cup.___SPAIN vs. CZECH REPUBLIC (June 13, Toulouse)Does two-time defending champion Spain still have it?Yes, at club level, having swept up every European trophy since before the 2014 World Cup.But Spain's aura of invincibility vanished two years ago, when an aging team was the first eliminated after being outplayed by the Netherlands and Chile.Coach Vicente del Bosque remains but the loyalty  arguably, too much  he showed some players in Brazil is over, judging by this squad selection. Tournament newcomers include 35-year-old Athletic Bilbao forward Aritz Aduriz.The Czechs missed the World Cup but offer a tough start. They topped a tricky qualifying group, despite conceding goals in every game, and with better results away than at home.___BELGIUM vs. ITALY (June 13, Lyon)Europe's top team in the FIFA world rankings against tournament veterans any title hopeful should measure up to fans' high standards.No. 2-ranked Belgium has been a fashionable choice since before the 2014 World Cup with a golden generation of players to call on.Still, its underwhelming World Cup ended with a tame quarterfinal loss to Argentina.Star players also have much to prove. Eden Hazard will certainly be fresh after a low-key season at Chelsea, where Italy coach Antonio Conte is headed next.Italy was beaten 3-1 by Belgium in Brussels last November, and is without injured playmaker Claudio Marchisio, but the Azzurri are always an essential chapter of every tournament's story.",

Javee Mocon is nothing but glad that San Beda proved that the road to a title still goes through them.Lyceum of the Philippines set the NCAA 93 Mens Basketball Tournament on fire in the elimination round.Coming into Game 1 of the best-of-three Finals, however, they didnt have something San Beda College had in abundance  championship experience.And so, the Red Lions finally solved the puzzle that once was the Pirates to seize a 1-0 lead in the series last Friday.Along with moving one win away from their league-leading 21st title, the Mendiola-based squad wanted nothing more than to flex the muscles of their championship experience. This is the Finals, this is a test of character. Wed like to show everybody na sinasabing Lyceum has all the heart, veteran forward Javee Mocon said.He then continued, Wed like to show na mas malaki ang heart namin cause were the champions.Indeed, that heart has been proven time and again in the last decade or so as they have won nine of the last 11 championships.Now in a series where they are the unlikely underdogs, San Beda actually has extra fuel to the fire. We want to show everybody na were the best team. Lahat, pinag-uusapan sila e, Mocon furthered.He then continued, Kami, low-key lang, pero we will show everybody na di kami mag-back down.Indeed, being all too familiar in playing on the biggest stage and under the brightest lights is the Red Lions biggest advantage over their upstart challengers. The last 12 years na Finals kami, siyempre big pressure and nako-control na namin lahat. Na-experience na namin to lahat so we know how to handle everything already, he said.And in heading into Game 2, Mocon had one more challenge for himself and his teammates. As he put it, Sila lang nakatalo sa amin, twice pa. Na-sweep nila ang eliminations so we have to sweep them sa Finals.Game 2 of the Finals between San Beda and LPU is on Thursday at the Araneta Coliseum.

    "text": "NCAA Bolick says Perez-led LPU is best team hes ever facedCHALLENGE ACCEPTED. All year long, San Beda's Robert Bolick has wanted nothing more than to take down CJ Perez and LPU.In the first round of the NCAA 93 Mens Basketball Tournament, Lyceum of the Philippines University sent a statement to defending champion San Beda College via a convincing 96-91 victory.Then in the second round meeting between the two teams, the Pirates did it again with a 107-105 double-overtime win.For Robert Bolick, those are more than enough reason to say that LPU is the greatest challenge he, as a player, has ever faced. Ang galing talaga ng Lyceum. Feeling ko, sa buong career ko sa basketball, sila yung pinakamagaling na team na nakalaban ko, he said.Take note that this is the same player who was San Bedas defensive stopper for Arellano Universitys Jiovani Jalalon in last seasons NCAA Finals as well as Cignals main man up against Mark Cruz and Jerwin Gaco-led Tanduay in the PBA D-League earlier in the year.This is also the same player who was once part of a De La Salle University side which went up against Ray Parks Jr.s National University, Kiefer Ravenas Ateneo de Manila University, and Jeric Tengs University of Sto. Tomas. Also, he played for College of St. Benilde-La Salle Greenhills when they went up against dynastic San Beda High in the Juniors.Meaning, his statement is only the biggest of compliments for a Pirate crew which had just made its first-ever championship round.Pressed further, Bolick said that LPUs pressure defense sets it apart. Ang hirap ng LPU talaga kasi talagang ang galing nilang dumepensa. Sabi nga ni coach, tumalikod ka, nandun na sila agad, he said.He then continued, Theyre a really good team. Talagang mauubos mo lahat. They bring out the best in us.That is even truer for the 20-year-old who was matched up with Season MVP CJ Perez. Ang galing niya, magaling talaga siya. You cant stop him and you just force him to tough shots, the former said.He then continued, MVP siya e. Hes MVP for a reason.And when Bolick and the Red Lions finally got one over Perez and the Pirates in Game 1 of the best-of-three Finals, the former was only looking forward to another round. Sabi ko sa kanya, congratulations on the MVP, you deserve it. See you in Game 1, he shared.Game 2 of the Finals between San Beda and LPU is on Thursday at the Araneta Coliseum.

    "text": "NCAA BEST OF 5 Part 5: No one-and-done for forward-looking LPUPRESS START. CJ Perez will be back for one more year in the NCAA - and LPU hopes that this is only the origin of their continued contention.Read Part 1 of ABS-CBN Sports Best of 5 series on the LPU Pirates here.Read Part 2 of ABS-CBN Sports Best of 5 series on the LPU Pirates here.Read Part 3 of ABS-CBN Sports Best of 5 series on the LPU Pirates here.Read Part 4 of ABS-CBN Sports Best of 5 series on the LPU Pirates here.---Lyceum of the Philippines University is so close to the greatest season in the 93-year history of the NCAA that they can taste it.After going undefeated through 18 games in the elimination round, the Pirates need just two more wins to complete the greatest-ever perfect season.Yes, a 20-0 record will put them in a league of their own.The last team to have accomplished a perfect season was San Beda College in 2010, but only had an 18-0 record as there were just nine teams in the league then.While that would be the fitting end to what has been a magical season, the Intramuros-based squad doesnt want an ending just yet.ITS THE CLIMBFor them, a championship  or a runner-up finish  is just another step they are taking in their journey. As head coach Topex Robinson put it, Building a culture is not a one-time thing; its gonna take a while. I always remind myself na not just because were in the Finals, we forget ano ba yung vision namin.He then continued, There has to be a constant reminder to myself that setting a culture is a combination of all the seasons thats about to come.Robinson has not gotten tired of reminding his boys that all of this, from the underwhelming first two seasons to this magical season, is just a part of their overarching desire to inspire others.And so, for LPU, the championship round up against the defending champion Red Lions is only yet another chance to showcase skills and have a positive effect on all who are watching them. I always tell them that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Sabi ko nga, the longer we play this season, the longer we could really spread the word, the always amiable mentor said.He then continued, At the same time, I always tell them that now theyre in this position, mas malaki yung responsibility. People know who they are so mas marami dapat silang matutulungan.\"MAKE A MARKWithout a doubt, its nothing but amazing to watch, or read about, or hear about the Pirates who just joined the first and oldest collegiate league in the country in 2011 and are now knocking on the door of history.All of that, they have done by standing as David to the Goliaths of the land such as San Beda. The masses could relate to us because were not a well-funded program. We dont have the money like the other big programs have, Robinson shared.He then continued, What we have are people who are committed to winning. What we have are players na napulot ko sa tabi-tabi and are just happy to be given a second life.CHIP ON THE SHOULDERCJ Perez, the MVP frontrunner, went from Pangasinan to San Sebastian College-Recoletos and then transferred to Ateneo de Manila University only to find his home inside the walls of Intramuros.MJ Ayaay, the glue guy, went from the end of the bench to a key reserve and now, team captain. Mike Nzeusseu, the inside presence, is a forgotten name among all foreign student-athletes.Marcelino twins Jaycee and Jayvee found no place in Adamson University. Reymar Caduyac just may be the steadiest player in the league, but gets no props for it.Robinson himself failed to find success in his first coaching gig with alma mater San Sebastian.The list goes on and on and on for all of LPU.Always remembering how they had to claw for every inch just to get to where they are keeps each and every one of them going. We always go back to saan ba tayo dati? Sila, tinapon sila ng teams nila and now, they have an opportunity to redeem themselves, their mentor said.He then continued, Once you touch that part of their lives, they really become more aligned to where I wanna go. Thats where I keep them grounded.THE BLUEPRINTAll season long, the Pirates have said they want nothing more than to inspire others.Now their story is coming to its climax, they hope they have already done just that. I hope that we could also inspire programs that are not well-funded to really look deep inside their hearts to find a way. Instead of complaining, you can find a way to win, Robinson said.And so, win or lose in their first-ever Finals, the crew from Intramuros is already on the right track. Whatever happens in the Finals, our vision is not gonna stop there. Were not a goal-oriented team; were vision-oriented. Goal is you hit a number, its done while vision is, its way beyond whats happening now, the head coach said.He then continued, We can be contented now  nobody thought we were gonna be 18-0. But again, thats not what we want. What we want is to be persons who make an impact, who become an inspiration.THINK BIGGERAnd watch out, LPU is not just limiting itself to the NCAA, to the sport of basketball, and even to the Philippines. You know, being part of something bigger than yourself is really important. Were here to change the world, how good is that, Robinson mused.He then continued, Were talking about the world  not just the LPU community, not just the NCAA, but whoever we could touch. Thats not a guarantee of winning a championship, but its always about giving, sharing, and inspiring.Indeed, you and LPU made us believe, coach.Now, believe us when we say.Win or lose, these LPU Pirates made an impact.Win or lose, these LPU Pirates are here to stay.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Topex Robinson has led LPU to an undefeated record with a tantalizing talent Tab Baldwin would have love to have coached.Time and again, the Lyceum of the Philippines University Pirates have said that they are a no superstar team.Indeed, an entire team that has bought into the run and gun game has propelled LPU to the top.However, one person has been the engine for the Pirates.CJ Perez is the frontrunner for MVP with per game counts of 19.3 points in 45.1 percent shooting, 6.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.9 steals all while leading the Intramuros-based squad to a sweep of the elimination round and an automatic advance into the championship round.One coach away from the NCAA and on the other side of Manila had been nothing but impressed with LPUs main man. Hes (head coach Topex Robinson) is lucky that hes got him instead of us, Ateneo de Manila University coach Tab Baldwin said.Perez played for San Sebastian College-Recoletos for two seasons before transferring and spending 2015 to 2016 in Ateneo.With his time in Katipunan not working out, however, the do-it-all swingman reunited with mentor Robinson now for the Pirates.If things would have played out differently, Perez would have been also at the forefront for the Blue Eagles who are wreaking havoc themselves in the UAAP.No doubt, Baldwin would have loved to have seen that. As he put it, hes one of the guys that I would really love to have made it to Ateneo. We lost him and I thought that was a big loss for us and now, hes proving how big a loss that was. hes just a tremendous talent.Nonetheless, the American-Kiwi mentor is nothing but glad to see a former Atenean thrive. Hes playing with the kind of discipline that coach Topex wants him to. He really makes that team play to another level, he said.Along with Perez, Baldwin was also all praises for the rest of the LPU crew. All those players are 100 percent committed to the coach and the philosophy and thats why theyre winning, he said.Heres to hoping that Baldwin, Thirdy Ravena, and Ateneo will get to face off with Robinson, Perez, and LPU sooner than later.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Michael Calisaan and San Sebastian are confident that they will only continue showcasing their skills on the playoff stage of the NCAA.San Sebastian College-Recoletos stampede in the NCAA 93 Mens Basketball Tournament has been put to a stop.San Beda College knocked off the Golden Stags last Tuesday to claim the only remaining Finals berth.Still, it was, without a doubt, a successful campaign for the boys from Recto who celebrated a return to the playoffs after a four-year absence.And not just for the players themselves, but also for the Baste community which had long been used to winning. Were very happy that the San Sebastian community again is united and very supportive. One of our goals is to bring back the glory days of Baste, head coach Egay Macaraya said.He then continued, Were one step closer to achieving that goal and hopefully, next year we can do better.Now they have made the playoffs and will be bringing back the band for next season, the future is only looking even brighter for San Sebastian.

Joel Cagulangan is the foremost reason why CSB-LSGH is still alive and kicking in the NCAA 93 Juniors Basketball Tournament.Joel Cagulangan has won three games for College of St. Benilde-La Salle Greenhills by his lonesome in the NCAA 93 Juniors Basketball Tournament.And with a 27-point, six-rebound, and five-assist outing on Friday, he again gave the Junior Blazers their biggest win of the season thus far.After discarding San Beda High Schools twice-to-beat advantage in their semifinals series, the point guard is not mincing his words about his and his teams goal. Siyempre, yung championship kasi history yun sa La Salle e. Yung individual (awards), bonus na lang po yun, he said.CSB-LSGH has yet to win a championship in the NCAA and Cagulangan is doing his best to change that.That is even more true as he has already tasted the sweet taste of victory as a national champion, no less, in the 2013 Palarong Pambansa.As the shining star of the Northern Mindanao regions basketball team, the Butuan native showed the way for his team as they toppled the likes of usual favorites National Capital Region and Region IV-A.And there, he opened the eyes of scouts of the Junior Blazers.Seeing an opening to showcase his skills on a bigger stage and under brighter lights, he put his head down and pushed forward  much like what he does on the court. Bata pa po ako nun so ayaw ko sana, pero sabi po ng magulang ko, opportunity to. Kung gusto ko talaga mag-basketball, iba yung nasa Manila, he recalled.Once he transferred to Manila, Cagulangan spent his first two years polishing his craft.When his rookie season finally rolled along, he wasted no time in flashing the form that has made him the all-around dynamo he is today.And now in his second year, he has only been more impressive  more impressive than when he was a Palaro champion, more impressive than when he was a rookie who took control as CSB-LSGHs lead guard.Even with per game counts of 14.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 2.4 steals in 30.1 minutes, the now 17-year-old is still improving. Hes just getting better and better. We havent seen the best of him yet, a proud head coach Marvin Bienvenida said of his prized ward.As they head into a do-or-die matchup with the Red Cubs two weeks from now, Cagulangan is confident about their chances. May pressure po, siyempre, sa akin, pero sabi ng coaches, laruin ko lang and i-lead ko lang yung team. Marami rin naman kaming ibang player tulad ni [Inand] Fornilos, he said.He then continued, Tulong-tulong lang kami rito.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

Nagtatanong-tanong ako kanina tapos may random guy na lumipat sa akin tas binalita na champion na nga daw.Parang nawala 'yung kaba ko, naging mas light 'yung feeling ko noong game, added Marano, who herself had a great game against Generika-Ayala.Inspired by Bolicks heroics, Tyang Aby finished with six markers to help the unbeaten Cargo Movers sweep the Lifesavers, 25-21, 25-17, 25-17.Though she was not there to cheer for Bolick, Marano, who was able to watch the series opener last Friday, never doubted her long-time boyfriends capabilities and knew that hell be able to deliver for the SBC.Last year, ganoon din 'yung nangyari sa amin - may game din ako tapos di ko napanood 'yung Finals niya, she said. Naging positive lang kami. Whether I'm there or not, tiwala na lang na maglalaro siya nang mabuti.After the game, Bolick thanked Marano for pushing and inspiring him to achieve his goal of giving the Red Lions another crown.Marano was just proud to see Bolick, who transferred from De La Salle University to SBC three years ago, reap the rewards of his hard work.Ang sarap-sarap sa pakiramdam kasi nga nasubaybayan ko 'yung struggles niya dati, said Marano. Every day na magkasama kami, kita mong nandoon 'yung depression. Ngayon, makikita mo na bumalik talaga lahat ng confidence niya and kung sino talaga siya as a basketball player, added Marano. Napakasarap sa feeling.And how would she describe her feeling as a girlfriend of an NCAA champion?Marano had a straightforward answer.Masasabi ko lang na sobrang proud ako na girlfriend ako ni Bolick kasi nakikita ko talaga 'yung sarili ko sa kanya, she said.

Robert Bolick has had the all-out support of his mom Zeny all throughout his career.Heading into Game 2 of the Finals, with San Beda College needing one more win for back-to-back championships, Robert Bolick did not get a good nights sleep.Hindi ako makatulog kagabi, he told reporters as the Red Lions still found themselves down 1-2 in the season series against Lyceum of the Philippines University.Good thing then that the 23-year-old had his lifelong comfort zone there with him. Dasal lang ako nang dasal. Katabi ko nanay ko, dasal lang kami nang dasal, he said.Apparently, the prayers worked as he scored seven points in the last five minutes to lead the defending champions in blanking the Pirates in the championship round.In the end, he had 18 points, six assists, and five rebounds and was one of the major reasons in the Mendiola-based squads 10th title in the last 12 years  and 21st overall. Kapag nanonood si mom, talagang ibibigay mo ang best mo, he said afterward.Not long after, Bolick was celebrating with the very same person who gave birth to him. I just want to thank my mom.

He said report on Monday,\" Potts said after he officially wrapped his San Beda career with yet another ring.After bursting to the scene last season as the Red Lions' \"Mr. Fourth Quarter\", Potts had a relatively pedestrian second season with San Beda.It showed because his draft stock dropped so hard the Aces landed him late in the second round, a steal according to a lot of people.Still, despite an okay regular season, Potts saved his best for last in the Finals, helping the Red Lions take down the 18-0 Pirates.He averaged a solid 15 points a game in the Finals, a reliable third option behind the clutch Robert Bolick and Finals MVP Donald Tankoua.\"I have mixed feelings. I mean, it was really hard for me this year,\" he said.\"It's a combination of character and attitude. I keep a lot of things at the back of my mind with my history with San Beda, I owe it to them for bringing me here. Just making sure that we live the legacy and continue the championship [tradition]. Make sure we have that winning culture here,\" Potts added.Winning a championship, Potts says that staying at San Beda was worth it. Even if he had some struggles along the way.\"This is a testament to show that no matter what you go through, no matter how much you have to go through, you can always bounce back,\" he said\"That is a testament to all the people that look up to me and make sure that nothing is easy, you have to earn it,\" Potts added.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @paullintag8",

Why? Because he's loves it there.\"That's why I stayed for a year, because of them. Pwede na ako magpa-draft, pero it's my responsibility to give one more year for San Beda.

Donald Tankoua made the most out of his first starring role in the Finals.Without a doubt, it was Robert Bolick who took charge when it mattered most for San Beda College in the two-game Finals of the NCAA 93 Mens Basketball Tournament.Also without a doubt, however, was that Donald Tankoua imposed his will all throughout both games.And so, with averages of 22 points, 18.5 rebounds, and one steal, the Cameroonian powerhouse was the runaway Most Valuable Player in the Finals.Of course, he was going to give his all after he missed out on the Finals a year ago.Last season, the Red Lions big man had for himself a dominant first round before tearing the ACL in his right knee. He was then forced to watch from the sidelines as his team made their way all the way to a championship.Now, Tankoua played a big part in back-to-back championships. I really wanted to win. I did all my best because I missed this last year, he told reporters post-game.As it turns out, however, the 23-year-old did all that while still making his way back to full health.

I still feel pain sometimes.He then continued, Actually, Im still doing therapy.Still, Tankoua said he was doing anything and everything to help San Beda.

Robert Bolick delivered when in mattered most for San Beda in the two games in the Finals.CHAAAAAMPIOOON!That was the yell coming from Robert Bolick after his post-game conference on Thursday at the Araneta Coliseum.That post-game conference was the punctuation mark in San Beda Colleges Finals blanking of erstwhile league-leading Lyceum of the Philippines University.Along with their 10th championship in the last 12 years, and 21st overall, the ultimate win was also a much-wanted and long-awaited one for the Red Lions.In the elimination round, the Mendiola-based squad were one of the victims of the Pirates rampage to an 18-0 sweep.LPU sent a statement to San Beda in the first round with a convincing 96-91 victory then did it again in the second round with a thrilling 107-105 double-overtime triumph.And so, the Pirates automatically advanced to the Finals while the Red Lions, for the first time in 12 years, had to run through the gauntlet just to get there.Bolick and company did nothing but take care of business and took down San Sebastian College-Recoletos to make the championship round.There, the 21-year-old finally took out his frustrations on a Intramuros-based crew that was well-rested.In Game 1, Bolick dropped seven of his 24 points in the last two minutes as San Beda came away with a 94-87 win.Two of those came after their opponents got to as close as 82-89.After that deuce, head coach Boyet Fernandez pulled back his main man from celebrating too early.And in Game 2, the Ormoc, Leyte native did it again in Game 2, scoring seven of his 22 markers in the last five minutes as they closed out the Finals with a 92-82 decision.Three of those came after their opponents got to as close as 82-83.Again, after that triple, Fernandez pulled back his main man from celebrating too early.Robert Bolick breaks out LeBron celebration after the dagger against LPU. #NCAASeason93 #NCAAStrong pic.twitter.com/33kzBDvuUC  ABS-CBN Sports (@abscbnsports) Nobyembre 16, 2017Asked about that celebration, a mix of LeBron James signature routine and DAngelo Russells ice in my veins, Bolick answered, through chuckles, Di ko na nga alam ano nangyayari.Now San Beda has wrapped up back-to-back championship wins, with a lot of help from his nine-point average in the final frames of the two games, he can now celebrate all he wants.From cutting the nets to yelling in the post-game conference, without a doubt, Bolick deserved it.---Follow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.",

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)PARIS (AP)  Former French minister for health and sport Roselyne Bachelot was ordered to pay 10,000 euros ($11,800) in damages to Rafael Nadal on Thursday after accusing him of doping.In March last year, Bachelot said on a French television show that Nadal's seven-month injury layoff in 2012 was \"probably due to a positive doping test.\"Nadal, who has won 16 Grand Slam titles, filed a defamation suit against Bachelot in Paris.The Spanish player said he will donate the money to a non-governmental organization or a foundation in France.\"When I filed the lawsuit against Mrs. Bachelot, I intended not only to defend my integrity and my image as an athlete but also the values I have defended all my career,\" Nadal said in a statement.Nadal said he wanted to keep public figures \"from making insulting or false allegations against an athlete ... without any evidence or foundation and to go unpunished.\"He said the lawsuit was never motivated by money.Bachelot was also ordered by the French tribunal to pay Nadal a suspended fine of 500 euros ($590).In April 2016, Nadal wrote to the president of the International Tennis Federation asking for all of his drug-test results and blood profile records to be made public. In the same letter, he said of Bachelot: \"It is unacceptable and mostly unfair that someone that should have knowledge of sports to a certain point and degree can publicly say something like this with no proof or evidence.\"",

Burglars hit the tennis star's Florida home, stealing $400,000 worth of goods while she was at the U.S. Open. Palm Beach Gardens police released a report Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017, about the burglary, which happened between Sept. 1 and 5. (AP Photo/Yong Teck Lim, File)By Terry Spencer, Associated PressFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  Burglars hit tennis star Venus Williams' Florida home, stealing $400,000 worth of goods while she was at the U.S. Open, police said Thursday.The burglary happened between Sept. 1 and 5 at Williams' 10,000-square-foot (1,000-square-meter) home, which is in a well-to-do gated community, Palm Beach Gardens police said in a statement. Police blacked out from their report what was stolen. No arrests have been made.Palm Beach County property records show Williams and her sister Serena bought the home new in 2000. It is now valued at $2.3 million.Venus Williams' agent, Carlos Fleming, did not respond to an email seeking comment. The burglary was first reported by WPEC-TV.This is the second time in five months Palm Beach Gardens police did not publicly release information about an incident involving Williams until it was reported by a news outlet.In June, Williams was involved in a traffic accident near her home that killed a passenger in the other car. Police have said the accident investigation remains open, and she is being sued by the dead man's estate. Palm Beach Gardens police did not issue a news release or the accident report until the website TMZ published a story three weeks after the crash.Maj. Eduardo Guillen said it is not the department's practice to issue news releases about major crimes and fatal traffic accidents involving its residents, something other departments in Florida and nationally do routinely.\"The department is not in the business of randomly releasing information on cases. Ms. Williams is a private citizen within our community and she will be extended the same privacy all our citizens expect,\" Guillen said in an email to The Associated Press.The suburb of about 54,000 residents is mostly middle class, but has wealthy enclaves.Williams, 37, has had one of her best recent years on the court, finishing second at both Wimbledon and the Australian Open and reaching the semi-finals at the U.S. Open.Williams has seven career Grand Slam titles and career on-court earnings of nearly $40 million. She has her own clothing line and endorsement deals with Ralph Lauren, Kraft foods, Tide detergent and Wilson sporting goods. She also owns a small percentage of the Miami Dolphins.",

    "text": "Tennis Sock advances with Federer to semifinals at ATP FinalsJack Sock of the United States plays a return to Alexander Zverev of Germany during their men's singles tennis match at the ATP World Finals at the O2 Arena in London, Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)By Chris Lehourites, Associated PressLONDON (AP)  In his ATP Finals debut, Jack Sock joined Roger Federer in the semifinals.Sock, the first American to reach the final weekend at the season-ending tournament since Andy Roddick in 2007, beat Alexander Zverev 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to advance from his round-robin group on Thursday.\"I didn't expect to be in London in the first place,\" said Sock, who qualified only this month after winning the Paris Masters. \"Paris was a big step for me. Now to put myself in the position to play on the weekend is another big step forward, another confidence-booster.\"Sock again played an entertaining match at the O2 Arena, complete with another 'tweener and even a point penalty for smashing a ball into the crowd.But it was a pair of errors from Zverev in the final game that gave Sock the match. Trailing 5-4 and at 30-all, Zverev double-faulted for the eighth time to hand Sock a match point. The 20-year-old German then put a forehand wide to end it.\"Yeah, I choked,\" Zverev said. \"It's quite easy. Won the second set 6-1. I was 1-0 with a break. He got a point penalty. I was down 1-4 within 10 minutes where I didn't put many balls in the court.\"Sock finished the group stage with a 2-1 record and will next face Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals on Saturday. His only loss came against Federer in his opening match.Federer ended up 3-0 and won the group. He will face Dominic Thiem or David Goffin on Saturday.In a rematch of the Wimbledon final against Marin Cilic earlier, Federer came out on top again. The second-ranked Swiss lost the first set but still won 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-1.\"It wasn't easy,\" Federer said. \"I mean, look, it's a fast court. It's indoors. We've seen it now: When you miss a few too many opportunities you can really pay the price at this tournament.\"The outcome didn't really matter, though. Federer had already advanced while Cilic had already been eliminated.Federer, who beat Cilic in straight sets in the Wimbledon final in July, had four break points in the first set on Thursday, but he couldn't convert any of them. Cilic closed it out in a tiebreaker.Federer had another break point early in the second set, but he again failed to convert. But his sixth attempt was different, and winning it gave Federer the second set.In the third set, Federer broke early and jumped out to 3-0, and then broke again to lead 5-1.\"In the beginning I was slightly overaggressive in the first set on some crucial points rather than maybe being patient,\" Federer said. \"I was able to turn that around late in the second set. Then just had a much better feeling in the third set.\"Cilic is ranked No. 5 in the world  achieving a goal he set for himself at the end of last season.At the ATP Finals, however, the Croat has won only once in nine matches over three appearances at the round-robin tournament.\"Overall, I felt that my level has come to a new level,\" the 2014 U.S. Open champion said of his 2017 season. \"So hopefully even more next year, I can aim a little bit higher. Hopefully I'm going to be in a position to challenge the top guys and to be in contention for Grand Slams.\"Federer, the 19-time Grand Slam champion who won his record eighth Wimbledon title, is looking to extend another record for titles at the ATP Finals. The 36-year-old Swiss has won it six times  twice in Houston, twice in Shanghai and twice in London.Federer has reached the semifinals at the ATP Finals 14 times and has finished the round-robin stage unbeaten 10 times.Regardless of the outcome in London, Federer will finish the year ranked No. 2  behind Rafael Nadal.\"I'm so happy that I was able to reach this level of play and still be able to play also at the end of the year,\" said Federer, who also won the Australian Open this season. \"I have no regrets because I totally over-exceeded my expectations. Just happy I'm injury-free and healthy right now, enjoying myself still.\"",

But it's fine. ... I mean, when you're so zoomed into the match, I don't even pay attention to all that.\"Dimitrov ended up winning 34 of the 47 points he served and won 32 of the 57 points served by Goffin.In the first set, Dimitrov lost only two points on his serve and twice broke Goffin without even going to deuce. Goffin finally managed to hold serve in the second set, but Dimitrov still was able to break the Belgian's serve two more times.\"I was just following my game. Just simple as that,\" Dimitrov said. \"I was using every opportunity. I took care of all of the balls that I had to.\"And he gave Goffin few chances to make a comeback.\"He came to the net from the beginning, from the first point,\" Goffin said. \"It was not easy for me to lose my serve from the start. It was tough for my confidence after that when it was 0-4.\"The win gives Dimitrov a 2-0 record and ensures he will play on the weekend in his debut at the season-ending tournament. Roger Federer has also already qualified for the semifinals.In Wednesday's late match, Dominic Thiem defeated Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.Thiem is now 1-1 and will next face Goffin, who is also 1-1, on Friday for a spot in the semifinals.Carreno Busta was playing in the place of Rafael Nadal, who withdrew after his opening loss because of a right knee injury. He will next play Dimitrov on Friday.Goffin beat Nadal in his opening match, calling it the best win of his career. But regardless of what happens against Thiem on Friday, Goffin still has more tennis this year with Belgium playing France in the Davis Cup final at the end of the month.\"This event is really important. It's one of the biggest events of the year. I'm going to focus on the next match. If there is another one, I will be focused on the next one. Then we will see,\" Goffin said. \"The Davis Cup, I'm not thinking about the Davis Cup for the moment. I know it's just after this event. We will see. I'm just focused on this event first, then we see after.\"",

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)By Sam Johnston, Associated PressLONDON (AP)  A day after the ATP Finals lost Rafael Nadal to injury, Roger Federer lifted spirits at the O2 Arena by extending his stay to the weekend.The 19-time Grand Slam champion guaranteed his place in Saturday's semifinals by defeating Alexander Zverev 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-1 on Tuesday.With Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray also absent due to injuries, the top-ranked Nadal's withdrawal on Monday left Federer as the only member of men's tennis' 'big-four' in the tournament.\"It was nice to be able to show maybe that quality of mine, that I can dig out these matches, these points time and time again, stay mentally tough,\" Federer said. \"In the third I started to play better. It was a tough match from the beginning till the end.\"Zverev, who won his opening match against Marin Cilic, will face Jack Sock on Thursday to decide who will join Federer in the final four. Sock defeated Cilic in the early match, with Federer's victory eliminating the Croat.\"It was a very positive match,\" Zverev said. \"Obviously he won it. He's in the semifinals. But even for me, I played the better match of the two today. I think I still have great chances of qualifying, playing Jack Sock next. I think if I continue having this level, I don't know, maybe you'll see me on the weekend still.\"After an opening set dominated by serve went to a tiebreak, Federer came from 4-0 down and saved a set point to take the lead.His grip on the match quickly tightened as a distracted Zverev made two double faults to gift a break in the opening game of the second set.However, the 20-year-old regained his poise and took advantage of a dip in Federer's first serve percentage to break back and then repeated the feat to force a deciding set.From there on it was all Federer. The six-time champion, who is 16-years older than his opponent, showed his big-match experience as he regrouped to break in the third game, before doing so twice more to seal the victory.Sock's 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory was the United States' first at the event in 10 years.The No. 8-seed, who seized qualification by winning the final Masters event of the season in Paris, lost his debut match to Federer, but he is now 1-1.While others might have been surprised at Sock becoming the first American to win at the elite season-ending event since Andy Roddick in 2007, the man himself wasn't.\"I wouldn't be out here playing, competing if I didn't think I could give myself a chance to win tournaments, to be here,\" Sock said.\"I'm not the type of guy that will just enter a draw and be happy to make the third round or the quarters or whatever. I'm here to win matches. I think if I do the right things and I play the right tennis, I can give myself a chance to play on the weekend of any tournament.\"Cilic has now won only one of his eight matches overall at the season-ending tournament.\"Definitely not a great record, but I felt that I played even well last year,\" Cilic said. \"In those three matches that I played, I had good chances at least to win. These two also. So just, you know, couple points away from closing those matches. A little bit unfortunate with that.\"",

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)By Sam Johnston, Associated PressLONDON (AP)  Rafael Nadal will have to wait another year to win the ATP Finals.The world No. 1 withdrew from the elite, season-ending tournament after losing his opening match to David Goffin 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-4 on Monday at the O2 Arena.Nadal pulled out of the Paris Masters at the quarterfinal stage 10 days ago and admitted ahead of the ATP Finals on the indoor hard-court he struggles on, that his knees, which have caused him trouble throughout his career, were still \"not perfect.\"Despite having qualified 13 consecutive times for the ATP Finals, only eight of which he's been fit enough to compete in, Nadal has never won the event. Spain will still be represented, as Nadal will be replaced by U.S. Open semifinalist Pablo Carreno Busta.\"My season is finished,\" Nadal said. \"Yeah, I had the commitment with the event, with the city, with myself. I tried hard. I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play. I tried, but seriously was miracle to be very close in the score during the match.\"After two breaks of serve each, Goffin claimed an ugly opening set via a tiebreak and was on the verge of victory in the second, but Nadal's fighting spirit saved four match points to force another tiebreaker and draw level.However, the third set proved a step too far for the 16-time Grand Slam champion, who began to struggle with his movement and was in visible pain. Goffin secured a double break to be 4-1, but Nadal rallied once more. He could retrieve only one of the breaks.\"It was tough even if he was not moving 100 percent,\" Goffin said. \"He was hitting the ball really hard. It's never easy to finish a match, to finish a set against him. Even if I lost four match points in the second, I had no regret. I kept going in the third.\"Nadal ominously waved goodbye as he left the court, bringing to an end another auspicious season. He won his 10th French Open in June, added a third U.S. Open in September and, at 31, became the oldest man to end the year atop of the rankings.With the Australian Open still over two months away, Nadal was confident playing in London wouldn't have done any lasting damage.\"The good thing is (this injury is) nothing new,\" Nadal said. \"Everybody of my team, we have the right experience on this thing. We hope to manage it well, to have the right rest, the right work, and try to be ready for the beginning of the next season.\"Nadal's exit simplifies Federer's path to a seventh ATP Finals title. The winner of 2017's other two Grand Slams returns to action against Alexander Zverev on Tuesday after defeating Jack Sock on Sunday.Making his debut at the ATP Finals earlier, Grigor Dimitrov withstood a comeback attempt from Dominic Thiem and held on for a 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 victory.The sixth-ranked Dimitrov maintained his focus despite being narrowly denied a chance to serve out the match in the second set, and then being broken at his first chance in the third.\"Every year you learn more about yourself, about the game, about the players,\" Dimitrov said. \"I've done also a lot of work on and off the court. It's finally starting to kind of, like, come together.\"",

United States defeated Belarus 3-2 and gained the Fed Cup title. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits)SANDRA HARWITT, Associated PressMINSK, Belarus (AP)  A 17-year championship drought came to an end Sunday for the United States when it beat Belarus 3-2 to take its 18th Fed Cup title.CoCo Vandeweghe and Shelby Rogers defeated Aryna Sabalenka and Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-3, 7-6 (3) in the deciding doubles of the 2017 final. It was the first Fed Cup title for the U.S. since 2000.\"It feels perfectly believable and unbelievable,\" Vandeweghe said. \"I'm ready for a vacation.\"The Belarus pair led 5-2 in the second set and served to level at one-set apiece in the eighth, 10th and 12th games. The Americans dominated the tiebreaker, winning five of the last six points.Sasnovich had kept Belarus alive after beating U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens 4-6, 6-1, 8-6 to leave the final level at 2-2 on the indoor hard-court Chizhovka Arena.Vandeweghe earlier beat Sabalenka 7-6 (5), 6-1 to give the U.S. a 2-1 lead.Kathy Rinaldi, in her inaugural season in charge of the Americans, became the first female captain in the tournament to lead a Fed Cup team to victory since Billie Jean King for the U.S. in 2000.\"It's been an incredible ride thanks to these ladies,\" Rinaldi said. \"We're family and we've had each other's backs. This was a very tough match.\"The U.S. holds the most Fed Cup titles in the international team competition. This was its fourth Fed Cup final since last winning in 2000. It lost the 2003, 2009 and 2010 finals.Belarus was making its first appearance in a Fed Cup final.\"We are really satisfied we gained this result,\" Belarus captain Eduard Dubrou said. \"Today's match has showed we have a good team because last time we faced the team of USA it was 5-love and today we were really close to a good result for us.\"Vandeweghe proved the difference between the two teams. She has won all eight Fed Cup matches she's played this season  six singles and two doubles. Vandeweghe is the first player to win eight matches since the current eight-team World Group format was introduced in 2005.\"I had a great time out there,\" Vandeweghe said. \"I really relished in that moment of having the crowd against me and firing myself up and believing in myself.\"The 25-year-old Vandeweghe is also the first player to win the maximum six Fed Cup singles in a year since Petra Kvitova for the Czech Republic in 2011.Stephens has lost six matches since winning the U.S. Open in September. She lost both singles matches here in Minsk, including to Sabalenka on Saturday.Stephens served for the match against Sasnovich at 5-3 in the third set, but was unable to clinch the title for the United States. It took Sasnovich two attempts, at 6-5 and 7-6 in the third set, to serve out the match.Sabalenka had an opportunity to take an early lead against Vandeweghe when leading 5-4 but failed to take advantage of a set point on Vandeweghe's serve in the 10th game.Sabalenka led 4-1 in the tiebreaker but surrendered her lead to a more measured Vandeweghe, who clinched the first set when the Belarussian blasted a forehand wide while going for a winner.Vandeweghe then jumped out to a 5-0 lead before Sabalenka won her only game of the second set.\"I know she was going to keep swinging,\" Vandeweghe said. \"I know what I had to do and knew what I expected she would do. I just kept the pressure on.\"",

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)CHRIS LEHOURITES, AP Sports WriterLONDON (AP)  One break of serve, and a mini-break, was all Roger Federer needed to win his opening match at the season-ending ATP Finals on Sunday.The 19-time Grand Slam champion broke Jack Sock at the start of his 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory at the O2 Arena. Both then held serve the rest of the way, with Federer losing only three points on his serve in the second set.\"Sure, I had a tactical plan with my team,\" Federer said. \"But very often in a first match like this, it gets thrown overboard because at the end you're just happy to be serving well. Focus on that first, and then on the return game sort of try your best, try to keep the ball in play, and go from there.\"The 36-year-old Federer, who is ranked No. 2 in the world and won the Australian Open and Wimbledon this season, is the oldest player ever to qualify for the season-ending tournament, which started in 1970.In the late match, Alexander Zverev beat Wimbledon runner-up Marin Cilic 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.Federer broke Sock, who was making his debut at the tournament, in the very first game, hitting a backhand winner to take the 1-0 lead.\"I missed one first serve in the first game,\" Sock said. \"I had my chances. He put me in some awkward positions on some of those forehands.\"That was the only break point for either player in the first set. But Federer had plenty more in the second set - five, to be exact. He just couldn't convert them.In the tiebreaker, Federer went ahead 3-2 with a mini-break, but Sock got it back. After another to make it 5-4, however, it was nearly over. Federer won the final two points on his serve to go to 1-0 in the round robin.Sock had his moments, though, including a tweener in the second set when he was leading 40-15. Federer got to it and hit a backhand winner.\"When he hit it, it wasn't very clean. I figured it was going to go out. It landed just inside both lines,\" said Sock, who still won the game. \"But, I don't know. It's Roger, I guess. He can do no wrong. Everything goes in.\"Another light-hearted moment came when Sock hit a shot that should have set up an easy winner for Federer. Instead of taking a defensive stance, Sock turned his back to Federer as if to protect himself from a shot to body.Federer, surprisingly, put his easy chance into the net.\"It was a big distraction, I'll tell you that,\" Federer joked about Sock's backside, \"because it was very big. That's what I should have aimed for.\"Federer has won a record six titles at the ATP Finals, including two in Houston, two in Shanghai and two in London. His last one came in 2011.In 2017, he has won a tour-best seven titles, the most he has won since taking eight in 2007.Sock is one of four players to qualify for the tournament for the first time. Zverev, Grigor Dimitrov and David Goffin also qualified, though Goffin played in the tournament last year as an alternate after Gael Monfils withdrew.After the Federer match, Rafael Nadal was given his trophy for finishing the year as the No. 1 player in the rankings.The Spaniard will play his first match at the tournament for the top eight players in the world on Monday against Goffin. In the early match, Dimitrov will face Dominic Thiem",

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits)By Sandra Harwitt, Associated PressMINSK, Belarus (AP)  U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens lost in three sets to Aryna Sabalenka as host Belarus and the United States ended the opening day of the Fed Cup final evenly poised at 1-1.Sabalenka beat Stephens 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 Saturday after CoCo Vandeweghe earlier defeated Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-4, 6-4 to give 17-time champion United States a 1-0 lead.The Americans are looking to break a 17-year championship drought, while Belarus is playing in its first Fed Cup final.Sabalenka's carefree and often careless tennis resulted in 31 winners and 57 unforced errors. She won on a fourth match point when Stephens netted a forehand.A wild third set saw six straight breaks of serve before Sabalenka held in the seventh game.\"(It's) a good experience for me because I've never felt these emotions, playing at home and the score is 0-1,\" Sabalenka said.Stephens has yet to win any of the five matches she's played since winning the U.S. Open.\"We're playing Fed Cup so anything goes,\" Stephens said. \"I want to play like that. That was insane. Playing for her country, the crowd behind her, she played great.\"Vandeweghe also faced a boisterous crowd at the indoor hard court in Minsk as she played Sasnovich for the first time.\"I think that's part of having the home court advantage and I would expect the same in the U.S.,\" Vandeweghe said.Vandeweghe broke in the opening games of both sets at Chizhovka Arena, and didn't face a break point on her serve in the opener.In the second set, Vandeweghe lost serve in the second and eighth games, but broke serve on three of four offerings to secure the match.Vandeweghe holds a perfect record in Fed Cup action this year, winning five singles and one doubles match including her defeat of Sasnovich.\"I think there's different moments that excite you in tennis,\" Vandeweghe said. \"For me, Fed Cup is probably one of the more exciting moments I could have in my career.\"I don't want to use the word 'ooze' confidence, but I can't think of a better word. I just take the energy that's around me and I really use it to my advantage.\"The Americans won a record 17th Fed Cup title in 2000, with Billie Jean King as captain.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)By Howard Fendrich, Associated PressJack Sock's 2017 did not always go as planned. Still, he's having quite a finish.He won a total of only three matches at Grand Slam tournaments all year, making it as far as the third round just once and bowing out in the opening round twice. During one particularly rough stretch from August to early October, he lost five times in a row.The 25-year-old American turned things around at the end of the season, so much so that he ended up earning a debut appearance at the ATP Finals, starting with a match against 19-time major champion Roger Federer on Sunday in London.\"It's hard when you have a bit of a period where it doesn't go as well as you would like. So he had to get back to doing the things he does really well and really believing in those things,\" Sock's coach, Jay Berger, said in a telephone interview.\"That's hitting a bunch of forehands, using his speed and using his intangibles,\" Berger said. \"His ability to come forward, his hands at the net, his ability to use his touch, his ability to hit pretty dynamic shots in very uncomfortable and difficult positions. And to have fun. The No. 1 thing for us was also to have fun out there. I told him, 'We're going to have a good time, win or lose.'\"In Wednesday's draw for the round-robin format, Sock was put in a group with Federer, 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic and Alexander Zverev. The other group has 15-time Grand Slam title winner Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Grigor Dimitrov and David Goffin.That Sock is in London at all, instead of already starting his offseason at home in Kansas City, Kansas, is significant, regardless of how he fares.He grabbed that spot by rising to a career-high No. 9 in the rankings thanks to his first Masters Series title, at Paris last week. That made him the first U.S. man to win a tournament at the level right below the majors since Andy Roddick in 2010. Sock is also the first American to qualify for the eight-player season-ending finals since Mardy Fish in 2011. And Sock will finish a season as the highest-ranked man from his country for the first time.All in one fell swoop.\"They were all, obviously, goals of mine. They all mean a lot in their own way,\" Sock said. \"For it all to happen at the same time is pretty special.\"He gives some of the credit for this recent surge to a mental adjustment helped along by Berger, who started working with Sock in July.For a time, Sock said, he would experience \"dips in matches (or) get too defensive.\"And now?\"There's a belief in my shots. I'm going to win or lose a match playing on my terms, playing my game, which is big and aggressive and trying to dictate points,\" he said. \"Not shying away from that.\"Berger recalled watching Sock play a match at age 17.\"I saw an unbelievable amount of racket-head speed. ... I really saw a lot of the same stuff that I see now,\" Berger said. \"And he has an incredible ability to play well in big moments.\"That was on display in Paris, sure, but also when Sock teamed with Melanie Oudin to win the U.S. Open mixed doubles title as a teenager.And when he won men's doubles at Wimbledon in 2014.And a pair of doubles medals at last year's Rio Olympics  gold in mixed, bronze in men's.Now Sock wants more consistency, and success, in singles, something he hopes this year's ending will help spur at the beginning of 2018.\"His best tennis is in front of him,\" Berger said. \"I've known him for many years, and the one thing consistent with him is that he always improves, every single year. I really haven't seen any regression in his tennis or how he approaches things or how he goes about his business. I know that is going to continue.\"",

(AP Photo/Adam Hunger)MINSK, Belarus (AP)  Sloane Stephens is back in the United States team for the Fed Cup final, and Victoria Azarenka is missing for Belarus.That alone gives the early advantage to the Americans.Stephens, who won the U.S. Open this year for her first major title, missed the opening two rounds of the international team competition because of a foot injury. But she is back and will be playing alongside CoCo Vandeweghe, Shelby Rogers and Alison Riske in the best-of-five series this weekend in Minsk.\"I'm happy to be back playing and happy the team made the finals,\" the 13th-ranked Stephens said Wednesday. \"It's awesome I can be on this team.\"The United States is looking to win the Fed Cup for the first time in 17 years, while Belarus is playing in the final for the first time.Stephens hasn't played in the Fed Cup since the 2016 quarterfinals, but she said it's been \"no problem at all\" slipping back onto the squad.\"Obviously, I've known these girls since I was 12-13 years old, so we're all really good friends,\" Stephens said. \"It's easy to be with girls you like, girls you have fun with and girls you've been around for a really long time.\"Stephens didn't play from the 2016 Olympics through Wimbledon in 2017 and underwent foot surgery during that period. She arrived in Minsk after not winning any of the four matches she's played since her surprise U.S. Open victory. She retired with a knee injury from her last match against Barbora Strycova in China last week.Vandeweghe, in her first week at a career-high No. 10 ranking, won two Fed Cup singles points against Germany in the quarterfinals, and two singles and the doubles points against the Czech Republic in the semifinals.But the U.S. Open semifinalist said she knows very little about this weekend's competition, having never played Aryna Sabalenka, Aliaksandra Sasnovich, Vera Lapko or Lidziya Marozava.\"I feel like I'm coming in with wool over my eyes a little bit,\" Vandeweghe said.Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, is not playing in the final because of an ongoing custody dispute with the father of her infant son.If U.S. captain Kathy Rinaldi wins the title, she would be the first female to do so since Billie Jean King led the Americans to the last of their record 17 titles in 2000.\"It would be a great honor to be named as another female (champion) captain alongside Billie Jean,\" said Rinaldi, who is in her first year as captain. \"I spoke to Billie Jean before I came over.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)GLASGOW, Scotland (AP)  Andy Murray believes he will be fit and ready to return to the ATP Tour by Dec. 31 at the Brisbane International.He also thinks results will not come quickly, and aiming for the Australian Open title might be too ambitious. But he's sure he'll be challenging for major honors next year.Murray hasn't played since the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he limped out with a hip injury.\"When I get back on the court next year and start playing again, it might not come immediately at the beginning of the year,\" he said on Tuesday before a charity match against Roger Federer in Glasgow.\"I have been hitting the ball very well in practice - it's just that there is a difference between that 75-80 percent practice and going flat out at 100 percent for 2 1/2 or three hours on the match court. Until I do that I can't say for certain, but I'll be able to come back just fine.\"The two-time Wimbledon champion plans on getting to Australia early to acclimatize in a bid to offset his lack of sharpness, but he will not feel compelled to play if he is not totally fit.\"Things have been going pretty well so far in the rehab, but you just never know,\" said Murray, whose medical team chose rest and recovery instead of surgery.\"I've been training for a few weeks now. Some days I've felt great and some days not so good. I probably made a bit of a mistake trying to get ready for the U.S. Open but it was the last major of the year and I wanted to give it a go. I'll come back when I'm ready.\"Federer reinforced that message. He had a similar layoff last year after struggling with knee problems and came back rejuvenated, winning his first Grand Slam event for five years at Wimbledon and following it up with a U.S. Open triumph.He told Murray: \"Take your time, however long it takes. When you come back you want to be at 100 percent, otherwise the problem is you feel you just can't beat the best at the big tournaments, so it's wise and worthwhile to take the extra week, extra month maybe.\"I'm sure Andy is going to have a lot of years left, so he shouldn't hurry, but as a professional athlete you always want to come back as quick as possible. You need to have goals but sometimes they need to be postponed.\"",

But she only played six matches this season and is currently ranked 208th.She hasn't competed anywhere since Wimbledon, where she lost to Simona Halep in the fourth round on July 10.Azarenka has said that she separated from her son's father shortly after that.She cited the custody dispute when she pulled out of the U.S. Open in August, saying then that it wasn't possible for her child to travel with her to New York for the Grand Slam tournament.Belarus hosts the United States in the best-of-five-match final at an indoor hard court in Minsk on Saturday and Sunday.Without Azarenka, the hosts will rely on Aryna Sabalenka, a 19-year-old ranked 78th, and Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who is ranked 87th. Belarus never has won a Fed Cup championship.U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, who is ranked 13th, leads the American team, along with No. 10 CoCo Vandeweghe, a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist. Shelby Rogers and Alison Riske are the other members of U.S. captain Kathy Rinaldi's roster.The U.S. is in its first Fed Cup final since losing to Italy in 2010. The Americans won the last of their record 17 titles in 2000.",

He was 89.Pacheco, who earned a medical degree from the University of Miami, met Ali in the early 1960s at Miami's Fifth Street Gym when the future icon was known as Cassius Clay and working with legendary trainer Angelo Dundee.Working in Ali's corner with Dundee in the 1960s, Pacheco kept his place in Ali's inner circle during most of the superstar's reign as boxing's heavyweight champion.Pacheco, an American of Cuban and Spanish heritage, played a key role in Ali's 1964 title fight against Sonny Liston.Ali's blood pressure rose at the weigh-in and Pacheco was asked to examine the fighter away from the rowdy atmosphere. Ali admitted to Pacheco he was acting \"crazy\" to scare Liston and when Pacheco examined him, Ali's reading was normal. He went on to win the fight.Pacheco became worried about the years of punches Ali absorbed and voiced his concern after the 1975 \"Thrilla in Manila\" when Ali kept his crown by defeating Joe Frazier.After Ali beat Earnie Shavers in 1977, Pacheco urged Ali to retire. When he didn't leave the ring, Pacheco left Ali's team.Ali's boxing career ended in 1981 and soon after he began a 32-year fight with Parkinson's disease until his death at age 74 in June 2016. Ali finished 56-5 with 37 wins by knockout.Pacheco, who became a television boxing analyst in the 1980s and 1990s, assisted Dundee with 12 boxing world champions in addition to Ali.  Rappler.com",

Nick Young sank two 3-pointers and a free throw in the run.Golden State led 44-27 after a 12-0 run in the second quarter. But the Celtics answered with a 15-3 run to close the second quarter, pulling within 47-42 at half-time, Brown scoring seven points to lead the spurt for Boston.The Celtics kept Golden State without a basket for more than five minutes to end the half, the Warriors missing their last eight shots.Gordon Hayward, whose season ended when he suffered a broken left leg in Boston's opener, sat behind the Celtics bench in his first game appearance since the injury.

But after a few moments of adjustment, the hard-hitting puncher from General Santos City connected with a right hand which began the ending for Ernesto Guerrero, putting him down for a count before a left hook to the body left him breathless.Referee Bruce McTavish reached the count of 10 with Guerrero still on all fours on Wednesday, November 15, moving Gaballos record to 17-0 with 15 knockouts.I am very happy to win in my USA debut. I will continue to work hard to reach my dream as a world champion, Gaballo, a raw but promising bantamweight prospect, said in a statement.The fight headlined a show promoted by Gabriel Bebot Elorde Jr, and Gaballos promoter Jim Claude Manangquil expects Gaballo to be back in the ring by February or March.Reymart Gaballo (17-0, 15KOs) knocked out Ernesto Guerrero in two rounds last night in his US debut in Honolulu. First KD was on a right hand, then body shot finished it #boxing pic.twitter.com/kj7JLd5ek5  Ryan Songalia (@ryansongalia) November 16, 2017It was an incremental step-up in class for Gaballo, as Guerrero (27-22, 19 KOs) was probably more of a junior bantamweight than 118-pounder, but had gone the 6-round distance with unbeaten Ruben Villa in California this past September in a featherweight fight. Gaballo appeared stiff at times, taking counter right hands when he jumped in with his guard low before finding the timing on his right hand.First fight abroad [in the USA], one year no fight with little experiencebut Im confident he will be more relaxed next time, said Manangquil, whose brother John Ray Manangquil manages Gaballo.Gaballo had been training in Miami with Osmiri Moro Fernandez since July as they work on rounding out his technique.The Gaballo fight is just the first of a busy next few weeks for Manangquils Sanman Promotions as he heads next to Las Vegas for Harmonito Dela Torre (19-0, 12 KOs) vs 2012 Olympic silver medalist Tugstsogt Nyambayar (8-0, 8 KOs) of Mongolia in a 10-round bout this Saturday at the Cosmopolitan, then off to Rhode Island for John Vincent Moralde (19-0, 10 KOs) vs Toka Kahn Clary (23-1, 16 KOs) in another 10-rounder in Providence.

Still No Offer.\"He sent Wilder, known as the 'Bronze Bomber', a link to an 18-minute YouTube interview in which he spoke of his desire to fight the American, who has said he would be prepared to fight Joshua in Britain.In an accompanying tweet, Joshua wrote: \"A little word on the @BronzeBomber fight.

In our previous two matches we also shared points with Yemen twice via 2-2 and 1-1 scores.After we manhandled the Nepalese 4-1 at home in March, this seemed to be an easy three points for the Philippines. Get the W, pop the champagne, and start looking for cheap flights to Dubai in 2019, where the final stage will be held.But it just wasn't to be for Thomas Dooley's men on a difficult afternoon.As I feared, this match proved to be a stumbling blockBack in January when the draw for the qualifying came out, I wrote these words here in Rappler, lamenting what I saw as an unfortunate draw.The way I see it there was no harder Pot 4 away game than Nepal, and that is exactly what we landed. The altitude and the travel make this game a true banana skin. Almost every other Pot 4 away game would have been a short hop away at sea level against a beatable team. True, an away match at Bhutan would have also meant difficult travel and a match at high altitude, but the Bhutanese are probably weaker than Nepal.That was how I felt in January. Last weekend I wrote a preview to this game talking a lot about the altitude in Nepal, and two guys I really respect in Pinoy football, Mikee Carrion, (who was the match analyst on ABS-CBN S+A,) and ex-Kaya coach Maor Rozen, reassured me that it might not be an issue.Rozen told me that up to 1500 meters above sea level, there is really nothing much to worry about with pro athletes. It's only higher than that where things become difficult. Carrion said that in South America some visiting teams to high-altitude matches sometimes deliberately come a day before so that their body doesn't have time to notice the thin air.Plus the weather was startlingly balmy, around 21 degrees celsius at kickoff, 2:15 pm local time. The sun was out too. I guess autumns in Nepal are really pleasant most of the time.By kickoff I was really liking our chances. Conditions seemed perfect for us to win.But it wasn't to be. The ground looked very firm on TV, and we seemed to have difficulty controlling the weight of our passes and first touches in the thin air. Nepal looked very organized in the back and limited our chances.The Azkals were not afraid to press in the first half. Perhaps we paid for it with some tiredness in the second? I would love to ask the players.In the end, luck was not on our side as two chances were cleared off the line and Carlie De Murga's last-gasp header clanged off the woodwork.Misagh Bahadoran was not fielded, and that likely means he just didn't have the fitness in the eyes of Dooley to get a run-out. Curt Dizon did well up top, stinging the palms of the Nepalese goalie.So in the end, this did turn out to be a tough game. Nepal is 60 places below us on the FIFA rankings, and they had nothing else but pride to play for. But it didn't matter much as we just couldn't crack them.We were without some key cogs but for me there was one injured Azkal that we missed the most....We really needed Manny OttThe center of the park was not the creative engine it could have been on Tuesday. Paul Mulders, Phil Younghusband, and Kevin Ingreso were unable to rule the middle third. There were too main aimless direct balls.Manny Ott, Mike's kuya, is out for a few months with an injured knee. We sorely needed his composure, passing touch and vision. He is that rare player with the ability to read defenses and break them down.Here's hoping that the Ceres man somehow makes it back for the March game against Tajikistan, and that the other injured Azkal talisman, Javi Patio, is upfield to receive his passes.Let's take a look at where we standOn Tuesday night Yemen and Tajikistan played to a 0-0 draw as well in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. I see this as a good development because it keeps both sides below us in the standings.The Pinoys have 9 points after two wins and three draws to lead the group. Yemen and Tajikistan are at 7 points. Two-point Nepal are out of the running for UAE in 2019.The top two in the group progress. On March 27 we tangle with Tajikistan at home and Yemen and Nepal play in the last set of group games. I gather that the favorite to host the match is Panaad again, but there has been no official announcement yet.A win against Tajikistan and we are top of the group and punch tickets to UAE. A draw will be good enough too. That gives us 10 points, and leaves the Tajiks stuck at 8, safely below us. In that scenario, Tajikistan needs Nepal to beat Yemen to give the Central Asians passage.It is still possible for us to qualify even if we lose. That brings Tajikistan to 10 and leaves us at 9. Nepal needs to either draw or beat the Yemenis, though, for us to back into the final stage in 2019.The nightmare scenario is if we fall to Tajikistan and Yemen beats Nepal. That leaves us with 9 points, a point less than the other two and out of the AFC Asian Cup.But aside from that possibility we are actually still in good shape. This nil-nil may not satisfy, but it nudges us ever so closer to the promised land of UAE in 2019.With no more Azkals play for the rest of the year, we need to give the PFL a lookThe first Philippines Football League season is nearing the finish line. The clubs in the four-team playoffs are already known. FC Meralco Manila, Ceres Negros, Kaya Makati and Global Cebu will participate, and it's only seedings that are at stake for the last few regular season games. For more information check out the league's Facebook page here. (https://www.facebook.com/PhilippinesFootballLeagueOfficial/)The two-legged semis will take place on December 2, 3, 9 and 10. The one-game final happens on December 16. The action should be intense.The Azkals may be done playing for their country this year, but you can now check out your favorite Pinoy footballers battle for their clubs.Follow Bob on Twitter @PassionateFanPH.

    "text": "Italy not being at the World Cup is a new experience for most of the country's fansPublished 10:28 AM, November 14, 2017ROME, Italy  Italy's failure to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years was greeted by a mixture of disbelief, dismay and resigned disappointment by fans across the country.In Rome's trendy San Lorenzo district, the Le Mura bar, which showed the playoff crunch on Monday, November 13, with Sweden on a big screen, emptied at the final whistle after a goalless stalemate which condemned the Azzurri to a 1-0 aggregate defeat.\"It is really very sad because watching the World Cup was something that really brought us together as Italians,\" said recent graduate Stefania Pusateri, heading for the exit.\"But what is sure is that the shock will be even worse for my father. He is 54 years old and he has never had to go through something like this.\"Sitting alongside Pusateri, friend Davide Penna concurred. \"I still can't believe it has happened,\" he said. \"We have never experienced anything like this. It's over.\"Similar sentiments were voiced by fans coming out of the San Siro stadium in Milan after Monday's 0-0 draw.\"I am disappointed with the whole football system in Italy,\" said Mirko Palmieri. \"It is the umpteenth failure of our country. Even here (at the San Siro), we can't get the job done.\"Italy not being at the World Cup will be a new experience for most of the country's fans, and few of them are looking forward to the experience of watching from the sidelines.The 4-time champions opted not to play at the first World Cup in 1930 but they have been present at every other edition apart from 1958, when they also failed to qualify.\"I was born with Italy being a part of the World Cup, and it has always been like that,\" one supporter told AFP on his way out of the Milan stadium.\"Tomorrow I will wake up and my life will go on but this summer I will do something else.\"Another added: \"The disappointment is a double one  first because we are not good, but second because we were beaten by a team that is even worse than us.\"'Completely unthinkable'Back in the Rome bar, the view that Italy deserved to be on the plane to Russia was disputed by journalism student Christian Dalenz.\"The reality is they were not good enough, they haven't earned the right to be at the World Cup. This is a very weak squad. It just does not have enough world-class players who can make the difference.\"The extent of the shock that non-qualification represents for Italian football was underlined by the pre-match confidence of most fans that Gigi Buffon and co. would pull through.\"It is not as if Sweden are that strong a team,\" Fabio Votano, a Roman who was only a toddler when Italy last missed out on a World Cup finals, had told AFPTV hours before kick-off.\"Not winning is completely unthinkable, basically something that has never happened before. For Italy, getting to the World Cup finals is almost a duty.\"Italy ended up in the playoffs as a result of finishing second in their qualifying group behind Spain.They then put in a sluggish performance in the first leg in Sweden, when the home side edged a scrappy, physical affair thanks to substitute Jakob Johansson's deflected shot just after the hour mark.Rome resident Enrico Doddi insisted Italy's players were good enough to have overcome Sweden.\"They're playing miserably at the moment but Italy still has a good set of players in my opinion,\" he said. \"It is all down to mentality.\"You cannot have a good World Cup without Italy.\"  Rappler.com",

    "text": "Can attitude conquer altitude? Philippines coach Thomas Dooley sure hopes soPublished 12:42 PM, November 12, 2017MANILA, Philippines  In their biggest match of the year, the Philippine Azkals face Nepal on Tuesday, November 14, 4:15 pm Philippine time, in a Group F clash in AFC Asian Cup qualifying. The venue is the ANFA Complex nestled in the rarefied air of Kathmandu, Nepal, 1400 meters above sea level.ABS-CBN S+A will air the game live on both their SD and HD channels, and will also livestream the match.The mission is simple for coach Thomas Dooley and his charges: win and a slot in the final stage of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the UAE is guaranteed. A draw or a loss, and the final qualifying game, on March 29 2018 at home versus Tajikistan, becomes key to progression.The Azkals have already defeated Nepal in this group, downing them 4-1 last March in Rizal Memorial. Dooley also oversaw a pair of 3-0 friendly wins against the Himalayans in 2014, both in Doha, Qatar.Nepal are 60 places adrift of us in the FIFA rankings at 176. They have a solitary point in this qualifying campaign, a home 0-0 draw against Yemen. On paper they should be a pushover.But this match is at altitude, and that makes all the difference. Dooley should know. He has had a firsthand experience of thin-air football as a player.The German-born American coach recounted a game he played for the USA on July 25, 1993 in Mexico City's fabled Azteca Stadium. The Azteca is a seething, inhospitable cauldron of noise for away teams. The game was the CONCACAF Gold Cup Final, the top prize for nations in North and Central America plus the Caribbean.Mexico City sits 2,200 meters above sea level, fully 800 meters higher than Kathmandu.Mexican Nacho Ambriz began the scoring in the 11th minute with a rocket of a free kick from over 30 yards out, igniting the crowd of over 100,000 Mexican supporters. You can see it 50 seconds into this video.\"One thing about playing in a high altitude is that the ball travels faster in the thin air,\" explains the coach.\"The ball was in the net even before our goalkeeper, Tony Meola, had his hands up.\"Mexico went on to win 4-0, and as Dooley recounts, the visitors really never had a chance.\"After 20 minutes, we were done,\" says the former centerback. \"We couldn't run, and we couldn't breathe.\"\"The key to playing in a high altitude is acclimatizing for 3 weeks. Then you'll be 100% ready,\" adds Dooley.\"Two weeks is okay, if you gradually increase the load in the training. One week is better than two days preparation, but it's not the same.\"4 years later the Americans would return to Azteca for a World Cup qualifier against their archrivals. This time the team prepared with a two-and-a-half week long camp in Big Bear, California, 2,058 meters above sea level.The camp worked. Despite an early red card, the Yanks hang on for a goalless draw, and qualified for the 1998 World Cup.Fast forward to 2017 and Dooley's current team. How much preparation time in Nepal do the Azkals have? Exactly one week. They flew out of Manila last Tuesday, November 7, at midnight for Abu Dhabi, then flew back east to Kathmandu.There was a plan to have the team acclimatize in Baguio before traveling but that was scotched, likely because of PFL commitments. Incidentally, at 1,540 meters up, Baguio is actually higher than Kathmandu.At least most of the big-name Azkals are slated to play. Neil Etheridge has flown in from Wales, where he plays for Cardiff City in the second tier of English football. We also have Daisuke Sato coming in from Denmark and Mike Ott from Thailand. Mike's brother Manny is out with a knee injury.The list of PFL players includes the Younghusband brothers from Davao, Hikaru Minegishi and Dennis Villanueva from Global, Iain Ramsay, Kevin Ingreso and Junior Muoz from Ceres, Curt Dizon from FC Meralco Manila, and Sean Kane from JPV Marikina. Returning to the team are Cebu's Misagh Bahadoran, who was injured during the last window, Kaya's Marwin Angeles, and Stallion midfielder Fitch Arboleda.I saw Bahadoran in Global's last game before this FIFA window, 4-3 victory over Stallion Laguna last week. Bahadoran, playing out of position as a holding mid, didn't quite look 100% fit, although he did play all 90 minutes. Let's hope the striker is in better shape come Tuesday.There are two brand-new homegrown Filipino Azkals in Nepal now, Global Cebu's Paolo Salenga, who has been finding the net often both in the PFL and the Singapore Cup, and Ceres Negros left back Joshua Dutosme. The latter's inclusion has raised plenty of eyebrows, since Dutosme, a University of St. La Salle product, has only been a pro since the last transfer window. It must be noted, however, that he hails from Malaybalay, Bukidnon, elevation: 622 meters above sea level.The PFL's top Filipino striker, Jhanjhan Melliza of Stallion, is unfortunately unavailable due to injury. Paul Mulders, who assisted Mike Ott for the late equalizer against Yemen last month, is listed in the team but is recovering from measles. It's not clear if he can play.As for the Nepal*, they may be out of the running already, but Dooley sees no reason to take them lightly.\"This will be a difficult game. Nepal are a physical team. They can run, they will fight. They might not be as skillful as us but they can do damage.\"You might recall that Nepal had a man sent off early against us in March for an egregious handball in front of goal. But the shorthanded team did pull back a goal before halftime.\"They know they have a chance at altitude,\" continues Dooley. \"They can run for 90 minutes. We might be dead after 20 or 30.\"As always, the coach will rely on team spirit to carry the day, as the Azkals stand on the precipice of Asian footballing glory.\"The attitude, the enthusiasm, the excitement from the players, it has to be there.\"Follow Bob on Twitter @PassionateFanPH*Editor's note: An earlier version of the article said \"Yemen\" instead of \"Nepal\" Rappler.com",

    "text": "Fans unfurl a large Hong Kong regional flag in the stands of Mong Kok Stadium while loud booing was heard during the broadcast of the Chinese national anthem. Some supporters turn their backs on the field.Published 3:41 PM, November 10, 2017HONG KONG, China  Defiant Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese national anthem at a home match against Bahrain Thursday, November 9, ahead of the implementation of a law making it illegal to disrespect the song.Hong Kong's government had on Saturday, November 4, said that China's new National Anthem Law will apply in the semi-autonomous territory, once authorities enact a local version of the legislation.Fans on Thursday night unfurled a large Hong Kong regional flag in the stands of Mong Kok Stadium while loud booing was heard during the broadcast of the Chinese national anthem, with some supporters turning their backs on the field.\"Basically we don't feel Chinese, we are Hongkongers,\" a fan, who wanted to remain anonymous, told AFP after he turned his back when the national anthem was played.He added that he was angered by the idea of the National Anthem Law.Kitson Wong, another fan, told AFP ahead of the match that he thought the law would \"seriously limit\" residents' freedom of speech.But some fans said it was pointless to continue disrespecting the anthem.\"The things you don't like won't disappear after you boo it,\" said 25-year-old Pius Chan, a lab technician.China passed legislation to punish anyone who disrespects the national anthem with up to three years in prison, state media reported on Saturday.It has been fine-tuning legislation on the proper way and place to sing its national anthem, recently tightening rules that already bar people from performing it at parties, weddings and funerals.The country in September passed a National Anthem Law applying to those on the mainland, which specified a much lesser jail term of 15 days for disrespecting the song.It was unclear which of the two laws would take precedence in cases involving alleged disrespect to the anthem.Hong Kong football fans have booed the anthem at matches for years, as concerns grow about the city's liberties coming under threat.Pro-Beijing politician Ip Kwok-Him said on Saturday that \"when this law is passed, people must stand, there must be a display of solemnity\".Ip, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, told a radio program on Saturday that people in the city would have to stop when they hear the anthem even if they were walking.Written in 1935 before the Communist Party took power and officially adopted in 1982, the buoyant, military-minded score calls on the Chinese people to \"march on\" toward the establishment of a new nation.

    "text": "Lyceum deserves to be applauded. After all, it is, amazing to jump from 9th place last year, to a losing finalist which earlier swept the elimination round this year.Published 6:29 PM, November 17, 2017MANILA, Philippines  Its just the tip of the iceberg for the Lyceum of the Philippines University Pirates.That is what coach Topex Robinson wants his wards to believe after the Pirates were swept by the San Beda College Red Lions in the best-of-3 NCAA Season 93 finals Thursday, November 16.After all, Lyceum finished at ninth place last year before undergoing a major revamp this season en route to the top spot with an unscathed 18-0 card.The Pirates were touted to be crowned the next NCAA kings following their season sweep but San Beda, which won its 21st NCAA title, banked on its championship experience to prevail.Despite the loss, Robinson chose to look at the silver lining that the experience they gained in the finals will be pivotal for their mission in the long run.If thats the result, Im still going to take that experience. We will carry on that experience as we go along on our journey to be one of the respected programs in the Philippine college basketball.The Lyceum faithful will have nothing to worry as the Pirates will maintain an intact core next season.Only Edcor Marata and Wilson Baltazar will graduate while Most Valuable Player CJ Perez, Mike Nzeusseu, the Marcelino twins of Jaycee and Jayvee and Jesper Ayaay will be returning next year for another potential run to the finals.The experience we gained here is just going to make us better. Its just going to make us a better team and most importantly, its going to make us better individuals, Robinson said.I told the team that were building a culture. The culture is not an overnight thing, its a compilation of years and years of what were doing. Were excited for what lies ahead of us and I always tell them its just the tip of the iceberg for us. We have so many basketball to play and so many people to inspire.The veteran tactician added that if losing this season resulted in earning peoples respect, he would gladly take it.With the people that texted us, even the San Beda alumni that came up to me, You guys really played well. Thats more important to me than winning. The respect, the coaches from the other team, the respect that we gained I guess something could overcome winning. Im excited for today. I know a lot of friendship will be made. Im excited for that.Whats next for the Pirates? It is going back to classes, Robinson said.  Rappler.com",

    "text": "Robert Bolick's 3-pointers down the homestretch for the San Beda Red Lions were the daggers which pierced the hearts of the fierce Lyceum PiratesPublished 3:00 PM, November 17, 2017MANILA, Philippines  It all came full circle for Robert Bolick as he willed the San Beda College Red Lions to their 21st NCAA title against the Lyceum of the Philippines University Pirates on Thursday, November 16.Bolick provided the boost the Red Lions needed to stave off the Pirates in Game 2 of the best-of-3 finale, knocking down a gritty triple with only 50 seconds left that virtually closed all doors for a possible Lyceum comeback, 89-82.San Beda swept the championship series with a 92-82 Game 2 win and even though it was Donald Tankoua who was crowned finals Most Valuable Player, it was Bolick who always delivered the finishing blow which kept the Pirates at bay.During Game 1, Bolick buried a backbreaking triple to cap off a personal 8-0 run that put the Red Lions up 91-82 with only 35 seconds remaining en route to the victory.In two games of the finals, he scored 20 of his 42 total points in the final quarter alone.But if there is someone to thank for his improved outside sniping, it would ironically be the Pirates.Since the start of the season kasi coach Boyet (Fernandez) told us to shoot before the start of the training and medyo hindi ko ginagawa. He always tells me na You cant shoot from the outside, the 3-point shot, and from that day na natalo kami sa Lyceum when I missed my free throws, I took it personal, said the Ormoc City-native.(Since the start of the season, coach Boyet told us to shoot before the start of the training but I did not really comply. He always told me that I couldn't shoot from the outside and from that day that we lost to Lyceum, because I missed my free throws, I took it personal.)When the two teams first met, Bolicks statline of 21 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists was not enough as the Red Lions surrendered a 91-96 decision to the Pirates.Things got worse the second time with Lyceum pulling off a 107-105 squeaker to end the eliminations with a perfect 18-0 card. In that game, Bolick still finished with 16 points but missed 13 of his 17 shots and turned the ball over 6 times.Sabi nila, wala daw akong shooting. (They say I dont shoot the ball that well.) From that day on, every after practice, I shoot 7 spots 20 made each. I always visualize na maybe, you know, its always going to be close games and I have to practice where I will take a shot and saan ako komportable to make that 3.Now with back-to-back NCAA titles under his belt, Bolick is not stopping on his chase for more championships with the Red Lions especially that he decided to stay one more year in Mendiola instead of pursuing a professional career.I can already apply for the draft, but I think its my responsibility to keep one more year for San Beda for the way they treat me, galing pa lang sa teachers, sa fathers, tao sa cafeteria, mga guards, kahit kung sino sino lang doon. (The teachers, the fathers, the people in the cafeteria, the guards, the people there.) Youre inspired to play for them.  Rappler.com",

They sacrificed for about 11 months and we know in the course of our season, people doubted us but the circle of this team never doubted each other,\" said San Beda coach Boyet Fernandez.Donald Tankoua, who was named finals Most Valuable Player, followed up his magnificent Game 1 performance with a 17-point and 17-rebound showing while Davon Potts was still steady with 15 markers and 5 boards.Javee Mocon made his presence felt for San Beda with 14 points, 6 boards and 3 assists while AC Soberano added 11 points, highlighted by a triple late in the game that put the Red Lions up 86-82, to go with 3 steals.The Red Lions played catch up basketball throughout as they trailed by as much as 11 points but banked on their championship experience in the fourth quarter to exact revenge on Lyceum, which swept them in the elimination round.Season MVP CJ Perez paced the Pirates with 22 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds and 3 steals but was kept scoreless in the deciding quarter.Mike Nzeusseu had 15 points, 15 rebounds and 2 blocks for Lyceum while Jaycee Marcelino chipped in 12 markers, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals.Despite the loss, barging into the finals behind an undefeated run in the elimination round was still an astounding accomplishment for the Pirates, who joined the league as a guest team in Season 87.Scores:San Beda (92): Bolick 18, Tankoua 17, Potts 15, Mocon 14, Soberano 11, Abuda 5, Bahio 5, Presbitero 3, Doliguez 2, Noah 2, Tongco 0, Adamos 0Lyceum (82): Perez 22, Nzeusseu 15, Marcelino Jaycee 12, Ayaay 7, Caduyac 6, Santos 6, Tansingco 5, Marcelino Jayvee 4, Pretta 2, Serrano 2, Ibanez 1, Baltazar 0Quarter scores: 17-22, 41-47, 65-66, 92-82 Rappler.com",

    "text": "Mapua's win sends it to a sudden-death game against La Salle Green Hills for the NCAA Season 93 boy's basketball finalsPublished 5:27 PM, November 16, 2017MANILA, Philippines  The Mapua University Red Robins relied on Clint Escamis fourth quarter heroics to keep their title-retention bid alive following a 91-81 win over the La Salle Green Hills Greenies in Game 2 of the best-of-3 NCAA Season 93 boys basketball finals at the Araneta Coliseum Thursday, November 16.Escamis poured in 10 of his game-high 25 points in the payoff period to keep the Red Robins afloat against the surging Greenies, who erased a 13-point deficit and tied the game at 67-all heading into the final period.Mapua did not face much problems amid Most Valuable Player Will Gozums early fourth quarter exit due to foul trouble as Escamis scored 6 points in an 11-1 run that gave the Red Robins 78-68 lead.The Greenies went within 5 points, 81-86, thanks to a Joshua Marcos triple with 1:23 left in the game but Escamis, who also had 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals and 1 block, converted back-to-back layups to prevent the comeback.Sinabi ko lang na stay aggressive, possession by possession, wag nating madaliin. Ganoon yung naging problema namin noong Game 1 eh, said Mapua coach Randy Alcantara. Siguro mas gusto namin ngayon, mas malaki yung puso ng mga naglaro ngayon.(I just told the players to stay aggressive and not to rush the game since that became our problem in Game 1. Maybe we just wanted it more and they played with more heart today.)Warren Bonifacio made his presence felt with 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Red Robins while Erick Jabel added 17 points, highlighted by 3 straight buckets in the last period, 7 boards and 4 assists and was plus-17 the whole game.The Greenies were down by 9 points at the start of the third period, 46-55, before tying the game at 67-all behind Joel Cagulangans back-to-back triples.Cagulangan had a team-high 16 points, 9 assists and 3 rebounds but shot a dismal 31 percent and committed 10 turnovers. Marcos and Joshua David conjoined for 24 points and 14 rebounds.Game 3 will be on Tuesday, Nov. 21, at the same venue.Scores:Mapua (91): Escamis 25, Bonifacio 18, Jabel 17, Gozum 10, Garcia 8, Enriquez 6, Lacap 4, Dennison 3, Ramos 0, Sarias 0, Socias 0LSGH (81): Cagulangan 16, David 12, Marcos 12, Lepalam 10, Mosqueda 9, Perez 9, Sangco 5, Morales 4, Lao 4, Belgica 0, Pedrosa 0, Dela Cruz 0, Cruz 0Quarter scores: 25-19, 55-46, 67-67, 91-81 Rappler.com",

    "text": "When all seemed lost, it was the UST fans  the school community  who never gave up and pushed the Growling Tigers to win their last game of the seasonPublished 6:02 PM, November 12, 2017Last October 25, the Adamson University (AdU) Soaring Falcons handed the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Growling Tigers their 11th straight loss for UAAP Season 80. Of course, the recurring storyline of the season was the Tigers historic struggles under often-criticized head coach Boy Sablan, so the loss was nothing new at that point.However, that particular game made headlines after a photo circulated online of Isaac Coloma, a UST student standing all alone in the stands during the singing of the school hymn.According to comments posted by Coloma himself on the Growling Tigers page, numerous UST players thanked him personally online for still showing up to the game despite the winless season.But today, if Coloma was watching live, cameras couldnt spot him this time. However, that is probably what he wanted to happen. For today, hundreds of fans circled the stands of the Araneta Coliseum, bringing along signs like Viva Santo Tomas which havent been seen since the Tigers fought in the UAAP finals two years ago. There were also new signs like 1-13 from fans hoping that their team wouldnt go down for the year without a victory.In front of the hundreds who hoped, the Growling Tigers delivered, winning 88-85 over the University of the East (UE) Red Warriors. The 17-game losing streak dating back to last year had been broken, and UST avoided the first winless season in school history.More importantly, however, Go Uste! rang out to the rafters once again.Much like UST itself, the iconic chant had already become an institution  a treasure that was lost in the three months that this season ran. For these three months during games, the UST drummers would repeatedly signal the beginning of the chant, only to be answered by the echoes of their own voices.One would probably think that the players had not been affected with the loss of their imposing and feared sixth man, the fan base. After all, its all about playing the game. But Sidney Goldstein, a 15-year basketball coach and author, argues otherwise.Emotion is a big part of the game. In a psychological sense, emotion is the driving force behind everything that we do, said Goldstein in a 2003 article titled Emotion as Part of the Basketball Game.The Growling Tigers proved this by flocking to thank Coloma. Players like Marvin Lee, Justin Arana and even Steve Akomo who struggled with his English, took the time to write heartfelt messages of appreciation.The fans returning for the Tigers last game was especially helpful for the graduating Jeepy Faundo, who took the time to thank them before leaving the arena for the last time as a player.Ang masasabi ko lang sa kanila ay thank you kasi sa last game, kahit ganun yung nangyari sa team, may naniniwala pa rin samin na manalo, he said. Tsaka yung game na yun, dinedicate namin sa kanila, kay God at sa UST community na sumuporta at nagbigay ng time para panoorin yung last game namin.(I can only say thank you to them because in the last game, even though thats what happened to the team, there are still people who believe we can win. We also dedicate that game to them, to God and to the UST community who supported us and gave time to watch our last game.)The wins and losses come and go, but the fans who come to games and support their teams will always be the players emotional bedrock. Theyre there to celebrate with the wins and comfort with the losses. Without them, playing basketball seems to lose a lot of meaning.  Rappler.com",

    "text": "Lyceum coach Robinson says 'its my fault, I made some bad decisions, bad coaching, Ill try to lead them better come game 2' after the Pirates absorbed a 94-87 loss to San BedaPublished 11:00 AM, November 11, 2017MANILA, Philippines  Head coach Topex Robinson is not blaming anyone but himself after the Lyceum of the Philippines University suffered its first loss of Season 93 in Game 1 of the best-of-3 finals but vowed to do a better job next time as the Pirates look to fight for dear life against the San Beda College.After sweeping the Red Lions in the elimination round en route to an immaculate 18-0 card, the Pirates were the obvious favorites to win the championship this season.It was not the case Friday, November 10, as Lyceum absorbed an 87-94 defeat from the Red Lions in front of a raucous crowd at the Araneta Coliseum.The Pirates failed to find an answer for Donald Tankoua, who had a monster double-double of 27 points and 20 rebounds, and Robert Bolick, who scored 11 of his 24 points in the payoff period.But Robinson, in a presser after the game, owed complete responsibility for the loss and repeatedly apologized.Just like what I told them, its my fault, I made some bad decisions, bad coaching, Ill try to lead them better come game 2. My players played well, they really did well and Im sorry, its my fault. Ill be a better coach next game, said Robinson.At the end of the day, it is really my responsibility to find ways to win. Whatever the result is at the end of the day, its my head. I made a mistake and Im sorry and we will try to work on that, those mismatches and try to find ways to cover that.Lyceum wreaked havoc on the defensive end by forcing San Beda to commit 19 turnovers, which the Pirates converted to 25 points, but was outhustled on the rebounding department as the Red Lions finished with 16 more caroms.Robinson told his team that they were rookies compared to San Beda, which played its 12th straight finals, but said they have no excuses when they play in Game 2.We really lost to a better team and just like what I always tell this guys, this is not going to define us just because of the loss, whats going to define as a team is how we are going to bounce back.Game 2 of the finals will be on Thursday, November 16, at the same venue.

    "text": "All 3 UCLA players LiAngelo Ball  the younger brother of LA Lakers rookie star Lonzo Ball  Cody Riley and Jalen Hill admit guilt and thank US President Donald Trump for helping secure their releasePublished 1:53 PM, November 16, 2017LOS ANGELES, United States  Three US college basketball players detained in China for shoplifting publicly apologized Wednesday and thanked President Donald Trump for helping secure their release.Trump had personally asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to intervene to free UCLA's LiAngelo Ball -- the younger brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie star Lonzo Ball -- and teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, who were arrested last Tuesday in Hangzhou.The trio were held on suspicion of stealing from a Louis Vuitton store and later freed on bail but ordered to remain in the picturesque Chinese city.Shoplifting can bring jail time in China depending on the value of the goods.On Wednesday, all three admitted their guilt at a news conference in Los Angeles, one day after returning home.\"I take full responsibilities for the mistake that I made, shoplifting. I know that this goes beyond me letting my school down but I let the entire country down,\" said Riley.\"Before I thank everybody who worked so incredibly hard helping us returning home safely, I want to thank the Chinese government and the police for taking care of us. And to President Trump and the United States government, thank you for taking the time to intervene on our behalf.\"Ball told reporters he had not exercised his \"best judgment\" and vowed never to repeat the \"stupid decision\" to steal, also thanking Trump, as well as the Chinese police and UCLA.\"This does not define who I am. My family raised me better than that and I am going to make myself a better person from here on out,\" he added.Hill told reporters he wanted to be known for his love of basketball rather than \"this dumb mistake.\"\"This incident has changed me in a way that I cannot describe. I have so much more respect from the people around me from coaches and staff and the fans of UCLA,\" he said.UCLA head coach Steve Alford said the trio had been suspended indefinitely and would not travel with the team or suit up for home games.Alford thanked \"President Trump and his administration for their nonstop efforts\" in resolving the case.Earlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted about his role in urging Xi to secure the trio's release.\"Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!\" Trump mused.The case drew attention in the United States due to the involvement of Ball, one of three high-profile basketball-playing sons of LaVar Ball.The elder Ball has become a media personality by aggressively promoting his sons as future NBA superstars and had travelled to China on the trip to promote his Big Baller Brand shoe and apparel line.

That forced the 25-year-old guard to miss Sunday's 95-94 victory over Toronto.A plastic protective mask allowed Irving onto the court against the Nets and he responded by hitting 8-of-20 from the field and 7-of-8 from the free throw line as all five Boston starters scored in double figures\"It's a piece of plastic on your face,\" Irving said. \"It's the difference in having something over your face. It's almost like having somewhat foggy blinders on.\"When I take off the mask, I can see everything. When I have the mask on, I'm really dialed into what's in front of me, my peripherals are a little cut off, but it's just something you get you used to.\"Irving, who joined the Celtics in an off-season trade with Cleveland, wore a mask for 19 games with the Cavaliers in the 2012-13 season.\"Just wearing a mask for precautionary reasons,\" Irving said. \"Hopefully, it'll get better in the next few weeks.\"When Tuesday's game was over, Irving pulled the mask of his face and saluted Boston fans who were chanting \"M-V-P, M-V-P,\"  for Most Valuable Player  at him.\"I don't worry about him getting a rhythm too much,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \"He'll find that and obviously he made huge plays late in the game again.\"Marcus Morris added 21 points and 10 rebounds while Al Horford contributed 17 points and 11 rebounds for Boston and called Irving's return \"great\" for the Celtics.\"Just finding his way and doing what he does, making big plays for us, coming through and sealing the game,\" Horford said.The Celtics have not lost since dropping their home opener to Milwaukee on October 18, a night after Gordon Hayward was lost for the season with a horrendous knee injury in an opening-night loss at Cleveland.Raptors down Rockets, 129-113At Houston, Toronto's DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points to lead six Raptors in double figures as the Canadian club downed the host Rockets 129-113, snapping Houston's six-game win streak.Kyle Lowry and C.J. Miles scored 19 points each for Toronto, Miles coming off the bench to sink 6-of-9 shots from 3-point range.James Harden led Houston (11-4) with 38 points and 11 assists, going 19-of-19 from the free throw line.Spurs kick Mavericks, 97-91At Dallas, LaMarcus Aldridge scored 32 points and Australian guard Patty Mills added 19 to spark the San Antonio Spurs over the Dallas Mavericks 97-91.The Spurs, still playing without star French guard Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard, improved to 9-5.

But unnamed sources told People magazine and the Daily Mail that some 250 guests were invited to the festivities at the southern US city's Contemporary Arts Center.Music royalty Beyonce, legendary Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, actress Eva Longoria and singer Ciara were all also seen arriving at the arts complex.Security for the event, anticipated to last into the wee hours, was tight. An entire block in the Big Easy  a city known for its jazz music, good food and party atmosphere  was closed to traffic.A steady train of black SUVs brought members of the wedding party to the event, as workers hurried final preparations for the festivities.According the entertainment website ETonline, the wedding was to have a \"Beauty and the Beast\" theme. It said the tennis star's sister Venus was seen late Wednesday leaving the arts center.Workers could be seen early Thursday transforming the arts complex for the ceremony, while the parking lot beside the building was full of tents and trucks unloading flowers, tables, carpets, wardrobe, and musicians.The locally popular New Orleans funk and jazz band Naughty Professor was seen arriving in the late afternoon, as was the traditional Paulin Brothers Brass Band.Chefs cooked in an outdoor tent, with feasting options including two food trucks as well as an outdoor bar.The Daily Mail said the event would cost more than $1 million and guests would be asked not to bring their cell phones, because an exclusive photo deal had been signed with Vogue.Williams, 36, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, and Ohanian, 34, welcomed their first child, daughter Alexis Olympia, on September 1.They announced their engagement in December after meeting in 2015 in Rome.While New Orleans was no stranger to celebrities and weddings, the star wattage Thursday stirred up extra excitement in the city.Linda Davis and Cora Riley drove four hours from the small Louisiana town of DeRidder just to get a glimpse of the tennis champion. They waited outside the arts complex for hours.\"We love her. She's classy. She and Venus. They never complain,\" Riley told AFP.\"We're so glad she found happiness. Little baby Alexis is so precious,\" said Mary Huber, who was among a small group who took a break from work to observe the hectic scene.Williams won this year's Australian Open while pregnant, and is expected to defend her title in Melbourne in 2018  just four-and-a-half months after giving birth to her child.The Contemporary Arts Center is a large, four-story, multi-disciplinary complex boasting approximately 10,000 square feet (929 square meters) of gallery space.

    "text": "Rafa's right knee injury from Paris Masters costs him the chance to earn his first ATP Finals titlePublished 10:44 AM, November 14, 2017LONDON, United Kingdom  Rafael Nadal pulled out of the ATP Finals on Monday, November 13, admitting he had lost his fitness battle after crashing to defeat in 3 sets to David Goffin in a thrilling encounter.The world number one dug deep but was stunned 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (4/7), 6-4 by Goffin in his opening match of the end-of-season finale, which he has never won in his illustrious career.The Spaniard came into the tournament with doubts swirling over his fitness after pulling out of the Paris Masters with a knee injury.Initially he showed no obvious ill-effects during a rollercoaster round-robin encounter in front of a supportive crowd but eventually his injury caught up with him and forced him to admit his season is over.\"No, I am off,\" said Nadal. \"My season is finished. Yeah, I had the commitment with the event, with the city, with myself. I tried hard. I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play. But I am really not ready to play.\"\"Is about the pain,\" he added. \"I cannot hold with enough power to keep playing. I tried, but seriously it was a miracle to be very close in the score during the match. It really doesn't make sense.\"Nadal said he would work hard to be ready for the start of the next season.\"I know what I have to do,\" he said. \"I know all the things that happened in the past when I had these things, and I know the treatment that I had to do. I know the periods of time that I need to work. Then if the treatment works or not, we will see.\"Nadal, 31, struggled to find his range early in front of a raucous crowd rooting for him and was broken twice in the first set by the Belgian 7th seed, who had lost their previous two encounters.The Spaniard appeared to have earned a psychological edge when Goffin double-faulted while serving for the set and the match went into a tie-break but the Belgian re-found his focus to come out on top.The second set went with serve until the 8th game, when Goffin broke to earn a chance to serve for the match, only for Nadal to break back.Goffin had a golden chance to seal the match in Nadal's next service game but failed to put away a mid-court forehand on match point and the left-hander leveled at 5-5.The Belgian composed himself to hold and then earned 3 more match points but Nadal, showing incredible grit and playing right at the limit, saved all 3 to take it to another tie-break, which he won.DiscomfortIn the decider, Nadal appeared to feel discomfort in his right knee as he went two breaks down but still he refused to admit defeat, recovering a break before eventually succumbing.\"It was a tough fight until the end,\" said a relieved Goffin.\"Rafa is one of the strongest players mentally on the tour. I am so happy to finally find the key to win this match. It is so special to do it here.\"Nadal has won 75 singles titles in his illustrious career, including 16 Grand Slams and 30 Masters events but he has yet to triumph at the ATP Finals, played on quick indoor courts rather than his favored clay.Earlier, also in the Pete Sampras group, Grigor Dimitrov held his nerve to beat Dominic Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 7-5.The elegant Bulgarian had the edge for most of an enthralling contest of one-handed backhands but admitted he felt \"pretty nervous\" in his first appearance at the ATP Finals.The 6th seed, who has enjoyed the best season of his career, looked wobbly as he blew his chance to serve for the match at 5-4 in the decider only to hit back immediately as Thiem himself faltered and going on to seal victory on his 3rd match point.The ATP Finals feature the top 8 fit male singles players and doubles teams that have accrued the most points throughout the 2017 season.

Jaylen Brown scored 18 points, Terry Rozier scored 16, Marcus Smart with 14 and rookie Jayson Tatum delivered 13 points and 7 rebounds.The Celtics are the first team in NBA history with a double-digit win streak while having more than 4 rookies on their roster. Tatum is the most prominent of the 6 rookies contributing to the team's remarkable early season success.\"It's unbelievable ... we are playing good teams too,\" Rozier said.The Raptors had a chance to win the game in the final seconds as DeMar DeRozan went one-on-one with Brown but his shot at the buzzer clanged off the rim.Boston held on despite not scoring a basket over the final 86 seconds.Guard Irving could return soon as he spent the weekend visiting a specialist to be fitted for a playing mask to protect the facial fracture which has been described as minor. Doctors say there is no sign of a concussion, said coach Brad Stevens.\"The good news is thus far that's the only point of pain in his face or head or neck or anything else,\" said Stevens.Irving scored a then-career-high 41 points the last time he wore a mask in December 2012 while playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers.DeRozan led the Raptors, who fell to 7-5 on the season, with 24 points for his 7th straight 20-point game.\"They are the best team in the NBA right now and they are playing unbelievable,\" Toronto's Kyle Lowry said. \"Everybody is picking up slack.\"Lowry scored 19 points and dished out 7 assists and CJ Miles was the only other Raptor in double figures with 10 points.Lowry passed Andrea Bargnani to move into 4th place on the Raptors' all-time scoring list.Rockets rompElsewhere, James Harden had 26 points and a season-high 15 assists to lead the Houston Rockets to a 118-95 rout of the Indiana Pacers.Harden hit 9-of-21 shots from the field, fellow guard Eric Gordon chipped in with 21 points, and center Clint Capela contributed 20 points and a team-high of 17 rebounds.It was the 6th consecutive victory for the Rockets, who led throughout.Victor Oladipo led the Pacers with 28 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field.In Detroit, Tobias Harris led 5 players in double figures with 25 points to help the Pistons earn a 112-103 win over the Miami Heat and finish unbeaten on the 5-game homestand.

After all, it is, amazing to jump from 9th place last year, to a losing finalist which earlier swept the elimination round this year.Published 6:29 PM, November 17, 2017MANILA, Philippines  Its just the tip of the iceberg for the Lyceum of the Philippines University Pirates.That is what coach Topex Robinson wants his wards to believe after the Pirates were swept by the San Beda College Red Lions in the best-of-3 NCAA Season 93 finals Thursday, November 16.After all, Lyceum finished at ninth place last year before undergoing a major revamp this season en route to the top spot with an unscathed 18-0 card.The Pirates were touted to be crowned the next NCAA kings following their season sweep but San Beda, which won its 21st NCAA title, banked on its championship experience to prevail.Despite the loss, Robinson chose to look at the silver lining that the experience they gained in the finals will be pivotal for their mission in the long run.If thats the result, Im still going to take that experience. We will carry on that experience as we go along on our journey to be one of the respected programs in the Philippine college basketball.The Lyceum faithful will have nothing to worry as the Pirates will maintain an intact core next season.Only Edcor Marata and Wilson Baltazar will graduate while Most Valuable Player CJ Perez, Mike Nzeusseu, the Marcelino twins of Jaycee and Jayvee and Jesper Ayaay will be returning next year for another potential run to the finals.The experience we gained here is just going to make us better. Its just going to make us a better team and most importantly, its going to make us better individuals, Robinson said.I told the team that were building a culture. The culture is not an overnight thing, its a compilation of years and years of what were doing. Were excited for what lies ahead of us and I always tell them its just the tip of the iceberg for us. We have so many basketball to play and so many people to inspire.The veteran tactician added that if losing this season resulted in earning peoples respect, he would gladly take it.With the people that texted us, even the San Beda alumni that came up to me, You guys really played well. Thats more important to me than winning. The respect, the coaches from the other team, the respect that we gained I guess something could overcome winning. Im excited for today. I know a lot of friendship will be made. Im excited for that.Whats next for the Pirates? It is going back to classes, Robinson said.  Rappler.com",

But unnamed sources told People magazine and the Daily Mail that some 250 guests were invited to the festivities at the southern US city's Contemporary Arts Center.Music royalty Beyonce, legendary Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, actress Eva Longoria and singer Ciara were all also seen arriving at the arts complex.Security for the event, anticipated to last into the wee hours, was tight. An entire block in the Big Easy  a city known for its jazz music, good food and party atmosphere  was closed to traffic.A steady train of black SUVs brought members of the wedding party to the event, as workers hurried final preparations for the festivities.According the entertainment website ETonline, the wedding was to have a \"Beauty and the Beast\" theme. It said the tennis star's sister Venus was seen late Wednesday leaving the arts center.Workers could be seen early Thursday transforming the arts complex for the ceremony, while the parking lot beside the building was full of tents and trucks unloading flowers, tables, carpets, wardrobe, and musicians.The locally popular New Orleans funk and jazz band Naughty Professor was seen arriving in the late afternoon, as was the traditional Paulin Brothers Brass Band.Chefs cooked in an outdoor tent, with feasting options including two food trucks as well as an outdoor bar.The Daily Mail said the event would cost more than $1 million and guests would be asked not to bring their cell phones, because an exclusive photo deal had been signed with Vogue.Williams, 36, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, and Ohanian, 34, welcomed their first child, daughter Alexis Olympia, on September 1.They announced their engagement in December after meeting in 2015 in Rome.While New Orleans was no stranger to celebrities and weddings, the star wattage Thursday stirred up extra excitement in the city.Linda Davis and Cora Riley drove four hours from the small Louisiana town of DeRidder just to get a glimpse of the tennis champion. They waited outside the arts complex for hours.\"We love her. She's classy. She and Venus. They never complain,\" Riley told AFP.\"We're so glad she found happiness. Little baby Alexis is so precious,\" said Mary Huber, who was among a small group who took a break from work to observe the hectic scene.Williams won this year's Australian Open while pregnant, and is expected to defend her title in Melbourne in 2018  just four-and-a-half months after giving birth to her child.The Contemporary Arts Center is a large, four-story, multi-disciplinary complex boasting approximately 10,000 square feet (929 square meters) of gallery space.

Thats all she wrote for Team Philippines in the 2017 Southeast Asian Games here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.The Philippines crashes to its worst SEA Games finish since 1999, when the country hauled 20 gold medals in Brunei.This years delegation of over 400 athletes fails to match its 29-gold medal output from 2015 and 2013, despite its target of 50 gold medals.It has been a steady decline of gold medals for the Philippines since it last hosted the games in 2005.Despite the struggle with garnering gold medals, Filipino athletes still had their shining moments in victory.Mary Joy Tabal collected the countrys first gold in the marathon event, while Dines Dumaan won the last Philippine gold in pencak silat.Other gold winners come from triathlon, gymnastics, pool, men's 200- and 400-meter dash, 400-meter hurdles, boxing, men's basketball, women's wushu, women's judo, fencing, decathlon, ice hockey, taekwondo, lawn bowls, billiards, and equestrian.Many Filipino athletes, however, suffered painful defeats, including Rio Olympians Nestor Colonia and Kirstie Alora.The Philippines winds up in 6th place for the second straight SEA Games. By contrast, host Malaysia collects a whopping 145 gold medals, along with 92 silvers, and 86 bronze medals.Thailand comes in second with 72 golds. Vietnam has 58 golds and barely edges out Singapores 57, while Indonesia picks up 38 gold medals.The Philippines will have another shot at redemption when it again hosts the Southeast Asian Games in 2019. The preparations are already underway with plans to finally breathe life into the floundering Philippine sports program. Filipino athletes will continue to do the best they can but they will need all the support they can get  in 2019 and beyond.Jane Bracher, Rappler, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Rappler.com",

When he didn't leave the ring, Pacheco left Ali's team.Ali's boxing career ended in 1981 and soon after he began a 32-year fight with Parkinson's disease until his death at age 74 in June 2016.

    "text": "Lyceum deserves to be applauded. After all, it is, amazing to jump from 9th place last year, to a losing finalist which earlier swept the elimination round this year.Published 6:29 PM, November 17, 2017MANILA, Philippines  Its just the tip of the iceberg for the Lyceum of the Philippines University Pirates.That is what coach Topex Robinson wants his wards to believe after the Pirates were swept by the San Beda College Red Lions in the best-of-3 NCAA Season 93 finals Thursday, November 16.After all, Lyceum finished at ninth place last year before undergoing a major revamp this season en route to the top spot with an unscathed 18-0 card.The Pirates were touted to be crowned the next NCAA kings following their season sweep but San Beda, which won its 21st NCAA title, banked on its championship experience to prevail.Despite the loss, Robinson chose to look at the silver lining that the experience they gained in the finals will be pivotal for their mission in the long run.If thats the result, Im still going to take that experience. We will carry on that experience as we go along on our journey to be one of the respected programs in the Philippine college basketball.The Lyceum faithful will have nothing to worry as the Pirates will maintain an intact core next season.Only Edcor Marata and Wilson Baltazar will graduate while Most Valuable Player CJ Perez, Mike Nzeusseu, the Marcelino twins of Jaycee and Jayvee and Jesper Ayaay will be returning next year for another potential run to the finals.The experience we gained here is just going to make us better. Its just going to make us a better team and most importantly, its going to make us better individuals, Robinson said.I told the team that were building a culture. The culture is not an overnight thing, its a compilation of years and years of what were doing. Were excited for what lies ahead of us and I always tell them its just the tip of the iceberg for us. We have so many basketball to play and so many people to inspire.The veteran tactician added that if losing this season resulted in earning peoples respect, he would gladly take it.With the people that texted us, even the San Beda alumni that came up to me, You guys really played well. Thats more important to me than winning. The respect, the coaches from the other team, the respect that we gained I guess something could overcome winning. Im excited for today. I know a lot of friendship will be made. Im excited for that.Whats next for the Pirates? It is going back to classes, Robinson said.  Rappler.com",

But unnamed sources told People magazine and the Daily Mail that some 250 guests were invited to the festivities at the southern US city's Contemporary Arts Center.Music royalty Beyonce, legendary Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, actress Eva Longoria and singer Ciara were all also seen arriving at the arts complex.Security for the event, anticipated to last into the wee hours, was tight. An entire block in the Big Easy  a city known for its jazz music, good food and party atmosphere  was closed to traffic.A steady train of black SUVs brought members of the wedding party to the event, as workers hurried final preparations for the festivities.According the entertainment website ETonline, the wedding was to have a \"Beauty and the Beast\" theme. It said the tennis star's sister Venus was seen late Wednesday leaving the arts center.Workers could be seen early Thursday transforming the arts complex for the ceremony, while the parking lot beside the building was full of tents and trucks unloading flowers, tables, carpets, wardrobe, and musicians.The locally popular New Orleans funk and jazz band Naughty Professor was seen arriving in the late afternoon, as was the traditional Paulin Brothers Brass Band.Chefs cooked in an outdoor tent, with feasting options including two food trucks as well as an outdoor bar.The Daily Mail said the event would cost more than $1 million and guests would be asked not to bring their cell phones, because an exclusive photo deal had been signed with Vogue.Williams, 36, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, and Ohanian, 34, welcomed their first child, daughter Alexis Olympia, on September 1.They announced their engagement in December after meeting in 2015 in Rome.While New Orleans was no stranger to celebrities and weddings, the star wattage Thursday stirred up extra excitement in the city.Linda Davis and Cora Riley drove four hours from the small Louisiana town of DeRidder just to get a glimpse of the tennis champion. They waited outside the arts complex for hours.\"We love her. She's classy. She and Venus. They never complain,\" Riley told AFP.\"We're so glad she found happiness. Little baby Alexis is so precious,\" said Mary Huber, who was among a small group who took a break from work to observe the hectic scene.Williams won this year's Australian Open while pregnant, and is expected to defend her title in Melbourne in 2018  just four-and-a-half months after giving birth to her child.The Contemporary Arts Center is a large, four-story, multi-disciplinary complex boasting approximately 10,000 square feet (929 square meters) of gallery space.

    "text": "A ballerinas day starts by waking up to pain. Ballet Philippines principal dancer Denise Parungao shares how she powers through it.Published 3:37 PM, November 17, 2017 Rappler in Partnership withMANILA, Philippines  The grace of every ballerinas hop and twirl comes from weeks of painstaking training. We train every day for 8 hours, Tuesday to Saturday. That's a regular week for us. Because of our work, we're actually very prone to injuries. We know that we can be hurt anytime, says Denise Parungao.Some people consider pain as a badge of honor, but for Denise, it is an enemy that has to be defeated. We have high pain tolerance so we're actually not bothered by the pain. We're bothered by the things we cannot do because of the pain. You cant dance less than your hundred percent so when youre in pain, you have to do something about it, she said.Ballet Philippines is one of the longest-standing and most established dance companies in the country. Being its principal dancer requires rigorous training that can take a toll on ones body.I've done shows with stress fractures. I had a growing bone tearing up a tissue and I can't do anything. I can't bend, I can't pli, I can't point. And that's very frustrating. I can't dance, she said.Aside from doing pilates and taking pain killers, Denise believes its more important to be mentally positive and to know that the injury wont last forever. I took a long break from ballet because of injury and every day, I need to tell myself, It's okay. You're going to heal. Just remember how much you love to dance and why you started doing it.After months of rehabilitation, Denise finds a newfound spring in her step as she bounces back in Ballet Philippines Gala Celebration on August 18-20 at the CCP Main Theater.The CCP Main Theater is my home. When you're lost in the moment, if you're that character, you just let go because when we're performing, we have this adrenaline. No matter how tired, no matter how sore, you just keep on going. Every single day we work hard to be on that moment onstage. That break made me realize that I love dancing so much that I want to get back better, she said.  Rappler.com",

Ana de Victorias (CSAV) made history by winning the 2017 Negros Occidental Private Schools Sports Cultural Educational Association (Nopsscea) mens basketball competition with a convincing victory over University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos (UNO-R), 82-64 Friday night.Before the crowd at the STI West Negros University (WNU) Gym in Bacolod City, UNO-R Rams aggressiveness went down the drain as seven-time Nopsscea champion coach Elvis Atinado orchestrated the Titans to create mismatches as CSAV has the tallest average ceiling among the seven collegiate teams this season.Unstoppable Jeffrey Manday, acrobatic Jeric Adorio, slamdunking Cameroonian JR Essakadoualla, Vladimir Pangantihon, Carl Magbanua, delivered the goods for team managers Paolo and PO Cruz who vowed to bring home the title this season.Its been four years since CSAV joined the students' league.Its been our dream to win this championship title and we want it this time having missed it last year, the basketball-loving brothers said.From a ragtag team formed by the siblings in their first year, it took notice in the second year after coach Troy Sarabia injected his skills. The former coach of WNU Mustangs failed, however, to carry the Titans to the top four in his term and John Imperio followed.Imperio, who brought in JR Essakadoulla from Cebu City, brought the team to numerous out of town, friendship, and pocket tournaments which paid off during the Nopsscea wars.CSAV had entered the top four, but lost to UNO-R in the semi-finals and vowed to return, which it did this year.The only difference is that it was not Imperio, but his ally and contemporary Elvis Atinado who steered the Titans bringing in new faces in its backcourt and taller forwards to solidify its campaign.",

Aldeguer said that to make Melindos wish come true, they had to go through a tough negotation process.This is the hardest negotiation we ever had, said Aldeguer.Aldeguer said that the problem in the negotiation was Melindos controversial win against South African Hekkie Budler last Sept. 16 at the Waterfront Hotel and Casino. Carl Zappia scored it 115-113 for Melindo, Takeo Harda had it 117-110 for Melindo, while Glenn Trowbridge had it 115-112 for Budler, who got knocked down in Round 12.Budlers camp filed a complaint in IBF, which ordered a rematch between the two. However, Aldeguer said they were able to convince the IBF to let Melindo face the WBA champion on the condition that the winner between the two will take on Buddler.We had a very hard time in this negotiation because of the issue of Budler. But we made an agreement that whoever wins in the Dec. 31s will fight Budler, said Aldeguer. The dream of Milan has always been a unification bout, so we have to work really hard for this fight.Milendo, who became a world champion with an impressive first round ko over Akira Yaegashi last May 21 in Japan, said he is ready to unify the IBF and WBA belts. He also said that like Yaegashi, Taguchi is a talented fighter but he is confident of his abilities.Both Japanese fighters are very good and strong kay dili man na sila mahimong world champion kon dili na sila maayo, matod ni Melindo. But I have a lot of confidence to myself because I have faith in God.ALA head trainer Edito Villamor said Melindo has to dominate Taguchi so the fight wont go 12 rounds.However, he said he isnt worried of a possilbe hometown decision in Tokyo because it is known to play fair.Ever since before, Tokyo has been known to give fair decisions, but that doesnt mean Milan can be complacent in this fight, said Villamor.Melindo is 37-2 with 13KOs, while Taguchi is 26-2-2 with 12KOs.

It was a ride of a lifetime for the Pirates seeking a first ever title since its NCAA debut in 2011.But fairy tales are just thatfairy tales.When the moment of truth stares one in the face, thats when the tough gets goingand the past, no matter how glorious it might be, matters not much anymore.OK, a rousing roar in that 18-game winning streak included Lyceums two-game sweep of San Bedaa fact that somehow put doubts on the Lions ability to retain their crown this year.But sweeping the elims is one thing, and sweeping the Finals is another.Which sweep is now sweeter between the two?",

That way, we can improve the regions ranking in national competitions, Petilla said.Petilla, during his second term as Leyte governor, established the LSA after the Provincial Government hosted the Palarong Pambansa in 2009. The Leyte Sports Development Center where the LSA is located was the main venue of the school-based sports competition.The creation of LSA was envisioned to look for sports scholar that will help in the improvement of the regions ranking in the annual sports event, without sacrificing academic performance of sports scholars.From 16th place in 2009, Eastern Visayas ranking in Palarong Pambansa inched up to 11th in the 2016 Palarong Pambansa.But Petilla, a former energy secretary, noted in the 2016 Palarong Pambansa that of the 11 gold medals earned by the region, LSA had won 10 of them.The Provincial Government expected to earn more gold medals from LSA athletes in this fifth year of the program.The region will not improve its ranking in Palarong Pambansa if medal gatherers are all from the LSA, said Petilla.To achieve the goal of winning more gold in the Palarong Pambansa, Petilla asked for help of the Provincial Government and the DepEd to convince other local government officials and coaches to support the program by sending their best athletes to LSA.For school year 2016-2017, LSA has 120 sports scholars with only 20 takers from provinces outside Leyte.They are very protective to their athletes not knowing that they can only achieve to a certain level if they will not be trained at LSA. We need to convince the coaches also to bring their athletes to LSA, Petilla said.He added that the academy does not only prepare local athletes for local sports competition, but also for international sports events, wherein some LSA students brought home medals.Leyte Governor Leopoldo Dominico Petilla agreed with his brother saying it is time for LSA to have a wider reach, considering that they are slowly achieving the goal of producing quality athletes.We really need help from other provinces and schools division because if we rely on Leyte alone, we cannot make it to the top. We cannot earn more gold, its hard to attain, Petilla said.But LSA operation this year is facing a budgetary problem after the Commission on Audit disallowed the Provincial Government to use budget under Special Education Fund for sports development.I hope that the Provincial Board will help us to continue this program by approving a supplemental budget that will fund this years operation, said Petilla.Leyte province spends P1.5 million to P2 million every year to support LSA operations.
